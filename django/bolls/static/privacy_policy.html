  <h2 id="PIIProtection">3. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
  <p>Bolls discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its
    employees, contractors and affiliated organisations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on
    Bolls's behalf or to provide services available at Bolls's website, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
    others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organisations may be located outside of your home
    country; by using Bolls's website, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Bolls will not rent or
    sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its
    employees, contractors and affiliated organisations, as described above, Bolls discloses potentially
    personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other
    governmental request, or when Bolls believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
    property or rights of Bolls, third parties or the public at large.</p>
  <p>If you are a registered user of https://bolls.life and have supplied your email address, Bolls may occasionally
    send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's
    going on with Bolls and our products. We primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information, so we
    expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one
    of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your
    request or to help us support other users. Bolls takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the
    unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
    information.</p>
