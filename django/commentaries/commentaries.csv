NABRE,1,1,1,"[1] 1:1-2:3 This section, from the Priestly source, functions as an introduction, as ancient stories of the origin of the world (cosmogonies) often did. It introduces the primordial story (<a href='/NABRE/1/2/4'>2:4</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/26'>11:26</a>), the stories of the ancestors (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/50/26'>50:26</a>), and indeed the whole Pentateuch. The chapter highlights the goodness of creation and the divine desire that human beings share in that goodness. God brings an orderly universe out of primordial chaos merely by uttering a word. In the literary structure of six days, the creation events in the first three days are related to those in the second three. Until modern times the first line was always translated, ""In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth."" Several comparable ancient cosmogonies, discovered in recent times, have a ""when…then"" construction, confirming the translation ""when…then"" here as well. ""When"" introduces the pre-creation state and ""then"" introduces the creative act affecting that state. The traditional translation, ""In the beginning,"" does not reflect the Hebrew syntax of the clause."
NABRE,1,1,2,"[2] This verse is parenthetical, describing in three phases the pre-creation state symbolized by the chaos out of which God brings order: ""earth,"" hidden beneath the encompassing cosmic waters, could not be seen, and thus had no ""form""; there was only darkness; turbulent wind swept over the waters. Commencing with the last-named elements (darkness and water), vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/3'>3-10</a> describe the rearrangement of this chaos: light is made (first day) and the water is divided into water above and water below the earth so that the earth appears and is no longer ""without outline."" The abyss: the primordial ocean according to the ancient Semitic cosmogony. After Gods creative activity, part of this vast body forms the salt-water seas (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/9'>9-10</a>); part of it is the fresh water under the earth (<a href='/NABRE/19/33/7'>PS 33:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/31/4'>EZE 31:4</a>), which wells forth on the earth as springs and fountains (<a href='/NABRE/1/7/11'>GEN 7:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/8/2'>8:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/3/20'>PRO 3:20</a>). Part of it, ""the upper water"" (<a href='/NABRE/19/148/4'>PS 148:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/3/60'>DAN 3:60</a>), is held up by the dome of the sky (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/6'>6-7</a>), from which rain descends on the earth (<a href='/NABRE/1/7/11'>GEN 7:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/7/2'>2KG 7:2, 19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/104/13'>PS 104:13</a>). A mighty wind: literally, ""spirit or breath [ruah] of God""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/8/1'>GEN 8:1</a>."
NABRE,1,1,5,[3] In ancient Israel a day was considered to begin at sunset.
NABRE,1,1,7,"[4] The dome: the Hebrew word suggests a gigantic metal dome. It was inserted into the middle of the single body of water to form dry space within which the earth could emerge. The Latin Vulgate translation firmamentum,""means of support (for the upper waters); firmament,"" provided the traditional English rendering."
NABRE,1,1,26,"[5] Let us make: in the ancient Near East, and sometimes in the Bible, God was imagined as presiding over an assembly of heavenly beings who deliberated and decided about matters on earth (<a href='/NABRE/11/22/19'>1KG 22:19-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/6/8'>ISA 6:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/29/1'>PS 29:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/82/1'>82</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/6'>89:6-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/1/6'>JOB 1:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/2/1'>2:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/38/7'>38:7</a>). This scene accounts for the plural form here and in <a href='/NABRE/1/11/7'>GEN 11:7</a> (""Let us then go down…""). Israels God was always considered ""Most High"" over the heavenly beings. Human beings: Hebrew ādāmis here the generic term for humankind; in the first five chapters of Genesis it is the proper name Adam only at <a href='/NABRE/1/4/25'>4:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/5/1'>5:1-5</a>. In our image, after our likeness: ""image"" and ""likeness"" (virtually synonyms) express the worth of human beings who have value in themselves (human blood may not be shed in <a href='/NABRE/1/9/6'>9:6</a> because of this image of God) and in their task, dominion (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/28'>1:28</a>), which promotes the rule of God over the universe."
NABRE,1,1,27,"[6] Male and female: as God provided the plants with seeds (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/11'>11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/1/12'>12</a>) and commanded the animals to be fertile and multiply (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/22'>22</a>), so God gives sexuality to human beings as their means to continue in existence."
NABRE,1,1,28,"[7] Fill the earth and subdue it: the object of the verb ""subdue"" may be not the earth as such but earth as the territory each nation must take for itself (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/1'>11</a>), just as Israel will later do (see <a href='/NABRE/4/32/22'>NUM 32:22, 29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/18/1'>JOS 18:1</a>). The two divine commands define the basic tasks of the human race—to continue in existence through generation and to take possession of ones God-given territory. The dual command would have had special meaning when Israel was in exile and deeply anxious about whether they would continue as a nation and return to their ancient territory. Have dominion: the whole human race is made in the ""image"" and ""likeness"" of God and has ""dominion."" Comparable literature of the time used these words of kings rather than of human beings in general; human beings were invariably thought of as slaves of the gods created to provide menial service for the divine world. The royal language here does not, however, give human beings unlimited power, for kings in the Bible had limited dominion and were subject to prophetic critique."
NABRE,1,1,29,"[8] According to the Priestly tradition, the human race was originally intended to live on plants and fruits as were the animals (see v. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/30'>30</a>), an arrangement that God will later change (<a href='/NABRE/1/9/3'>9:3</a>) in view of the human inclination to violence."
NABRE,1,2,2,"[1] The mention of the seventh day, repeated in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/3'>3</a>, is outside the series of six days and is thus the climax of the account. The focus of the account is God. The text does not actually institute the practice of keeping the Sabbath, for it would have been anachronistic to establish at this point a custom that was distinctively Israelite (<a href='/NABRE/2/31/13'>EXO 31:13, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/31/17'>17</a>), but it lays the foundation for the later practice. Similarly, ancient creation accounts often ended with the construction of a temple where the newly created human race provided service to the gods who created them, but no temple is mentioned in this account. As was the case with the Sabbath, it would have been anachronistic to institute the temple at this point, for Israel did not yet exist. In <a href='/NABRE/2/25/1'>EXO 25</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/31/1'>31</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/31/35'>35</a>-40, Israel builds the tabernacle, which is the precursor of the Temple of Solomon."
NABRE,1,2,4,"[2] This is the story: the distinctive Priestly formula introduces older traditions, belonging to the tradition called Yahwist, and gives them a new setting. In the first part of Genesis, the formula ""this is the story"" (or a similar phrase) occurs five times (<a href='/NABRE/1/2/4'>2:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/5/1'>5:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/6/9'>6:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>10:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/10'>11:10</a>), which corresponds to the five occurrences of the formula in the second part of the book (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/25/12'>25:12, 19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/36/1'>36:1</a>[9]; 37:2). Some interpret the formula here as retrospective (""Such is the story""), referring back to chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1</a>, but all its other occurrences introduce rather than summarize. It is introductory here; the Priestly source would hardly use the formula to introduce its own material in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1</a>. The cosmogony that begins in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/4'>4</a> is concerned with the nature of human beings, narrating the story of the essential institutions and limits of the human race through their first ancestors. This cosmogony, like <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1:1-3</a> (see note there), uses the ""when…then"" construction common in ancient cosmogonies. The account is generally attributed to the Yahwist, who prefers the divine name ""Yhwh"" (here rendered Lord) for God. God in this story is called ""the LordGod"" (except in <a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>3:1-5</a>); ""Lord"" is to be expected in a Yahwist account but the additional word ""God"" is puzzling."
NABRE,1,2,5,"[3] Man: the Hebrew word adamis a generic term meaning ""human being."" In chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/1'>2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>3</a>, however, the archetypal human being is understood to be male (Adam), so the word adamis translated ""man"" here."
NABRE,1,2,6,"[4] Stream: the water wells up from the vast flood below the earth. The account seems to presuppose that only the garden of God was irrigated at this point. From this one source of all the fertilizing water on the earth, water will be channeled through the garden of God over the entire earth. It is the source of the four rivers mentioned in vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/10'>10-14</a>. Later, with rain and cultivation, the fertility of the garden of God will appear in all parts of the world."
NABRE,1,2,7,"[5] God is portrayed as a potter molding the human body out of earth. There is a play on words in Hebrew between adam(""human being,"" ""man"") and adama(""ground""). It is not enough to make the body from earth; God must also breathe into the mans nostrils. A similar picture of divine breath imparted to human beings in order for them to live is found in <a href='/NABRE/26/37/5'>EZE 37:5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/26/37/9'>9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/20/22'>JHN 20:22</a>. The Israelites did not think in the (Greek) categories of body and soul."
NABRE,1,2,8,"[6] Eden, in the east: the place names in vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/8'>8-14</a> are mostly derived from Mesopotamian geography (see note on vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/10'>10-14</a>). Eden may be the name of a region in southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), the term derived from the Sumerian word eden, ""fertile plain."" A similar-sounding Hebrew word means ""delight,"" which may lie behind the Greek translation, ""The Lord God planted a paradise [= pleasure park] in Eden."" It should be noted, however, that the garden was not intended as a paradise for the human race, but as a pleasure park for God; the man tended it for God. The story is not about ""paradise lost."" The garden in the precincts of Solomons Temple in Jerusalem seems to symbolize the garden of God (like gardens in other temples); it is apparently alluded to in <a href='/NABRE/19/1/3'>PS 1:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/80/10'>80:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/92/14'>92:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/47/7'>EZE 47:7-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/22/1'>REV 22:1-2</a>."
NABRE,1,2,9,"[7] The second tree, the tree of life, is mentioned here and at the end of the story (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/22'>3:22, 24</a>). It is identified with Wisdom in <a href='/NABRE/20/3/18'>PRO 3:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/11/30'>11:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/13/12'>13:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/15/4'>15:4</a>, where the pursuit of wisdom gives back to human beings the life that is made inaccessible to them in <a href='/NABRE/1/3/24'>GEN 3:24</a>. In the new creation described in the Book of Revelation, the tree of life is once again made available to human beings (<a href='/NABRE/66/2/7'>REV 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/22/2'>22:2, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/66/22/19'>19</a>). Knowledge of good and evil: the meaning is disputed. According to some, it signifies moral autonomy, control over morality (symbolized by ""good and evil""), which would be inappropriate for mere human beings; the phrase would thus mean refusal to accept the human condition and finite freedom that God gives them. According to others, it is more broadly the knowledge of what is helpful and harmful to humankind, suggesting that the attainment of adult experience and responsibility inevitably means the loss of a life of simple subordination to God."
NABRE,1,2,10,"[8] 2:10-14 A river rises in Eden: the stream of water mentioned in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/6'>6</a>, the source of all water upon earth, comes to the surface in the garden of God and from there flows out over the entire earth. In comparable religious literature, the dwelling of god is the source of fertilizing waters. The four rivers represent universality, as in the phrase ""the four quarters of the earth."" In <a href='/NABRE/26/47/1'>EZE 47:1-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/14/8'>ZEC 14:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/22/1'>REV 22:1-2</a>, the waters that irrigate the earth arise in the temple or city of God. The place names in vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/11'>11-14</a> are mainly from southern Mesopotamia (modern Iraq), where Mesopotamian literature placed the original garden of God. The Tigris and the Euphrates, the two great rivers in that part of the world, both emptied into the Persian Gulf. Gihon is the modest stream issuing from Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/10/5/8'>2SM 5:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/1/9'>1KG 1:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/32/4'>2CH 32:4</a>), but is here regarded as one of the four great world rivers and linked to Mesopotamia, for Cush here seems to be the territory of the Kassites (a people of Mesopotamia) as in <a href='/NABRE/1/10/8'>GEN 10:8</a>. The word Pishon is otherwise unknown but is probably formed in imitation of Gihon. Havilah seems, according to <a href='/NABRE/1/10/7'>GEN 10:7</a> and <a href='/NABRE/13/1/9'>1CH 1:9</a>, to be in Cush in southern Mesopotamia though other locations have been suggested."
NABRE,1,2,17,"[9] You shall die: since they do not die as soon as they eat from the forbidden tree, the meaning seems to be that human beings have become mortal, destined to die by virtue of being human."
NABRE,1,2,18,"[10] Helper suited to him: lit., ""a helper in accord with him."" ""Helper"" need not imply subordination, for God is called a helper (<a href='/NABRE/5/33/7'>DEU 33:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/46/2'>PS 46:2</a>). The language suggests a profound affinity between the man and the woman and a relationship that is supportive and nurturing."
NABRE,1,2,23,"[11] The man recognizes an affinity with the woman God has brought him. Unlike the animals who were made from the ground, she is made from his very self. There is a play on the similar-sounding Hebrew words ishsha(""woman,"" ""wife"") and ish(""man,"" ""husband"")."
NABRE,1,2,24,"[12] One body: lit., ""one flesh."" The covenant of marriage establishes kinship bonds of the first rank between the partners."
NABRE,1,2,25,"[13] They felt no shame: marks a new stage in the drama, for the reader knows that only young children know no shame. This draws the reader into the next episode, where the couples disobedience results in their loss of innocence."
NABRE,1,3,1,"[1] Cunning: there is a play on the words for ""naked"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/2/25'>2:25</a>) and ""cunning/wise"" (Heb. arum). The couple seek to be ""wise"" but end up knowing that they are ""naked."""
NABRE,1,3,5,"[2] Like gods, who know: or ""like God who knows."""
NABRE,1,3,8,"[3] The breezy time of the day: lit., ""the wind of the day."" Probably shortly before sunset."
NABRE,1,3,14,"[4] Each of the three punishments (the snake, the woman, the man) has a double aspect, one affecting the individual and the other affecting a basic relationship. The snake previously stood upright, enjoyed a reputation for being shrewder than other creatures, and could converse with human beings as in vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>1-5</a>. It must now move on its belly, is more cursed than any creature, and inspires revulsion in human beings (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/3/15'>15</a>)."
NABRE,1,3,15,"[5] They will strike…at their heel: the antecedent for ""they"" and ""their"" is the collective noun ""offspring,"" i.e., all the descendants of the woman. Christian tradition has seen in this passage, however, more than unending hostility between snakes and human beings. The snake was identified with the devil (<a href='/NABRE/70/2/24'>WIS 2:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/8/44'>JHN 8:44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/12/9'>REV 12:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/20/2'>20:2</a>), whose eventual defeat seemed implied in the verse. Because ""the Son of God was revealed to destroy the works of the devil"" (<a href='/NABRE/62/3/8'>1JN 3:8</a>), the passage was understood as the first promise of a redeemer for fallen humankind, the protoevangelium. Irenaeus of Lyons (ca. A.D. 130-200), in his Against Heresies5.21.1, followed by several other Fathers of the Church, interpreted the verse as referring to Christ, and cited <a href='/NABRE/48/3/19'>GAL 3:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/4/4'>4:4</a> to support the reference. Another interpretive translation is ipsa, ""she,"" and is reflected in Jeromes Vulgate. ""She"" was thought to refer to Mary, the mother of the messiah. In Christian art Mary is sometimes depicted with her foot on the head of the serpent."
NABRE,1,3,16,"[6] Toil…pain: the punishment affects the woman directly by increasing the toil and pain of having children. He shall rule over you: the punishment also affects the womans relationship with her husband. A tension is set up in which her urge (either sexual urge or, more generally, dependence for sustenance) is for her husband but he rules over her. But see <a href='/NABRE/22/7/11'>SON 7:11</a>."
NABRE,1,3,17,[7] 3:17-19 Cursed is the ground: the punishment affects the mans relationship to the ground (adamand adamah). You are dust: the punishment also affects the man directly insofar as he is now mortal.
NABRE,1,3,20,"[8] The man gives his wife a more specific name than ""woman"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/2/23'>2:23</a>). The Hebrew name hawwa(""Eve"") is related to the Hebrew word hay(""living""); ""mother of all the living"" points forward to the next episode involving her sons Cain and Abel."
NABRE,1,4,1,"[1] The Hebrew name qayin(""Cain"") and the term qaniti(""I have produced"") present a wordplay that refers to metalworking; such wordplays are frequent in Genesis."
NABRE,1,4,2,"[2] Some suggest the story reflects traditional strife between the farmer (Cain) and the nomad (Abel), with preference for the latter reflecting the alleged nomadic ideal of the Bible. But there is no disparagement of farming here, for Adam was created to till the soil. The story is about two brothers (the word ""brother"" occurs seven times) and Gods unexplained preference for one, which provokes the first murder. The motif of the preferred younger brother will occur time and again in the Bible, e.g., Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and David (<a href='/NABRE/9/16/1'>1SM 16:1-13</a>)."
NABRE,1,4,4,"[3] Fatty portion: it was standard practice to offer the fat portions of animals. Others render, less satisfactorily, ""the choicest of the firstlings."" The point is not that Abel gave a more valuable gift than Cain, but that God, for reasons not given in the text, accepts the offering of Abel and rejects that of Cain."
NABRE,1,4,7,"[4] You will be accepted: the text is extraordinarily condensed and unclear. ""You will be accepted"" is a paraphrase of one Hebrew word, ""lifting."" God gives a friendly warning to Cain that his right conduct will bring ""lifting,"" which could refer to acceptance (lifting) of his future offerings or of himself (as in the Hebrew idiom ""liftingof the face"") or liftingup of his head in honor (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/1/40/13'>40:13</a>), whereas wicked conduct will make him vulnerable to sin, which is personified as a force ready to attack. In any case, Cain has the ability to do the right thing. Lies in wait: sin is personified as a power that ""lies in wait"" (Heb. robes) at a place. In Mesopotamian religion, a related word (rabisu) refers to a malevolent god who attacks human beings in particular places like roofs or canals."
NABRE,1,4,8,[5] Let us go out in the field: to avoid detection. The verse presumes a sizeable population which Genesis does not otherwise explain.
NABRE,1,4,11,"[6] Banned from the ground: lit., ""cursed."" The verse refers back to <a href='/NABRE/1/3/17'>3:17</a> where the ground was cursed so that it yields its produce only with great effort. Cain has polluted the soil with his brothers blood and it will no longer yield any of its produce to him."
NABRE,1,4,15,[7] A mark: probably a tattoo to mark Cain as protected by God. The use of tattooing for tribal marks has always been common among the Bedouin of the Near Eastern deserts.
NABRE,1,4,16,"[8] The land of Nod: a symbolic name (derived from the verb nûd, to wander) rather than a definite geographic region."
NABRE,1,4,17,"[9] 4:17-24 Cain is the first in a seven-member linear genealogy ending in three individuals who initiate action (Jabal, Jubal, and Tubalcain). Other Genesis genealogies also end in three individuals initiating action (<a href='/NABRE/1/5/32'>5:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/26'>11:26</a>). The purpose of this genealogy is to explain the origin of culture and crafts among human beings. The names in this genealogy are the same (some with different spellings) as those in the ten-member genealogy (ending with Noah), which has a slightly different function. See note on <a href='/NABRE/1/5/1'>5:1-32</a>."
NABRE,1,4,23,[10] 4:23-24 Lamechs boast shows that the violence of Cain continues with his son and has actually increased. The question is posed to the reader: how will Gods creation be renewed?
NABRE,1,4,25,"[11] 4:25-26 The third and climactic birth story in the chapter, showing that this birth, unlike the other two, will have good results. The name Seth (from the Hebrew verb shat, ""to place, replace"") shows that God has replaced Abel with a worthy successor. From this favored line Enosh (""human being/humankind""), a synonym of Adam, authentic religion began with the worship of Yhwh; this divine name is rendered as ""the Lord"" in this translation. The Yahwist source employs the name Yhwh long before the time of Moses. Another ancient source, the Elohist (from its use of the term Elohim, ""God,"" instead of Yhwh, ""Lord,"" for the pre-Mosaic period), makes Moses the first to use Yhwh as the proper name of Israels God, previously known by other names as well; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/13'>EXO 3:13-15</a>."
NABRE,1,5,1,"[1] 5:1-32 The second of the five Priestly formulas in Part I (""This is the record of the descendants…""; see <a href='/NABRE/1/2/4'>2:4a</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/6/9'>6:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>10:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/10'>11:10</a>) introduces the second of the three linear genealogies in <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>GEN 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/1'>11</a> (<a href='/NABRE/1/4/17'>4:17-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/10'>11:10-26</a>). In each, a list of individuals (six in <a href='/NABRE/1/4/17'>4:17-24</a>, ten in <a href='/NABRE/1/5/1'>5:1-32</a>, or nine in <a href='/NABRE/1/11/10'>11:10-26</a>) ends in three people who initiate action. Linear genealogies (father to son) in ancient societies had a communicative function, grounding the authority or claim of the last-named individual in the first-named. Here, the genealogy has a literary function as well, advancing the story by showing the expansion of the human race after Adam, as well as the transmission to his descendant Noah of the divine image given to Adam. Correcting the impression one might get from the genealogy in <a href='/NABRE/1/4/17'>4:17-24</a>, this genealogy traces the line through Seth rather than through Cain. Most of the names in the series are the same as the names in Cains line in <a href='/NABRE/1/4/17'>4:17-19</a> (Enosh, Enoch, Lamech) or spelled with variant spellings (Mahalalel, Jared, Methuselah). The genealogy itself and its placement before the flood shows the influence of ancient Mesopotamian literature, which contains lists of cities and kings before and after the flood. Before the flood, the ages of the kings ranged from 18,600 to 36,000 years, but after it were reduced to between 140 and 1,200 years. The biblical numbers are much smaller. There are some differences in the numbers in the Hebrew and Greek manuscripts."
NABRE,1,5,24,"[2] Enoch is in the important seventh position in the ten-member genealogy. In place of the usual formula ""then he died,"" the change to ""Enoch walked with God"" implies that he did not die, but like Elijah (<a href='/NABRE/12/2/11'>2KG 2:11-12</a>) was taken alive to Gods abode. This mysterious narrative spurred much speculation and writing (beginning as early as the third century B.C.) about Enoch the sage who knew the secrets of heaven and who could communicate them to human beings (see <a href='/NABRE/71/44/16'>SIR 44:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/49/14'>49:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/11/5'>HEB 11:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/65/1/14'>JUD 1:14-15</a> and the apocryphal work 1 Enoch)."
NABRE,1,5,29,"[3] The sound of the Hebrew word noah, ""Noah,"" is echoed in the word yenahamenu, ""he will bring us relief""; the latter refers both to the curse put on the soil because of human disobedience (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/17'>3:17-19</a>) and to Noahs success in agriculture, especially in raising grapes for wine (<a href='/NABRE/1/9/20'>9:20-21</a>)."
NABRE,1,5,32,"[4] Shem, Ham, and Japheth: like the genealogies in <a href='/NABRE/1/4/17'>4:17-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/10'>11:10-26</a>, the genealogy ends in three individuals who engage in important activity. Their descendants will be detailed in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>10</a>, where it will be seen that the lineage is political-geographical as well as ""ethnic."""
NABRE,1,6,1,"[1] 6:1-4 These enigmatic verses are a transition between the expansion of the human race illustrated in the genealogy of chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/5/1'>5</a> and the flood depicted in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/6/1'>6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/9/1'>9</a>. The text, apparently alluding to an old legend, shares a common ancient view that the heavenly world was populated by a multitude of beings, some of whom were wicked and rebellious. It is incorporated here, not only in order to account for the prehistoric giants, whom the Israelites called the Nephilim, but also to introduce the story of the flood with a moral orientation—the constantly increasing wickedness of humanity. This increasing wickedness leads God to reduce the human life span imposed on the first couple. As the ages in the preceding genealogy show, life spans had been exceptionally long in the early period, but God further reduces them to something near the ordinary life span."
NABRE,1,6,2,[2] The sons of God: other heavenly beings. See note on <a href='/NABRE/1/1/26'>1:26</a>.
NABRE,1,6,4,"[3] As well as later: the belief was common that human beings of gigantic stature once lived on earth. In some cultures, such heroes could make positive contributions, but the Bible generally regards them in a negative light (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/13/33'>NUM 13:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/32/27'>EZE 32:27</a>). The point here is that even these heroes, filled with vitality from their semi-divine origin, come under Gods decree in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/6/3'>3</a>."
NABRE,1,6,5,"[4] 6:5-8:22 The story of the great flood is commonly regarded as a composite narrative based on separate sources woven together. To the Yahwist source, with some later editorial additions, are usually assigned <a href='/NABRE/1/6/5'>6:5-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/7/1'>7:1-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/7'>7-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/12'>12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/16'>16</a>b, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/17'>17</a>b, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/22'>22</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/7/23'>23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/7/8'>8</a>:<a href='/NABRE/1/7/2'>2</a>b-<a href='/NABRE/1/7/3'>3</a>a, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/6'>6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/7/12'>12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/13'>13</a>b, <a href='/NABRE/1/7/20'>20</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/7/22'>22</a>. The other sections are usually attributed to the Priestly writer. There are differences between the two sources: the Priestly source has two pairs of every animal, whereas the Yahwist source has seven pairs of clean animals and two pairs of unclean; the floodwater in the Priestly source is the waters under and over the earth that burst forth, whereas in the Yahwist source the floodwater is the rain lasting forty days and nights. In spite of many obvious discrepancies in these two sources, one should read the story as a coherent narrative. The biblical story ultimately draws upon an ancient Mesopotamian tradition of a great flood, preserved in the Sumerian flood story, the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic, and (embedded in a longer creation story) the Atrahasis Epic."
NABRE,1,6,6,"[5] His heart was grieved: the expression can be misleading in English, for ""heart"" in Hebrew is the seat of memory and judgment rather than emotion. The phrase is actually parallel to the first half of the sentence (""the Lordregretted…"")."
NABRE,1,6,7,"[6] Human beings are an essential part of their environment, which includes all living things. In the new beginning after the flood, God makes a covenant with human beings and every living creature (<a href='/NABRE/1/9/9'>9:9-10</a>). The same close link between human beings and nature is found elsewhere in the Bible; e.g., in <a href='/NABRE/23/35/1'>ISA 35</a>, Gods healing transforms human beings along with their physical environment, and in <a href='/NABRE/45/8/19'>ROM 8:19-23</a>, all creation, not merely human beings, groans in labor pains awaiting the salvation of God."
NABRE,1,6,11,[7] Corrupt: God does not punish arbitrarily but simply brings to its completion the corruption initiated by human beings.
NABRE,1,6,14,"[8] Gopherwood: an unidentified wood mentioned only in connection with the ark. It may be the wood of the cypress, which in Hebrew sounds like ""gopher"" and was widely used in antiquity for shipbuilding."
NABRE,1,6,15,"[9] Hebrew ""cubit,"" lit., ""forearm,"" is the distance from the elbow to the tip of the middle finger, about eighteen inches (a foot and a half). The dimensions of Noahs ark were approximately 440 × 73 × 44 feet. The ark of the Babylonian flood story was an exact cube, 120 cubits (180 feet) in length, width, and height."
NABRE,1,6,16,"[10] Opening for daylight: a conjectural rendering of the Hebrew word sohar, occurring only here. The reference is probably to an open space on all sides near the top of the ark to admit light and air. The ark also had a window or hatch, which could be opened and closed (<a href='/NABRE/1/8/6'>8:6</a>)."
NABRE,1,6,19,"[11] 6:19-21 You shall bring two of every kind…, one male and one female: For the Priestly source (P), there is no distinction between clean and unclean animals until Sinai (<a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>LEV 11</a>), no altars or sacrifice until Sinai, and all diet is vegetarian (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/29'>GEN 1:29-30</a>); even after the flood P has no distinction between clean and unclean, since ""any living creature that moves about"" may be eaten (<a href='/NABRE/1/9/3'>9:3</a>). Thus P has Noah take the minimum to preserve all species, one pair of each, without distinction between clean and unclean, but he must also take on provisions for food (<a href='/NABRE/1/6/21'>6:21</a>). The Yahwist source (J), which assumes the clean-unclean distinction always existed but knows no other restriction on eating meat (Abel was a shepherd and offered meat as a sacrifice), requires additional clean animals (""seven pairs"") for food and sacrifice (<a href='/NABRE/1/7/2'>7:2-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/8/20'>8:20</a>)."
NABRE,1,6,22,"[12] Just as God had commanded him: as in the creation of the world in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1</a> and in the building of the tabernacle in <a href='/NABRE/2/25/1'>EXO 25</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/31/1'>31</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/31/35'>35-40</a> (all from the Priestly source), everything takes place by the command of God. In this passage and in Exodus, the commands of God are carried out to the letter by human agents, Noah and Moses. Divine speech is important. God speaks to Noah seven times in the flood story."
NABRE,1,7,11,[1] Abyss: the subterranean ocean; see note on <a href='/NABRE/1/1/2'>1:2</a>.
NABRE,1,8,4,"[1] The mountains of Ararat: the mountain country of ancient Arartu in northwest Iraq, which was the highest part of the world to the biblical writer. There is no Mount Ararat in the Bible."
NABRE,1,8,7,"[2] 8:7-12 In the eleventh tablet of the Gilgamesh Epic, Utnapishtim (the equivalent of Noah) released in succession a dove, a swallow, and a raven. When the raven did not return, Utnapishtim knew it was safe to leave the ark. The first century A.D. Roman author Pliny tells of Indian sailors who release birds in order to follow them toward land."
NABRE,1,8,13,"[3] 8:13-14 On the first day of the first month, the world was in the state it had been on the day of creation in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1</a>. Noah had to wait another month until the earth was properly dry as in <a href='/NABRE/1/1/9'>1:9</a>."
NABRE,1,9,1,"[1] God reaffirms without change the original blessing and mandate of <a href='/NABRE/1/1/28'>1:28</a>. In the Mesopotamian epic Atrahasis, on which the Genesis story is partly modeled, the gods changed their original plan by restricting human population through such means as childhood diseases, birth demons, and mandating celibacy among certain groups of women."
NABRE,1,9,2,"[2] 9:2-3 Pre-flood creatures, including human beings, are depicted as vegetarians (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/29'>1:29-30</a>). In view of the human propensity to violence, God changes the original prohibition against eating meat."
NABRE,1,9,4,"[3] Because a living being dies when it loses most of its blood, the ancients regarded blood as the seat of life, and therefore as sacred. Jewish tradition considered the prohibition against eating meat with blood to be binding on all, because it was given by God to Noah, the new ancestor of all humankind; therefore the early Christian Church retained it for a time (<a href='/NABRE/44/15/20'>ACT 15:20, 29</a>)."
NABRE,1,9,6,"[4] The image of God, given to the first man and woman and transmitted to every human being, is the reason that no violent attacks can be made upon human beings. That image is the basis of the dignity of every individual who, in some sense, ""represents"" God in the world."
NABRE,1,9,8,"[5] 9:8-17 God makes a covenant with Noah and his descendants and, remarkably, with all the animals who come out of the ark: never again shall the world be destroyed by flood. The sign of this solemn promise is the appearance of a rainbow."
NABRE,1,9,18,"[6] 9:18-27 The character of the three sons is sketched here. The fault is not Noahs (for he could not be expected to know about the intoxicating effect of wine) but Hams, who shames his father by looking on his nakedness, and then tells the other sons. Hams conduct is meant to prefigure the later shameful sexual practices of the Canaanites, which are alleged in numerous biblical passages. The point of the story is revealed in Noahs curse of Hams son Canaan and his blessing of Shem and Japheth."
NABRE,1,9,27,"[7] In the Hebrew text there is a play on the words yapt(""expand"") and yepet(""Japheth"")."
NABRE,1,10,1,"[1] 10:1-32 Verse 1 is the fourth of the Priestly formulas (<a href='/NABRE/1/2/4'>2:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/5/1'>5:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/6/9'>6:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/10'>11:10</a>) that structure Part I of Genesis; it introduces <a href='/NABRE/1/10/2'>10:2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/9'>11:9</a>, the populating of the world and the building of the city. In a sense, chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/4/1'>4</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/9/1'>9</a> are concerned with the first of the two great commands given to the human race in <a href='/NABRE/1/1/28'>1:28</a>, ""Be fertile and multiply!"" whereas chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/1'>11</a> are concerned with the second command, ""Fill the earth and subdue it!"" (""Subdue it"" refers to each nations taking the land assigned to it by God.) <a href='/NABRE/1/9/19'>GEN 9:19</a> already noted that all nations are descended from the three sons of Noah; the same sentiment is repeated in <a href='/NABRE/1/10/5'>10:5, 18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/25'>25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/32'>32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/8'>11:8</a>. The presupposition of the chapter is that every nation has a land assigned to it by God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/32/8'>DEU 32:8-9</a>). The number of the nations is seventy (if one does not count Noah and his sons, and counts Sidon [vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/15'>15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/19'>19</a>] only once), which is a traditional biblical number (<a href='/NABRE/7/8/30'>JUG 8:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/10/1'>LUK 10:1, 17</a>). According to <a href='/NABRE/1/46/27'>GEN 46:27</a> and <a href='/NABRE/2/1/5'>EXO 1:5</a>, Israel also numbered seventy persons, which shows that it in some sense represents the nations of the earth. This chapter classifies the various peoples known to the ancient Israelites; it is theologically important as stressing the basic family unity of all peoples on earth. It is sometimes called the Table of the Nations. The relationship between the various peoples is based on linguistic, geographic, or political grounds (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/31'>31</a>). In general, the descendants of Japheth (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/2'>2-5</a>) are the peoples of the Indo-European languages to the north and west of Mesopotamia and Syria; the descendants of Ham (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/6'>6-20</a>) are the Hamitic-speaking peoples of northern Africa; and the descendants of Shem (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/21'>21-31</a>) are the Semitic-speaking peoples of Mesopotamia, Syria and Arabia. But there are many exceptions to this rule; the Semitic-speaking peoples of Canaan are considered descendants of Ham, because at one time they were subject to Hamitic Egypt (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/6'>6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/15'>15-19</a>). This chapter is generally considered to be a composite from the Yahwist source (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/8'>8-19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/24'>24-30</a>) and the Priestly source (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>1-7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/22'>22-23</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/31'>31-32</a>). Presumably that is why certain tribes of Arabia are listed under both Ham (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/7'>7</a>) and Shem (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/26'>26-28</a>)."

NABRE,1,11,9,"[5] 11:10-26 The second Priestly genealogy goes from Shem to Terah and his three sons Abram, Nahor, and Haran, just as the genealogy in <a href='/NABRE/1/5/3'>5:3-32</a> went from Adam to Noah and his three sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth. This genealogy marks the important transition in Genesis between the story of the nations in <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/26'>11:26</a> and the story of Israel in the person of its ancestors (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/50/26'>50:26</a>). As chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/11/1'>11</a> showed the increase and spread of the nations, so chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/12/1'>12</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/50/1'>50</a> will show the increase and spread of Israel. The contrast between Israel and the nations is a persistent biblical theme. The ages given here are from the Hebrew text; the Samaritan and Greek texts have divergent sets of numbers in most cases. In comparable accounts of the pre-flood period, enormous life spans are attributed to human beings. It may be an attempt to show that the pre-flood generations were extraordinary and more vital than post-flood human beings."

The Abraham-Sarah stories begin (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27-32</a>) and end with genealogical notices (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/1'>25:1-18</a>), which concern, respectively, the families of Terah and of Abraham. Most of the traditions in the cycle are from the Yahwist source. The so-called Elohist source (E) is somewhat shadowy, denied by some scholars but recognized by others in passages that duplicate other narratives (<a href='/NABRE/1/20/1'>20:1-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/21/22'>21:22-34</a>). The Priestly source consists mostly of brief editorial notices, except for chaps. 17 and 23."
NABRE,1,11,28,"[10] Ur of the Chaldeans: Ur was an extremely ancient city of the Sumerians (later, of the Babylonians) in southern Mesopotamia. The Greek text has ""the land of the Chaldeans."" After a millennium of relative unimportance, Ur underwent a revival during the Neo-Babylonian/Chaldean empire (625-539 B.C.). The sixth-century author here identified the place by its contemporary name. As chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/1'>24</a> shows, Haran in northern Mesopotamia is in fact the native place of Abraham. In the Genesis perspective, the human race originated in the East (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/24'>3:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/4/16'>4:16</a>) and migrated from there to their homelands (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/2'>11:2</a>). Terahs family moved from the East (Ur) and Abraham will complete the journey to the familys true homeland in the following chapters."
NABRE,1,11,29,"[11] Sarai: like Abram, a dialectal variant of the more usual form of the name Sarah. In <a href='/NABRE/1/17/15'>17:15</a>, God will change it to Sarah in view of her new task."
NABRE,1,11,32,"[12] Since Terah was seventy years old when his son Abraham was born (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/11/26'>26</a>), and Abraham was seventy-five when he left Haran (<a href='/NABRE/1/12/4'>12:4</a>), Terah lived in Haran for sixty years after Abrahams departure. According to the tradition in the Samaritan text, Terah died when he was one hundred and forty-five years old, therefore, in the same year in which Abraham left Haran. This is the tradition followed in Stephens speech: Abraham left Haran ""after his father died"" (<a href='/NABRE/44/7/4'>ACT 7:4</a>)."
NABRE,1,12,1,[1] 12:1-3 Go forth…find blessing in you: the syntax of the Hebrew suggests that the blessings promised to Abraham are contingent on his going to Canaan.
NABRE,1,12,2,"[2] The call of Abraham begins a new history of blessing (<a href='/NABRE/1/18/18'>18:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/22/15'>22:15-18</a>), which is passed on in each instance to the chosen successor (<a href='/NABRE/1/26/2'>26:2-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/28/14'>28:14</a>). This call evokes the last story in the primeval history (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/1'>11:1-9</a>) by reversing its themes: Abraham goes forth rather than settle down; it is God rather than Abraham who will make a name for him; the families of the earth will find blessing in him."
NABRE,1,12,3,"[3] Will find blessing in you: the Hebrew conjugation of the verb here and in <a href='/NABRE/1/18/18'>18:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/28/14'>28:14</a> can be either reflexive (""shall bless themselves by you"" = people will invoke Abraham as an example of someone blessed by God) or passive (""by you all the families of earth will be blessed"" = the religious privileges of Abraham and his descendants ultimately will be extended to the nations). In <a href='/NABRE/1/22/18'>22:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/26/4'>26:4</a>, another conjugation of the same verb is used in a similar context that is undoubtedly reflexive (""bless themselves""). Many scholars suggest that the two passages in which the sense is clear should determine the interpretation of the three ambiguous passages: the privileged blessing enjoyed by Abraham and his descendants will awaken in all peoples the desire to enjoy those same blessings. Since the term is understood in a passive sense in the New Testament (<a href='/NABRE/44/3/25'>ACT 3:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/8'>GAL 3:8</a>), it is rendered here by a neutral expression that admits of both meanings."
NABRE,1,12,5,"[4] The ancestors appear in Genesis as pastoral nomads living at the edge of settled society, and having occasional dealings with the inhabitants, sometimes even moving into towns for brief periods. Unlike modern nomads such as the Bedouin, however, ancient pastoralists fluctuated between following the herds and sedentary life, depending on circumstances. Pastoralists could settle down and farm and later resume a pastoral way of life. Indeed, there was a symbiotic relationship between pastoralists and villagers, each providing goods to the other. Persons: servants and others who formed the larger household under the leadership of Abraham; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/14/14'>14:14</a>."
NABRE,1,12,6,"[5] Abrahams journey to the center of the land, Shechem, then to Bethel, and then to the Negeb, is duplicated in Jacobs journeys (<a href='/NABRE/1/33/18'>33:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/35/1'>35:1, 6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/35/27'>27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/46/1'>46:1</a>) and in the general route of the conquest under Joshua (<a href='/NABRE/6/7/2'>JOS 7:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/8/9'>8:9, 30</a>).

NABRE,1,12,9,"[7] 12:10-13:1 Abraham and Sarahs sojourn in Egypt and encounter with Pharaoh foreshadow their descendants experience, suggesting a divine design in which they must learn to trust. The story of Sarah, the ancestor in danger, is told again in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/20/1'>20</a>, and also in <a href='/NABRE/1/26/1'>26:1-11</a> with Rebekah instead of Sarah. Repetition of similar events is not unusual in literature that has been orally shaped."
NABRE,1,12,13,"[8] You are my sister: the text does not try to excuse Abrahams deception, though in <a href='/NABRE/1/20/12'>20:12</a> a similar deception is somewhat excused."
NABRE,1,12,16,"[9] Camels: domesticated camels did not come into common use in the ancient Near East until the end of the second millennium B.C. Thus the mention of camels here (<a href='/NABRE/1/24/11'>24:11-64</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/30/43'>30:43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/31/17'>31:17, 34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/32/8'>32:8, 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/37/25'>37:25</a>) is seemingly an anachronism."
NABRE,1,13,2,"[1] 13:2-18 In this story of Abraham and Lot going their separate ways, Abraham resolves a family dispute by an act that shows both trust in God and generosity toward his nephew. The story suggests Lot rather than Abraham is the natural choice to be the ancestor of a great family; he is young and he takes the most fertile land (outside the land of Canaan). In contrast to Lot, who lifts his eyes to choose for himself (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/13/10'>10-11</a>), Abraham waits for God to tell him to lift his eyes and see the land he will receive (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/13/14'>14</a>). Chaps. 18-19 continue the story of Abraham and Lot. Abrahams visionary possession of the land foreshadows that of Moses (<a href='/NABRE/5/3/27'>DEU 3:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/34/4'>34:4</a>)."
NABRE,1,14,1,"[1] Abraham plays a role with other world leaders. He defeats a coalition of five kings from the east (where, later, Israels enemies lived) and is recognized by a Canaanite king as blessed by God Most High. The historicity of the events is controverted; apart from Shinar (Babylon), Tidal (Hittite Tudhaliya), and Elam, the names and places cannot be identified with certainty. The five cities were apparently at the southern end of the Dead Sea, and all but Bela (i.e., Zoar) were destined for destruction (<a href='/NABRE/1/19/20'>19:20-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/11/8'>HOS 11:8</a>). The passage belongs to none of the traditional Genesis sources; it has some resemblance to reports of military campaigns in Babylonian and Assyrian royal annals."
NABRE,1,14,3,[2] The Salt Sea: the Dead Sea.
NABRE,1,14,13,"[3] Abram the Hebrew: ""Hebrew"" was used by biblical writers for the pre-Israelite ancestors. Linguistically, it is an ethnic term; it may be built on the root Eber, who is the eponymous ancestor of the Israelites, that is, the one to whom they traced their name (<a href='/NABRE/1/10/21'>10:21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/10/24'>24-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/14'>11:14-17</a>), or it may reflect the tradition that the ancestors came from beyond (eber) the Euphrates. It is used only by non-Israelites, or by Israelites speaking to foreigners."
NABRE,1,14,14,"[4] Retainers: the Hebrew word hanikis used only here in the Old Testament. Cognate words appear in Egyptian and Akkadian texts, signifying armed soldiers belonging to the household of a local leader."
NABRE,1,14,18,"[5] Melchizedek, king of Salem (Jerusalem, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/76/3'>PS 76:3</a>), appears with majestic suddenness to recognize Abrahams great victory, which the five local kings were unable to achieve. He prepares a feast in his honor and declares him blessed or made powerful by God Most High, evidently the highest God in the Canaanite pantheon. Abraham acknowledges the blessing by giving a tenth of the recaptured spoils as a tithe to Melchizedek. The episode is one of several allusions to David, king at Jerusalem, who also exercised priestly functions (<a href='/NABRE/10/6/17'>2SM 6:17</a>). <a href='/NABRE/58/7/1'>HEB 7</a> interprets Melchizedek as a prefiguration of Christ. God Most High: in Heb. El Elyon, one of several ""El names"" for God in Genesis, others being El Olam(<a href='/NABRE/1/21/33'>21:33</a>), Elthe God of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/1/33/20'>33:20</a>), El Roi(<a href='/NABRE/1/16/13'>16:13</a>), El Bethel(<a href='/NABRE/1/35/7'>35:7</a>), and El Shaddai(the usual P designation for God in Genesis). All the sources except the Yahwist use El as the proper name for God used by the ancestors. The god El was well-known across the ancient Near East and in comparable religious literature. The ancestors recognized this God as their own when they encountered him in their journeys and in the shrines they found in Canaan."
NABRE,1,14,22,"[6] In vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/14/22'>22-24</a>, Abraham refuses to let anyone but God enrich him. Portrayed with the traits of a later Israelite judge or tribal hero, Abraham acknowledges that his victory is from God alone."
NABRE,1,15,1,"[1] 15:1-21 In the first section (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/1'>1-6</a>), Abraham is promised a son and heir, and in the second (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/7'>7-21</a>), he is promised a land. The structure is similar in both: each of the two promises is not immediately accepted; the first is met with a complaint (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/2'>2-3</a>) and the second with a request for a sign (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/8'>8</a>). Gods answer differs in each section—a sign in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/5'>5</a> and an oath in vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/9'>9-21</a>. Some scholars believe that the Genesis promises of progeny and land were originally separate and only later combined, but progeny and land are persistent concerns especially of ancient peoples and it is hard to imagine one without the other."
NABRE,1,15,6,"[2] Abrahams act of faith in Gods promises was regarded as an act of righteousness, i.e., as fully expressive of his relationship with God. St. Paul (<a href='/NABRE/45/4/1'>ROM 4:1-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/6'>GAL 3:6-9</a>) makes Abrahams faith a model for Christians."
NABRE,1,15,9,"[3] 15:9-17 Cutting up animals was a well-attested way of making a treaty in antiquity. <a href='/NABRE/24/34/17'>JER 34:17-20</a> shows the rite is a form of self-imprecation in which violators invoke the fate of the animals upon themselves. The eighth-century B.C. Sefire treaty from Syria reads, ""As this calf is cut up, thus Mattiel shall be cut up."" The smoking fire pot and the flaming torch (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/17'>17</a>), which represent God, pass between the pieces, making God a signatory to the covenant."
NABRE,1,15,13,"[4] 15:13-16 The verses clarify the promise of the land by providing a timetable of its possession: after four hundred years of servitude, your descendants will actually possess the land in the fourth generation (a patriarchal generation seems to be one hundred years). The iniquity of the current inhabitants (called here the Amorites) has not yet reached the point where God must intervene in punishment. Another table is given in <a href='/NABRE/2/12/40'>EXO 12:40</a>, which is not compatible with this one."
NABRE,1,15,16,"[5] Generation: the Hebrew term doris commonly rendered as ""generation,"" but it may signify a period of varying length. A ""generation"" is the period between the birth of children and the birth of their parents, normally about twenty to twenty-five years. The actual length of a generation can vary, however; in <a href='/NABRE/18/42/16'>JOB 42:16</a> it is thirty-five and in <a href='/NABRE/4/32/13'>NUM 32:13</a> it is forty. The meaning may be life spans, which in <a href='/NABRE/1/6/3'>GEN 6:3</a> is one hundred twenty years and in <a href='/NABRE/23/65/20'>ISA 65:20</a> is one hundred years."
NABRE,1,15,18,"[6] 15:18-21 The Wadi, i.e., a gully or ravine, of Egyptis the Wadi-el-Arish, which is the boundary between the settled land and the Sinai desert. Some scholars suggest that the boundaries are those of a Davidic empire at its greatest extent; others that they are idealized boundaries. Most lists of the ancient inhabitants of the promised land give three, six, or seven peoples, but vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/19'>19-21</a> give a grand total of ten."
NABRE,1,16,1,"[1] 16:1-16 In the previous chapter Abraham was given a timetable of possession of the land, but nothing was said about when the child was to be born. In this chapter, Sarah takes matters into her own hands, for she has been childless ten years since the promise (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/12/4'>12:4</a> with <a href='/NABRE/1/16/16'>16:16</a>). The story is about the two women, Sarah the infertile mistress and Hagar the fertile slave; Abraham has only a single sentence. In the course of the story, God intervenes directly on the side of Hagar, for she is otherwise without resources."
NABRE,1,16,2,"[2] The custom of an infertile wife providing her husband with a concubine to produce children is widely attested in ancient Near Eastern law; e.g., an Old Assyrian marriage contract states that the wife must provide her husband with a concubine if she does not bear children within two years."
NABRE,1,16,4,"[3] Because barrenness was at that time normally blamed on the woman and regarded as a disgrace, it is not surprising that Hagar looks down on Sarah. Ancient Near Eastern legal practice addresses such cases of insolent slaves and allows disciplining of them. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/23'>PRO 30:23</a> uses as an example of intolerable behavior ""a maidservant when she ousts her mistress."""
NABRE,1,16,7,[4] The Lords angel: a manifestation of God in human form; in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/16/13'>13</a> the messenger is identified with God. See note on <a href='/NABRE/2/3/2'>EXO 3:2</a>.
NABRE,1,16,11,"[5] Ishmael: in Hebrew the name means ""God has heard."" It is the same Hebrew verb that is translated ""heeded"" in the next clause. In other ancient Near Eastern texts, the name commemorated the divine answer to the parents prayer to have a child, but here it is broadened to mean that God has ""heard"" Hagars plight. In vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/16/13'>13-14</a>, the verb ""to see"" is similarly broadened to describe Gods special care for those in need."
NABRE,1,16,12,"[6] Alongside: lit., ""against the face of""; the same phrase is used of the lands of Ishmaels descendants in <a href='/NABRE/1/25/18'>25:18</a>. It can be translated ""in opposition to"" (<a href='/NABRE/5/21/16'>DEU 21:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/1/11'>JOB 1:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/6/28'>6:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/21/31'>21:31</a>), but here more likely means that Ishmaels settlement was near but not in the promised land."
NABRE,1,16,13,"[7] God who sees me: Hebrew el-roiis multivalent, meaning either ""God of seeing,"" i.e., extends his protection to me, or ""God sees,"" which can imply seeing human suffering (<a href='/NABRE/1/29/32'>29:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/2/25'>EXO 2:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/57/18'>ISA 57:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/58/3'>58:3</a>). It is probable that Hagar means to express both of these aspects. Remained alive: for the ancient notion that a person died on seeing God, see <a href='/NABRE/1/32/31'>GEN 32:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/20/19'>EXO 20:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/33'>DEU 4:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/13/22'>JUG 13:22</a>."

NABRE,1,17,1,"[1] 17:1-27 The Priestly source gathers the major motifs of the story so far and sets them firmly within a covenant context; the word ""covenant"" occurs thirteen times. There are links to the covenant with Noah (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>1</a> = 6:9; v. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/7'>7</a> = 9:9; v. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/11'>11</a> = 9:12-17). In this chapter, vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>1-8</a> promise progeny and land; vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/9'>9-14</a> are instructions about circumcision; vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/15'>15-21</a> repeat the promise of a son to Sarah and distinguish this promise from that to Hagar; vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/22'>22-27</a> describe Abrahams carrying out the commands. The Almighty: traditional rendering of Hebrew El Shaddai, which is Ps favorite designation of God in the period of the ancestors. Its etymology is uncertain, but its root meaning is probably ""God, the One of the Mountains."""
NABRE,1,17,5,"[2] Abram and Abraham are merely two forms of the same name, both meaning, ""the father is exalted""; another variant form is Abiram (<a href='/NABRE/4/16/1'>NUM 16:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/16/34'>1KG 16:34</a>). The additional -ha-in the form Abraham is explained by popular etymology as coming from ab-hamon goyim, ""father of a multitude of nations."""
NABRE,1,17,10,"[3] Circumcised: circumcision was widely practiced in the ancient world, usually as an initiation rite for males at puberty. By shifting the time of circumcision to the eighth day after birth, biblical religion made it no longer a ""rite of passage"" but the sign of the eternal covenant between God and the community descending from Abraham."
NABRE,1,17,15,"[4] Sarai and Sarah are variant forms of the same name, both meaning ""princess."""
NABRE,1,17,17,"[5] Laughed: yishaq, which is also the Hebrew form of the name ""Isaac""; similar explanations of the name are given in <a href='/NABRE/1/18/12'>GEN 18:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/21/6'>21:6</a>."
NABRE,1,18,1,"[1] Chapters 18 and 19 combined form a continuous narrative, concluding the story of Abraham and his nephew Lot that began in <a href='/NABRE/1/13/2'>13:2-18</a>. The mysterious men visit Abraham in Mamre to promise him and Sarah a child the following year (<a href='/NABRE/1/18/1'>18:1-15</a>) and then visit Lot in Sodom to investigate and then to punish the corrupt city (<a href='/NABRE/1/19/1'>19:1-29</a>). Between the two visits, Abraham questions God about the justice of punishing Sodom (<a href='/NABRE/1/18/16'>18:16-33</a>). At the end of the destruction of Sodom, there is a short narrative about Lot as the ancestor of Moab and the Ammonites (<a href='/NABRE/1/19/30'>19:30-38</a>)."
NABRE,1,18,3,"[2] Abraham addresses the leader of the group, whom he does not yet recognize as the Lord; in the next two verses he speaks to all three men. The other two are later (<a href='/NABRE/1/19/1'>GEN 19:1</a>) identified as angels. The shifting numbers and identification of the visitors are a narrative way of expressing the mysterious presence of God."
NABRE,1,18,6,"[3] Three measures: Hebrew seah; three seahs equal one ephah, about half a bushel."
NABRE,1,18,8,[4] Curds: a type of soft cheese or yogurt.
NABRE,1,18,10,"[5] One of them: i.e., the Lord."
NABRE,1,18,12,"[6] Sarah laughed: a play on the verb ""laugh,"" which prefigures the name of Isaac; see note on <a href='/NABRE/1/17/17'>17:17</a>."
NABRE,1,18,20,"[7] The immorality of the cities was already hinted at in <a href='/NABRE/1/13/13'>13:13</a>, when Lot made his choice to live there. The ""outcry"" comes from the victims of the injustice and violence rampant in the city, which will shortly be illustrated in the treatment of the visitors. The outcry of the Hebrews under the harsh treatment of Pharaoh (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/7'>EXO 3:7</a>) came up to God who reacts in anger at mistreatment of the poor (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/22/21'>EXO 22:21-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/5/7'>ISA 5:7</a>). Sodom and Gomorrah became types of sinful cities in biblical literature. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/9'>ISA 1:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/3/9'>3:9</a> sees their sin as lack of social justice, <a href='/NABRE/26/16/46'>EZE 16:46-51</a>, as disregard for the poor, and <a href='/NABRE/24/23/14'>JER 23:14</a>, as general immorality. In the Genesis story, the sin is violation of the sacred duty of hospitality by the threatened rape of Lots guests."
NABRE,1,19,1,"[1] 19:1-29 The story takes place in one day (counting a day from the previous evening): evening (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/19/1'>1</a>), dawn (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/19/15'>15</a>), and sunrise (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/19/23'>23</a>). The passage resembles <a href='/NABRE/7/19/15'>JUG 19:15-25</a>, which suggests dependence of one story on the other."
NABRE,1,19,2,[2] My lords: Lot does not yet know that the men are Gods messengers; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/18/3'>18:3</a>.
NABRE,1,19,8,[3] Let me bring them out to you: the authority of a patriarch within his house was virtually absolute. Lots extreme response of offering his daughters to a violent mob seems to be motivated by the obligation of hospitality.
NABRE,1,19,11,[4] Blinding light: an extraordinary flash that temporarily dazed the wicked men and revealed to Lot the true nature of his guests.
NABRE,1,19,14,"[5] It is uncertain whether Lots sons-in-law were fully married to his daughters or only ""engaged"" to them (Israelite ""engagement"" was the first part of the marriage ceremony), or even whether the daughters involved were the same as, or different from, the two daughters who were still in their fathers house."
NABRE,1,19,20,"[6] A small place: the Hebrew word misar, lit., ""a little thing,"" has the same root consonants as the name of the town Zoar in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/19/22'>22</a>."
NABRE,1,19,25,"[7] Overthrew: this term, lit., ""turned upside down,"" is used consistently to describe the destruction of the cities of the Plain. The imagery of earthquake and subsequent fire fits the geology of this region."
NABRE,1,19,28,"[8] 19:28-29 In a deft narrative detail, Abraham looks down from the height east of Hebron, from which he could easily see the region at the southern end of the Dead Sea, where the cities of the Plain were probably located."
NABRE,1,19,29,"[9] 19:30-38 This Israelite tale about the origin of Israels neighbors east of the Jordan and the Dead Sea was told partly to ridicule these ethnically related but rival nations and partly to give popular etymologies for their names. The stylized nature of the story is seen in the names of the daughters (""the firstborn"" and ""the younger""), the ease with which they fool their father, and the identical descriptions of the encounters."
NABRE,1,19,37,"[10] From my father: in Hebrew, meabi, similar in sound to the name ""Moab."""
NABRE,1,19,38,"[11] The son of my kin: in Hebrew, ben-ammi, similar in sound to the name ""Ammonites."""
NABRE,1,20,1,"[1] 20:1-18 Abraham again passes off his wife Sarah as his sister to escape trouble in a foreign land (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/12/10'>12:10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/13/1'>13:1</a>, the J source). The story appears to be from a different source (according to some, E) and deals with the ethical questions of the incident. <a href='/NABRE/1/26/6'>GEN 26:6-11</a> is yet another retelling of the story, but with Isaac and Rebekah as characters instead of Abraham and Sarah."
NABRE,1,20,1,"[2] Kadesh and Shur: Kadesh-barnea was a major oasis on the southernmost border of Canaan, and Shur was probably the ""way to Shur,"" the road to Egypt. Gerar was a royal city in the area, but has not been identified with certainty."
NABRE,1,20,6,"[3] Abimelech is exonerated of blame, but by that fact not cleared of the consequences of his act. He is still under the sentence of death for abducting another mans wife; the consequences result from the deed not the intention."
NABRE,1,20,7,"[4] Prophet: only here is Abraham explicitly called ""prophet,"" Hebrew nabi(cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/105/15'>PS 105:15</a>)."
NABRE,1,20,11,"[5] Fear of Godis the traditional though unsatisfactory rendering of Hebrew yirat YHWH, literally, ""revering Yahweh."" The phrase refers neither to the emotion of fear nor to religious reverence of a general kind. Rather it refers to adherence to a single deity (in a polytheistic culture), honoring that deity with prayers, rituals, and obedience. The phrase occurs again in <a href='/NABRE/1/26/24'>26:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/43/23'>43:23</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/1/50/19'>50:19</a>. It is very common in the wisdom literature of the Bible."
NABRE,1,20,12,[6] My sister: marrying ones half sister was prohibited later in Israels history.
NABRE,1,21,1,"[1] 21:1-21 The long-awaited birth of Isaac parallels the birth of Ishmael in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/16/1'>16</a>, precipitating a rivalry and expulsion as in that chapter. Though this chapter is unified, the focus of vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/21/1'>1-7</a> is exclusively on Sarah and Isaac, and the focus of vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/21/8'>8-21</a> is exclusively on Hagar and Ishmael. The promise of a son to the barren Sarah and elderly Abraham has been central to the previous chapters and now that promise comes true with the birth of Isaac. The other great promise, that of land, will be resolved, at least in an anticipatory way, in Abrahams purchase of the cave at Machpelah in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/23/1'>23</a>. The parallel births of the two boys has influenced the Lucan birth narratives of John the Baptist and Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/1'>LUK 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/42/2/1'>2</a>)."

NABRE,1,21,11,"[3] A son of his: Abraham is the father of both boys, but Sarah is the mother only of Isaac. Abraham is very concerned that Ishmael have a sufficient inheritance."
NABRE,1,21,13,[4] I will make a nation of him also: Ishmaels descendants are named in <a href='/NABRE/1/25/12'>25:12-18</a>.
NABRE,1,21,14,"[5] Placing the child on her back: a reading based on an emendation of the traditional Hebrew text. In the traditional Hebrew text, Abraham put the bread and the waterskin on Hagars back, while her son apparently walked beside her. In this way the traditional Hebrew text harmonizes the data of the Priestly source, in which Ishmael would have been at least fourteen years old when Isaac was born; compare <a href='/NABRE/1/16/16'>16:16</a> with <a href='/NABRE/1/21/5'>21:5</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/25'>17:25</a>.

NABRE,1,21,22,"[6] Of the two related promises of progeny and land, that of progeny has been fulfilled in the previous chapter. Now the claim on the land begins to be solidified by Abimelechs recognition of Abrahams claim on the well at Beer-sheba; it will be furthered by Abrahams purchase of the cave at Machpelah in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/23/1'>23</a>. Two levels of editing are visible in the story: (1) vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/21/22'>22-24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/21/27'>27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/21/32'>32</a>, the general covenant with Abimelech; (2) vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/21/25'>25-26</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/21/28'>28-30</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/21/31'>31</a>, Abrahams claim on the well.

NABRE,1,21,23,"[7] This place: Beer-sheba (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/21/31'>31</a>). Abimelech had come from Gerar (<a href='/NABRE/1/20/2'>20:2</a>), about thirty miles west of Beer-sheba."
NABRE,1,21,32,"[8] Philistines: one of the Sea Peoples, who migrated from Mycenaean Greece around 1200 B.C. and settled on the coastland of Canaan, becoming a principal rival of Israel. Non-biblical texts do not use the term ""Philistine"" before ca. 1200 B.C.; it is probable that this usage and those in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/26/1'>26</a> are anachronistic, perhaps applying a later ethnic term for an earlier, less-known one."
NABRE,1,21,33,"[9] God the Eternal: in Hebrew, el olam, perhaps the name of the deity of the pre-Israelite sanctuary at Beer-sheba, but used by Abraham as a title of God; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/28'>ISA 40:28</a>."
NABRE,1,22,1,"[1] 22:1-19 The divine demand that Abraham sacrifice to God the son of promise is the greatest of his trials; after the successful completion of the test, he has only to buy a burial site for Sarah and find a wife for Isaac. The story is widely recognized as a literary masterpiece, depicting in a few lines God as the absolute Lord, inscrutable yet ultimately gracious, and Abraham, acting in moral grandeur as the great ancestor of Israel. Abraham speaks simply, with none of the wordy evasions of chaps. 13 and 21. The style is laconic; motivations and thoughts are not explained, and the reader cannot but wonder at the scene. In vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/15'>15-18</a>, the angel repeats the seventh and climactic promise. Moriah: the mountain is not given a precise geographical location here, though <a href='/NABRE/14/3/1'>2CH 3:1</a> identifies Moriah as the mountain of Jerusalem where Solomon built the Temple; Abraham is thus the first to worship there. The word ""Moriah"" is a play on the verb ""to see"" (Heb. raah); the wordplay is continued in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/8'>8</a>, ""God will provide (lit., ""see"")"" and in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/14'>14</a>, Yahweh-yireh, meaning ""the Lord will see/provide."""
NABRE,1,22,9,"[2] Bound: the Hebrew verb is aqad,from which is derived the noun Akedah, ""the binding (of Isaac),"" the traditional Jewish name for this incident."
NABRE,1,22,13,"[3] While the Bible recognizes that firstborn males belong to God (<a href='/NABRE/2/13/11'>EXO 13:11-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/19'>34:19-20</a>), and provides an alternate sacrifice to redeem firstborn sons, the focus here is on Abrahams being tested by God (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/1'>1</a>). But the widely attested practice of child sacrifice underscores, for all its horror today, the realism of the test."
NABRE,1,22,14,"[4] Yahweh-yireh: a Hebrew expression meaning ""the Lord will see/provide."" See note on vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/1'>1-19</a>."
NABRE,1,22,15,"[5] 22:15-19 The seventh and climactic statement of the blessings to Abraham. Unlike the other statements, which were purely promissory, this one is presented as a reward for Abrahams extraordinary trust."
NABRE,1,22,19,"[6] 22:20-24 The descendants to the second generation of Nahor, Abrahams brother, who married Milcah. Of Terahs three sons (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27</a>), the oldest, Abraham, fathered Isaac (<a href='/NABRE/1/21/1'>21:1-7</a>), and the youngest, Haran (who died in Ur), fathered Lot. Abraham is now told that Nahor had eight children by Milcah and four by his concubine Reumah. Apart from the notice about the children born to Abraham by his second wife, Keturah (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/1'>25:1-6</a>), all the information about Terahs family to the second generation is now complete. It is noteworthy that Jacob will, like Nahor, have eight children by his wives and four by his concubines."
NABRE,1,23,1,"[1] 23:1-20 The occasion for purchasing the land is the need for a burial site for Sarah, for it would be unthinkable to bury Sarah outside of the promised land. One of the two great promises to Abraham, that of progeny, has been fulfilled (<a href='/NABRE/1/21/1'>21:1-7</a>). And now the promise of land is to be fulfilled, through a kind of down payment on the full possession that will take place only with the conquest under Joshua and during the reign of David. This purchase has been prepared for by Abimelechs recognition of Abrahams claim to the well at Beer-sheba (<a href='/NABRE/1/21/22'>21:22-34</a>). Among the ancestral stories this narrative is one of two that are entirely from the P source (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>17</a> being the other). The Priestly writers may have intended to encourage the generation of the exile to a renewed hope of repossessing their land."
NABRE,1,23,3,"[2] The Hittites: in the Bible the term is applied to several different groups—inhabitants of the second-millennium Hittite empire in Asia Minor and northern Syria, residents of the Neo-Hittite kingdoms in northern Syria in the first part of the first millennium, and (following Assyrian terminology) the inhabitants of Syria and Palestine. The third group is meant here."
NABRE,1,23,4,"[3] A resident alien: such a one would normally not have the right to own property. The importance of Abrahams purchase of the field in Machpelah, which is worded in technical legal terms, lies in the fact that it gave his descendants their first, though small, land rights in the country that God had promised the patriarch they would one day inherit as their own. Abraham therefore insists on purchasing the field and not receiving it as a gift."
NABRE,1,23,15,"[4] Four hundred shekels: probably an exorbitant sum; Jeremiah (<a href='/NABRE/1/32/9'>32:9</a>) paid only seventeen shekels for his field in Anathoth, though the Babylonian invasion no doubt helped to reduce the price."
NABRE,1,23,16,[5] The current market value: the standard weight called a shekel varied according to time and place.
NABRE,1,24,1,"[1] 24:1-67 The story of Abraham and Sarah is drawing to a close. The promises of progeny (<a href='/NABRE/1/21/1'>21:1-7</a>) and land (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/23/1'>23</a>) have been fulfilled and Sarah has died (<a href='/NABRE/1/23/1'>23:1-2</a>). Abrahams last duty is to ensure that his son Isaac shares in the promises. Isaac must take a wife from his own people (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/3'>3-7</a>), so the promises may be fulfilled. The extraordinary length of this story and its development of a single theme contrast strikingly with the spare style of the preceding Abraham and Sarah stories. It points ahead to the Jacob and Joseph stories. The length of the story is partly caused by its meticulous attention to the sign (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/12'>12-14</a>), its fulfillment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/15'>15-20</a>), and the servants retelling of sign and fulfillment to Rebekahs family to win their consent (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/34'>34-49</a>)."
NABRE,1,24,2,"[2] Put your hand under my thigh: the symbolism of this act was apparently connected with the Hebrew concept of children issuing from their fathers ""thigh"" (the literal meaning of ""direct descendants"" in <a href='/NABRE/1/46/26'>46:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/1/5'>EXO 1:5</a>). Perhaps the man who took such an oath was thought to bring the curse of sterility on himself if he did not fulfill his sworn promise. Jacob made Joseph swear in the same way (<a href='/NABRE/1/47/29'>GEN 47:29</a>). In both these instances, the oath was taken to carry out the last request of a man upon his death."
NABRE,1,24,10,"[3] Nahor: it is uncertain whether this is the place where Abrahams brother Nahor (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27</a>) had lived or whether it is the city Nahur, named in the Mari documents (nineteenth and eighteenth centuries B.C.), near the confluence of the Balikh and Middle Euphrates rivers. Aram Naharaim: lit., ""Aram between the two rivers,"" is the Yahwist designation for Terahs homeland. The two rivers are the Habur and the Euphrates. The Priestly designation for the area is Paddan-aram, which is from the Assyrian padana,""road or garden,"" and Aram, which refers to the people or land of the Arameans."
NABRE,1,24,12,[4] Let it turn out favorably for me: let me have a favorable sign; cf. end of v. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/14'>14</a>.
NABRE,1,24,30,"[5] Laban becomes hospitable only when he sees the servants rich gifts, which is in humorous contrast to his sisters spontaneous generosity toward the servant. Labans opportunism points forward to his behavior in the Jacob stories (<a href='/NABRE/1/31/14'>31:14-16</a>)."
NABRE,1,24,41,[6] Curse: this would be the consequence of failing to carry out the oath referred to in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/3'>3</a>.
NABRE,1,24,58,"[7] Marriages arranged by the womans father did not require the womans consent, but marriages arranged by the womans brother did. Laban is the brother and Rebekah is therefore free to give her consent or not."
NABRE,1,25,1,"[1] 25:1-11 As with the story of Terah in <a href='/NABRE/1/11/27'>11:27-32</a>, this section lists all the descendants of Abraham as a means of concluding the story. The Jacob story ends similarly with the listing of the twelve sons (<a href='/NABRE/1/35/22'>35:22-26</a>), the death of Isaac (<a href='/NABRE/1/35/27'>35:27-29</a>), and the descendants of Esau (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/36/1'>36</a>). Abraham took another wife: though mentioned here, Abrahams marriage to a ""concubine,"" or wife of secondary rank, is not to be understood as happening chronologically after the events narrated in the preceding chapter."
NABRE,1,25,2,"[2] Three of the six names can be identified: the Midianites are a trading people, mentioned in the Bible as dwelling east of the Gulf of Aqaba in northwest Arabia; Ishbak is a north Syrian tribe; Shuah is a city on the right bank of the Middle Euphrates. The other names are probably towns or peoples on the international trade routes."
NABRE,1,25,5,"[3] Amid so many descendants, Abraham takes steps that Isaac will be his favored heir."
NABRE,1,25,6,"[4] The land of Kedem: or ""the country of the East,"" the region inhabited by the Kedemites or Easterners (<a href='/NABRE/1/29/1'>29:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/6/3'>JUG 6:3, 33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/1/3'>JOB 1:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/11/14'>ISA 11:14</a>). The names mentioned in vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/25/2'>2-4</a>, as far as they can be identified, are those of tribes in the Arabian desert."
NABRE,1,25,12,"[5] Like the conclusion of the Jacob story (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/36/1'>36</a>), where the numerous descendants of the rejected Esau are listed, the descendants of the rejected Ishmael conclude the story."
NABRE,1,25,18,"[6] Pitched camp: lit., ""fell""; the same Hebrew verb is used in <a href='/NABRE/7/7/12'>JUG 7:12</a> in regard to the hostile encampment of desert tribes. The present passage shows the fulfillment of the prediction contained in <a href='/NABRE/1/16/12'>GEN 16:12</a>."
NABRE,1,25,19,"[7] 25:19-36:43 The Jacob cycle is introduced as the family history of Isaac (Jacobs father), just as the Abraham stories were introduced as the record of the descendants of Terah (Abrahams father, 11:27). The cycle, made up of varied stories, is given unity by several recurring themes: birth, blessing and inheritance, which are developed through the basic contrasts of barrenness/fertility, non-blessing/blessing, and inheritance/exile/homeland. The large story has an envelope structure in which Jacobs youth is spent in Canaan striving with his older brother Esau (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/19'>25:19</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/28/22'>28:22</a>), his early adulthood in Paddan-aram building a family and striving with his brother-in-law Laban (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/29/1'>29</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/31/1'>31</a>), and his later years back in Canaan (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/32/1'>32</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/36/1'>36</a>)."
NABRE,1,25,20,"[8] Paddan-aram: the name used by the Priestly tradition for the northwest region of Mesopotamia, between the Habur and the Euphrates rivers. In Assyrian, padanais a road or a garden, and Aram refers to the people or the land of the Arameans. The equivalent geographical term in the Yahwist source is Aram Naharaim, ""Aram between two rivers."""
NABRE,1,25,22,"[9] If it is like this: in Hebrew, the phrase lamah zehis capable of several meanings; it occurs again in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/25/32'>32</a> (""What good…?""), 32:30 (""Why do you want…?""), and <a href='/NABRE/1/33/15'>33:15</a> (""For what reason?""). It is one of several words and motifs that run through the story, suggesting that a divine pattern (unknown to the actors) is at work."
NABRE,1,25,23,"[10] The older will serve the younger: Rebekah now knows something that no one else knows, that God favors Jacob over Esau. The text does not say if she shared this knowledge with anyone or kept it to herself, but, from their actions, it seems unlikely that either Isaac or Esau knew. That fact must be borne in mind in assessing Rebekahs role in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/1'>27</a>, the theft of Esaus blessing."
NABRE,1,25,25,"[11] Reddish: in Hebrew, admoni, a reference to Edom, another name for Esau (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/25/30'>30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/36/1'>36:1</a>). Edom was also the name of the country south of Moab (southeast of the Dead Sea) where the descendants of Esau lived. It was called the ""red"" country because of its reddish sandstone. Moreover, ""red"" points ahead to the red stew in the next scene. Hairy: in Hebrew, sear, a reference to Seir, another name for Edom (<a href='/NABRE/1/36/8'>36:8</a>)."
NABRE,1,25,26,"[12] Heel: in Hebrew aqeb, a wordplay on the name Jacob; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/36'>27:36</a>. The first of three scenes of striving with Esau. The second is vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/25/27'>27-34</a>, and the third, chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/1'>27</a>. In all the scenes, Jacob values the blessing more than his ardent but unreflective brother Esau does."
NABRE,1,25,27,"[13] Simple: the Hebrew word denotes soundness, integrity, health, none of which fit here. Whatever its precise meaning, it must be opposite to the qualities of Esau."
NABRE,1,25,30,"[14] Red stuff: in Hebrew, adom; another play on the word Edom, the ""red"" land."
NABRE,1,25,31,"[15] Right as firstborn: the privilege that entitled the firstborn son to a position of honor in the family and to a double share in the possessions inherited from the father. There is a persistent wordplay between bekorah, ""right of the firstborn,"" and berakah, ""the blessing."" Contrary to custom, the preference here is for the younger son, as it was in the choice of Isaac over Ishmael."
NABRE,1,26,1,"[1] The promise of land and numerous descendants given to Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/1/12/1'>12:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/15/1'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/22/17'>22:17-18</a>) is renewed for his son Isaac.

NABRE,1,26,6,"[2] 26:6-11 This scene is the third version of the wife-in-danger story (cf. chaps. 12 and 20). The mention of the famine in <a href='/NABRE/1/26/1'>26:1</a> recalls the famine in <a href='/NABRE/1/12/10'>12:10</a>; the name Abimelech, king of the Philistines in Gerar, recalls <a href='/NABRE/1/20/2'>20:2</a>. The deception, according to all the stories, is the claim that the wife is a sister. This story (from the Yahwist source) departs from the two previous accounts in that the wife is not taken into the harem of the foreign king."
NABRE,1,26,12,"[3] 26:12-33 The dispute is over water rights. In a sparsely watered land, wells were precious and claims on water could function as a kind of claim on the land. Scholars generally judge the account of the dispute over water rights and its settlement by a legal agreement between Isaac and Abimelech to be a Yahwist version of the similar story about Abraham in <a href='/NABRE/1/21/22'>21:22-34</a>. Here, Abimelech realizes that Isaac has brought blessing to his people and thus desires a covenant with him. The feast in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/26/30'>30</a> is part of the covenant ceremony."

NABRE,1,26,33,"[7] Shibah: the place name Shibah is a play on two Hebrew words, shebuah, ""oath,"" and shwebaa, ""seven."" In v. <a href='/NABRE/1/26/31'>31</a>, they exchanged oaths."
NABRE,1,26,34,[8] 26:34-35 These verses from the Priestly source introduce the next section on Esaus loss of his right as firstborn by suggesting a motivation for this in Isaacs and Rebekahs dislike for Esaus Canaanite wives.
NABRE,1,27,1,"[1] 27:1-45 The chapter, a literary masterpiece, is the third and climactic wresting away of the blessing of Esau. Rebekah manages the entire affair, using perhaps her privileged information about Jacobs status (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/23'>25:23</a>); Jacobs only qualm is that if his father discovers the ruse, he will receive a curse instead of a blessing (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/11'>11-12</a>). Isaac is passive as he was in chaps. 22 and 24. The deception is effected through clothing (Jacob wears Esaus clothing), which points ahead to a similar deception of a patriarch by means of clothing in the Joseph story (<a href='/NABRE/1/37/21'>37:21-33</a>). Such recurrent acts and scenes let the reader know a divine purpose is moving the story forward even though the human characters are unaware of it."
NABRE,1,27,4,"[2] I may bless you: Isaacs blessing confers fertility (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/27'>27-28</a>) and dominion (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/29'>29</a>). The ""dew of heaven"" is rain that produces grain and wine, two of the principal foodstuffs of the ancient Near East. The ""fertility of the earth"" may allude to oil, the third basic foodstuff. The full agricultural year may be implied here: the fall rains are followed by the grain harvests of the spring and the grape harvest of late summer, and then the olive harvest of the fall (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/11/14'>DEU 11:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/104/13'>PS 104:13-15</a>)."
NABRE,1,27,36,"[3] He has supplanted me: in Hebrew, wayyaqebeni, a wordplay on the name Jacob, yaaqob; see <a href='/NABRE/24/9/3'>JER 9:3</a> and <a href='/NABRE/1/25/26'>GEN 25:26</a>. There is also a play between the Hebrew words bekorah(""right of the firstborn"") and berakah(""blessing"")."
NABRE,1,28,1,"[1] 28:1-9 A glimpse of Rebekahs shrewdness is provided by <a href='/NABRE/1/27/42'>27:42</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/28/2'>28:2</a>. She is aware of Esaus murderous plot against Jacob (<a href='/NABRE/1/27/42'>27:42-45</a>) but realizes the episode of the stolen blessing is still painful to Isaac; she therefore uses another motive to persuade Isaac to send Jacob away—he must marry within the family (endogamy), unlike Esau. Esau, unreflective as usual, realizes too late he also should marry within the family but, significantly, marries from Abrahams rejected line. At this point in the story, Jacob (and his mother) have taken the blessing for themselves. Their actions have put Jacob in a precarious position: he must flee the land because of his brothers murderous intent and find a wife in a far country. One might ask how Gods blessing can be given to such an unworthy schemer. There is a biblical pattern of preferring the younger brother or sister over the older—Isaac over Ishmael, Jacob over Esau, Rachel over Leah, Joseph over his older brothers, Ephraim over Manasseh (<a href='/NABRE/1/48/14'>GEN 48:14</a>), David over his older brothers."
NABRE,1,28,9,"[2] 28:10-22 As Jacob is leaving the land on his way to an uncertain future in Paddan-aram, God appears to him at a sacred place that Jacob had visited only to take a nights rest. Jacobs unawareness of the holiness of the place underscores the graciousness of the gift. On his return to Canaan, he will again encounter a divine visitor in the form of the mysterious attacker (<a href='/NABRE/1/32/23'>32:23-33</a>) and, after his return and reconciliation with Esau, he will again go to Bethel (<a href='/NABRE/1/35/1'>35:1-15</a>)."
NABRE,1,28,11,"[3] Place: the Hebrew word is often used specifically of a sacred site. The ambiguous word ""place"" is used here, for the text emphasizes that Jacob has no idea the place he has come upon is sacred; only when he wakes up does he realize it is sacred. The place was Bethel (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/28/19'>19</a>), a sacred site as early as the time of Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/1/12/8'>12:8</a>)."
NABRE,1,28,12,"[4] Stairway: in Hebrew, sullam, traditionally but inaccurately translated as ""ladder.""

The imagery in Jacobs dream may be derived from the Babylonian ziggurat or temple tower, ""with its top in the sky"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/11/4'>11:4</a>), and with brick steps leading up to a small temple at the top."
NABRE,1,28,18,"[5] Sacred pillar: in Hebrew, masseba, a stone which might vary in shape and size, set upright and usually intended for some religious purpose. The custom of erecting such sacred pillars in Palestine went back to its pre-Israelite period; but since their polytheistic associations were often retained, later Israelite religion forbade their erection (<a href='/NABRE/3/26/1'>LEV 26:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/22'>DEU 16:22</a>) and ordered the destruction of those that were associated with other religions (<a href='/NABRE/2/34/13'>EXO 34:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/12/3'>DEU 12:3</a>)."

NABRE,1,29,1,"[1] 29:1-14 Jacobs arrival in Haran. The sight of Rachel inspires Jacob to the superhuman feat of rolling back the enormous stone by himself. The scene evokes the meeting of Abrahams steward and Jacobs mother Rebekah at a well (<a href='/NABRE/1/24/11'>24:11-27</a>). The verse begins the story of Jacobs time in Mesopotamia (<a href='/NABRE/1/29/1'>29:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/31/54'>31:54</a>), which is framed on either side by Jacobs time in Canaan, 25:19-28:22 and <a href='/NABRE/1/32/1'>32:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/36/43'>36:43</a>. In these chapters, Jacob suffers Labans duplicity as Esau had to suffer his, though eventually Jacob outwits Laban and leaves Mesopotamia a wealthy man.

The major irony is that Jacob, the deceiver of his father and brother about the blessing (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/1'>27</a>), is deceived by his uncle (standing in for the father) about his wife."

Jacobs neglect of Leah moves God to make her fruitful (<a href='/NABRE/1/29/31'>29:31</a>). Leahs fertility provokes Rachel. Leah bears Jacob four sons (Reuben, Levi, Simeon, and Judah) and her maidservant Zilpah, two (Gad and Asher). Rachels maidservant Bilhah bears two (Dan and Naphtali). After the mandrakes (<a href='/NABRE/1/30/14'>30:14-17</a>), Leah bears Issachar and Zebulun and a daughter Dinah. Rachel then bears Joseph and, later in the land of Canaan, Benjamin (<a href='/NABRE/1/35/18'>35:18</a>)."
NABRE,1,29,32,"[8] Reuben: the literal meaning of the Hebrew name is disputed. One interpretation is reu ben,""look, a son!"", but here in Genesis (as also with the names of all the other sons of Jacob), it is given a symbolic rather than an etymological interpretation. Name and person were regarded as closely interrelated. The symbolic interpretation of Reubens name, according to the Yahwist source, is based on the similar-sounding raa beonyi, ""he saw my misery."" In the Elohist source, the name is explained by the similar-sounding yeehabani, ""he will love me."""

To enter into the Lords second promise, the land, he must now return to Canaan."
NABRE,1,30,32,"[12] Dark…lambs…spotted or speckled…goats: in the Near East the normal color of sheep is light gray, whereas that of goats is dark brown or black. A minority of sheep in that part of the world have dark patches, and a minority of goats, white markings. Laban is quick to agree to the offer, for Jacob would have received only a few animals. But Jacob gets the better of him, using two different means: (1) he separates out the weaker animals and then provides visual impressions to the stronger animals at mating time (a folkloric belief); (2) in <a href='/NABRE/1/31/8'>31:8-12</a>, he transmits the preferred characteristics through controlled propagation. It should be noted that Jacob has been told what to do in a dream (<a href='/NABRE/1/31/10'>31:10</a>) and that God is behind the increase in his flocks."
NABRE,1,30,35,"[13] By giving the abnormally colored animals to his sons, Laban not only deprived Jacob of his first small wages, but he also schemed to prevent the future breeding of such animals in the flock entrusted to Jacob."

Laban calls them his ""gods"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/31/30'>30</a>).

The cunning Jacob manages to wrest a blessing from the night stranger before he departs. There are folkloric elements in the tale—e.g., the trial of the hero before he can return home, the nocturnal demons loss of strength at sunrise, the demon protecting its river, the power gained by knowledge of an opponents name—but these have been worked into a coherent though elliptical narrative. The point of the tale seems to be that the ever-striving, ever-grasping Jacob must eventually strive with God to attain full possession of the blessing."

Jacob in return asks Esau to accept his blessing (berakah, translated ""gift,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/1/33/11'>11</a>), giving back at least symbolically what he had taken many years before and responding to Esaus erstwhile complaint (""he has taken away my blessing,"" 27:36).

The lines of both Ishmael and Esau are introduced by the same double formula, ""These are the descendants of…"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/12'>25:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/36/9'>36:9</a>) and ""These are the names of the sons of…"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/13'>25:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/36/10'>36:10</a>).

NABRE,1,36,31,"[5] Before any king reigned over the Israelites: obviously this statement was written after the time of Saul, Israels first king. According to <a href='/NABRE/9/14/47'>1SM 14:47</a>, Saul waged war against the Edomites; according to <a href='/NABRE/10/8/2'>2SM 8:2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/8/13'>13-14</a> and <a href='/NABRE/11/11/14'>1KG 11:14-17</a>, David made Edom a vassal state and nearly wiped out the royal line.

NABRE,1,37,1,"[1] The statement points ahead to <a href='/NABRE/1/47/27'>47:27</a>, ""Thus Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the region of Goshen."" These two statements frame the Joseph narrative; the later material (<a href='/NABRE/1/47/28'>47:28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/49/33'>49:33</a>) is about Jacob; chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/50/1'>50</a> brings to a conclusion themes remaining from the earlier story. One aim of the Joseph story is to explain how Israel came to Egypt after sojourning so long in Canaan."
NABRE,1,37,2,"[2] The Joseph story is great literature not only in its themes but in its art. The stories show an interest in the psychology of the characters; everyone acts ""in character"" yet there is never a doubt that a divine purpose is bringing events to their conclusion. According to a literary analysis, vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/37/1'>1-4</a> set the scene; vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/37/5'>5-36</a> introduce the dramatic tension in the form of a conflict within the family; chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/1'>38</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/41/1'>41</a> describe the journeys away from their family of the eponymous ancestors of the two great tribes of later times, Judah (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/1'>38</a>) and Joseph (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/39/1'>39</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/41/1'>41</a>) and their preliminary conclusions; chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/42/1'>42</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/44/1'>44</a> detail the famine and journeys for food (chaps. 42, 43) that bring the brothers and (indirectly) the father into fresh contact with a mature Joseph who now has the power of life and death over them; 45:1-47:27 is the resolution (reconciliation of Joseph to his brothers) and the salvation of the family."
NABRE,1,37,3,"[3] Jacobs favoring Joseph over his other sons is a cause of the brothers attempt on his life. Throughout the story, Jacob is unaware of the impact of his favoritism on his other sons (cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/37/33'>33-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/42/36'>42:36</a>). Long ornamented tunic: the meaning of the Hebrew phrase is unclear. In <a href='/NABRE/10/13/18'>2SM 13:18-19</a>, it is the distinctive dress of unmarried royal daughters. The ""coat of many colors"" in the Septuagint became the traditional translation. Ancient depictions of Semites in formal dress show them with long, ornamented robes and that is the most likely meaning here. Possibly, the young Joseph is given a coat that symbolizes honor beyond his years. Later, Pharaoh will clothe Joseph in a robe that symbolizes honor (<a href='/NABRE/1/41/42'>41:42</a>)."
NABRE,1,37,5,"[4] 37:5-10 Josephs dreams of ruling his brothers appear at first glance to be merely adolescent grandiosity, and they bring him only trouble. His later successes make it clear, however, that they were from God. Another confirmation of their divine source is the doubling of dreams (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/41/32'>41:32</a>)."
NABRE,1,37,21,"[5] 37:21-36 The chapter thus far is from the Yahwist source, as are also vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/37/25'>25-28</a>a. But vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/37/21'>21-24</a> and <a href='/NABRE/1/37/28'>28b-36</a> are from another source (sometimes designated the Elohist source). In the latter, Reuben tries to rescue Joseph, who is taken in Reubens absence by certain Midianites; in the Yahwist source, it is Judah who saves Josephs life by having him sold to certain Ishmaelites. Although the two variant forms in which the story was handed down in early oral tradition differ in these minor points, they agree on the essential fact that Joseph was brought as a slave into Egypt because of the jealousy of his brothers."
NABRE,1,37,28,"[6] They sold Joseph…silver: editors tried to solve the confusion, created by different sources, by supposing that it was the Midianite traders who pulled Joseph out of the pit and sold him to Ishmaelites. In all probability, one source had the brothers selling Joseph to Ishmaelites, whereas the other had them cast him into the pit whence he was taken by Midianite traders."

NABRE,1,38,1,"[1] 38:1-30 This chapter has subtle connections to the main Joseph story. It tells of the eponymous founder of the other great tribe of later times, Judah. Having already been introduced as one of the two good brothers in <a href='/NABRE/1/37/26'>37:26-27</a>, he appears here as the father-in-law of the twice-widowed Tamar; he has reneged on his promise to provide his son Shelah to her in a levirate marriage. Unjustly treated, Tamar takes matters into her own hands and tricks Judah into becoming the father of her children, Perez and Zerah. Judah ultimately acknowledges that his daughter-in-law was right (""She is in the right rather than I,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/26'>26</a>). In contrast to Judahs expectations, the family line does not continue through his son Shelah, but through the children of Tamar. Similarities relate this little story to the main narrative: the deception involving an article of clothing (the widows garments of Tamar, Judahs seal, cord, and staff) point back to the bloody tunic that deceives Jacob in <a href='/NABRE/1/37/31'>37:31-33</a>; a woman attempts the seduction of a man separated from his family, for righteous purposes in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/1'>38</a>, for unrighteous purposes in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/39/1'>39</a>."
NABRE,1,38,5,"[2] Chezib: a variant form of Achzib (<a href='/NABRE/6/15/44'>JOS 15:44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/1/14'>MIC 1:14</a>), a town in the Judean Shephelah."
NABRE,1,38,8,"[3] Preserve your brothers line: lit., ""raise up seed for your brother"": an allusion to the law of levirate, or ""brother-in-law,"" marriage; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/5/25/5'>DEU 25:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/8/2/20'>RUT 2:20</a>. Onans violation of this law brought on him Gods punishment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/9'>9-10</a>)."
NABRE,1,38,18,"[4] Seal and cord: the cylinder seal, through which a hole was bored lengthwise so that it could be worn from the neck by a cord, was a distinctive means of identification. Apparently ones staff could also be marked with some sign of identification (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/17/17'>NUM 17:17-18</a>)."
NABRE,1,38,21,"[5] Prostitute: the Hebrew term qedesha, lit., ""consecrated woman,"" designates a woman associated with a sanctuary whose activities could include prostitution; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/23/18'>DEU 23:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/4/14'>HOS 4:14</a>, where the same Hebrew word is used. In <a href='/NABRE/1/38/15'>38:15</a> and <a href='/NABRE/1/38/24'>24</a> the common word for prostitute, zona, is used."
NABRE,1,38,29,"[6] He was called Perez: the Hebrew word means ""breach."""
NABRE,1,38,30,"[7] He was called Zerah: a name connected here by popular etymology with a Hebrew word for the red light of dawn, alluding apparently to the crimson thread."
NABRE,1,40,1,[1] Joseph interprets the dreams of the Pharaohs two officials. His ability to interpret the dreams shows that God is still with him and points forward to his role of dream interpreter for Pharaoh in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/41/1'>41</a>.

NABRE,1,41,8,"[2] Magicians: one of the tasks of the ""magicians"" was interpreting dreams. The interpretation of dreams was a long-standing practice in Egypt. A manual of dream interpretation has been found, written in the early second millennium and re-published later in which typical dreams are given (""If a man sees himself in a dream…"") followed by a judgment of ""good"" or ""bad."" Interpreters were still needed for dreams, however, and Pharaoh complains that none of his dream interpreters can interpret his unprecedented dream. The same term will be used of Pharaohs magicians in Exodus."
NABRE,1,41,42,"[3] Signet ring: a finger ring in which was set a stamp seal, different from the cylinder seal such as Judah wore; see note on <a href='/NABRE/1/38/18'>38:18</a>. By receiving Pharaohs signet ring, Joseph was made vizier of Egypt (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/41/43'>43</a>); the vizier was known as ""seal-bearer of the king of Lower Egypt."" The gold chain was a symbol of high office in ancient Egypt."

NABRE,1,41,45,"[5] Zaphenath-paneah: a Hebrew transcription of an Egyptian name meaning ""the god speaks and he (the newborn child) lives."" Asenath: means ""belonging to (the Egyptian goddess) Neith."" Potiphera: means ""he whom Ra (the Egyptian god) gave""; a shorter form of the same name was borne by Josephs master (<a href='/NABRE/1/37/36'>37:36</a>). Heliopolis: in Hebrew, On, a city seven miles northeast of modern Cairo, site of the chief temple of the sun god; it is mentioned also in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/41/50'>50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/46/20'>46:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/30/17'>EZE 30:17</a>."

NABRE,1,42,1,"[1] 42:1-38 The first journey of the brothers to Egypt. Its cause is famine, which was also the reason Abraham and Sarah undertook their dangerous journey to Egypt. The brothers bow to Joseph in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/42/6'>6</a>, which fulfills Josephs dream in <a href='/NABRE/1/37/5'>37:5-11</a>. Endowed with wisdom, Joseph begins a process of instruction or ""discipline"" for his brothers that eventually forces them to recognize the enormity of their sin against him and the family. He controls their experience of the first journey with the result that the second journey in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/1/43/1'>43</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/44/1'>44</a> leads to full acknowledgment and reconciliation."
NABRE,1,42,9,"[2] 42:9, 12 Weak points: lit., ""the nakedness of the land""; the military weakness of the land, like human nakedness, should not be seen by strangers."
NABRE,1,43,1,"[1] 43:1-34 The second journey to Egypt. Joseph the sage has carefully prepared the brothers for a possible reconciliation. In this chapter and the following one Judah steps forward as the hero, in contrast to chaps. 37 and 42 where Reuben was the hero. Here Judah serves as guarantee for Benjamin."

NABRE,1,43,34,"[3] Five times as large as: probably an idiomatic expression for ""much larger than."" Cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/45/22'>45:22</a>."
NABRE,1,44,1,"[1] 44:1-34 Josephs pressure on his brothers and Judahs great speech. Judah has the longest speech in the Book of Genesis; it summarizes the recent past (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/44/18'>18-29</a>), shows the pain Josephs actions have imposed on their aged father (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/44/30'>30-32</a>), and ends with the offer to take the place of Benjamin as servant of Joseph (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/44/33'>33-34</a>). The role of Judah in the entire story is exceedingly important and is easily underrated: he tries to rescue Joseph (<a href='/NABRE/1/37/26'>37:26-27</a>), his ""going down away from the brothers"" is parallel to Josephs (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/1'>38</a>) and prepares him (as it prepares Joseph) for the reconciliation, his speech in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/44/1'>44</a> persuades Joseph to reveal himself and be reconciled to his brothers. Here, Judah effectively replaces Reuben as a spokesman for the brothers. Jacob in his testament (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/49/1'>49</a>) devotes the most attention to Judah and Joseph. In one sense, the story can be called the story of Joseph and Judah."
NABRE,1,44,5,"[2] Divination: seeking omens through liquids poured into a cup or bowl was a common practice in the ancient Near East; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/1/44/15'>15</a>. Even though divination was frowned on in later Israel (<a href='/NABRE/3/19/31'>LEV 19:31</a>), it is in this place an authentic touch which is ascribed to Joseph, the wisest man in Egypt."
NABRE,1,44,16,[3] Guilt: in trying to do away with Joseph when he was young.
NABRE,1,44,19,[4] My lord asked his servants: such frequently repeated expressions in Judahs speech show the formal court style used by a subject in speaking to a high official.
NABRE,1,45,1,[1] 45:1-28 Joseph reveals his identity and the family is reconciled.
NABRE,1,45,8,[2] Father to Pharaoh: a term applied to a vizier in ancient Egypt.
NABRE,1,45,9,"[3] 45:9-15 In these verses, as in <a href='/NABRE/1/46/31'>46:31</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/47/5'>47:5</a>a, all from the Yahwist source, Joseph in his own name invites his father and brothers to come to Egypt. Only after their arrival is Pharaoh informed of the fact. On the other hand, in <a href='/NABRE/1/45/16'>45:16-20</a>, which scholars have traditionally attributed to the Elohist source, it is Pharaoh himself who invites Josephs family to migrate to his domain."
NABRE,1,45,10,[4] The region of Goshen: the meaning of the term is unknown. It is found in no Egyptian source. It is generally thought to be in the modern Wadi Tumilat in the eastern part of the Nile Delta.
NABRE,1,46,1,[1] 46:1-47:26 Jacob and his family settle in Egypt. Josephs economic policies.
NABRE,1,46,3,"[2] I am God: more precisely according to the Hebrew text, ""I am El."" ""El"" is here a divine name, not the common noun ""god."""
NABRE,1,46,9,[3] 46:9-27 This genealogical list is based on the clan lists (<a href='/NABRE/4/26/5'>NUM 26:5-50</a>) from the Mosaic period.
NABRE,1,46,27,"[4] Seventy persons: it is difficult to get this exact number by adding up the persons mentioned in the preceding genealogies. One might assume it refers to Jacob and sixty-nine descendants, excluding Er and Onan but including Dinah. <a href='/NABRE/2/1/5'>EXO 1:5</a> repeats the number but excludes Jacob. <a href='/NABRE/5/10/22'>DEU 10:22</a> refers to seventy persons descending to Egypt. The best solution is to take the number as expressing totality. Since there are seventy nations in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/1'>10</a>, it is likely that the text is drawing a parallel between the two entities and suggesting that Israel ""represents"" the nations before God."
NABRE,1,46,32,"[5] Owners of livestock: the phrase occurs only here and in v. <a href='/NABRE/1/46/34'>34</a>. The difference between this term and ""shepherds"" is not clear, for the brothers do not mention it to Pharaoh in <a href='/NABRE/1/47/3'>47:3</a>."

NABRE,1,47,28,"[3] 47:28-50:26 Supplements to the Joseph story. Most of the material in this section centers on Jacob—his blessing of Josephs sons, his farewell testament, and his death and burial in Canaan. Only the last verses (<a href='/NABRE/1/50/15'>50:15-26</a>) redirect attention to Jacobs sons, the twelve brothers; they are assured that the reconciliation will not collapse after the death of the patriarch."
NABRE,1,47,31,"[4] Israel bowed at the head of the bed: meaning perhaps that he gave a nod of assent and appreciation as he lay on his bed. The oath and gesture are the same as Abrahams in <a href='/NABRE/1/24/2'>24:2</a>. Israels bowing here suggests the fulfillment of Josephs dreams in <a href='/NABRE/1/37/9'>37:9-10</a>, when parents and brothers bowed down to Joseph (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/42/6'>42:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/43/26'>43:26</a>). By using different vowels for the Hebrew word for ""bed,"" the Greek version translated it as ""staff,"" and understood the phrase to mean that he bowed in worship, leaning on the top of his staff; it is thus quoted in <a href='/NABRE/58/11/21'>HEB 11:21</a>."
NABRE,1,48,1,"[1] 48:1-22 Jacob continues his preparations for death. In a scene that evokes the nearly blind Isaac blessing Jacob and Esau (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/1'>27</a>), Jacob blesses Josephs two sons. He adopts them, elevating them to a status equal to that of Jacobs first sons Reuben and Simeon (cf. <a href='/NABRE/13/5/1'>1CH 5:1</a>). The adoption is one more instance of Jacobs favoring Rachel and those born of her. The mention of Jacobs failing eyesight and his selection of the younger son over the older evokes the great deathbed scene in chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/27/1'>27</a>. He reaffirms to Joseph the ancient divine promise of progeny and land."
NABRE,1,48,3,[2] Luz: an older name of Bethel (<a href='/NABRE/1/28/19'>28:19</a>).
NABRE,1,48,7,"[3] Since her early death prevented Rachel from bearing more than two sons, Jacob feels justified in treating her two grandsons as if they were her own offspring."
NABRE,1,48,22,"[4] Both the meaning of the Hebrew and the historical reference in this verse are obscure. By taking the Hebrew word for Shechem as a common noun meaning shoulder or mountain slope, some translators render the verse, ""I give you one portion more than your brothers, which I captured…"" The reference may be to the capture of Shechem by the sons of Jacob (<a href='/NABRE/1/34/24'>34:24-29</a>). Shechem lay near the border separating the tribal territory of Manasseh from that of Ephraim (<a href='/NABRE/6/16/4'>JOS 16:4-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/17/1'>17:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/6/17/7'>7</a>)."
NABRE,1,49,1,"[1] 49:1-27 The testament, or farewell discourse, of Jacob, which has its closest parallel in Moses farewell in <a href='/NABRE/5/33/6'>DEU 33:6-25</a>. From his privileged position as a patriarch, he sees the future of his children (the eponymous ancestors of the tribes) and is able to describe how they will fare and so gives his blessing. The dense and archaic poetry is obscure in several places. The sayings often involve wordplays (explained in the notes). The poem begins with the six sons of Leah (vv. <a href='/NABRE/1/49/2'>2-15</a>), then deals with the sons of the two secondary wives, and ends with Rachels two sons, Joseph and Benjamin. Reuben, the oldest son, loses his position of leadership as a result of his intercourse with Bilhah (<a href='/NABRE/1/35/22'>35:22</a>), and the words about Simeon and Levi allude to their taking revenge for the rape of Dinah (chap. <a href='/NABRE/1/34/1'>34</a>). The preeminence of Judah reflects his rise in the course of the narrative (mirroring the rise of Joseph). See note on <a href='/NABRE/1/44/1'>44:1-34</a>."
NABRE,1,49,5,"[2] 49:5-7 This passage probably refers to their attack on the city of Shechem (<a href='/NABRE/1/34/1'>GEN 34</a>). Because there is no indication that the warlike tribe of Levi will be commissioned as a priestly tribe (<a href='/NABRE/2/32/26'>EXO 32:26-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/33/11'>DEU 33:11</a>), this passage reflects an early, independent tradition."
NABRE,1,49,5,"[3] Knives: if this is the meaning of the obscure Hebrew word here, the reference may be to the knives used in circumcising the men of Shechem (<a href='/NABRE/1/34/24'>34:24</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/5/2'>JOS 5:2</a>)."
NABRE,1,49,10,"[4] Until tribute comes to him: this translation is based on a slight change in the Hebrew text, which, as it stands, would seem to mean, ""until he comes to Shiloh."" A somewhat different reading of the Hebrew text would be, ""until he comes to whom it belongs."" This last has been traditionally understood in a messianic sense. In any case, the passage aims at the supremacy of the tribe of Judah and of the Davidic dynasty."
NABRE,1,49,11,"[5] In wine…the blood of grapes: Judahs clothes are poetically pictured as soaked with grape juice from trampling in the wine press, the rich vintage of his land; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/63/2'>ISA 63:2</a>."
NABRE,1,49,16,"[6] In Hebrew the verb for ""achieve justice"" is from the same root as the name Dan."
NABRE,1,49,18,[7] This short plea for divine mercy has been inserted into the middle of Jacobs testament.
NABRE,1,49,19,"[8] In Hebrew there is assonance between the name Gad and the words for ""raided,"" ""raiders,"" and ""raid."""
NABRE,1,49,25,[9] 49:25-26 A very similar description of the agricultural riches of the tribal land of Joseph is given in <a href='/NABRE/5/33/13'>DEU 33:13-16</a>.
NABRE,1,50,10,"[1] 50:10-11 Goren-ha-atad: ""Threshing Floor of the Brambles."" Abel-mizraim: although the name really means ""watercourse of the Egyptians,"" it is understood here, by a play on the first part of the term, to mean ""mourning of the Egyptians."" The site has not been identified through either reading of the name. But it is difficult to see why the mourning rites should have been held in the land beyond the Jordan when the burial was at Hebron. Perhaps an earlier form of the story placed the mourning rites beyond the Wadi of Egypt, the traditional boundary between Canaan and Egypt (<a href='/NABRE/4/34/5'>NUM 34:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/15/4'>JOS 15:4, 47</a>)."
NABRE,1,50,15,"[2] 50:15-26 The final reconciliation of the brothers. Fearful of what may happen after the death of their father, the brothers engage in a final deception, inventing the dying wish of Jacob. Again, Joseph weeps, and, again, his brothers fall down before him, offering to be his slaves (<a href='/NABRE/1/44/16'>44:16, 33</a>). Josephs assurance is also a summation of the story: ""Even though you meant harm to me, God meant it for good, to achieve this present end, the survival of many people"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/1/50/20'>20</a>). Josephs adoption of the children of Manassehs son Machir recalls Jacobs adoption of his grandchildren (<a href='/NABRE/1/48/5'>48:5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/48/13'>13-20</a>); the adoptions reflect tribal history (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/5/14'>JUG 5:14</a>)."
NABRE,2,1,1,"[1] Sons of Israel: here literally the first-generation sons of Jacob/Israel. Cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/2/1/5'>5</a>. However, beginning with v. <a href='/NABRE/2/1/7'>7</a> the same Hebrew phrase refers to Jacobs more remote descendants; hence, from there on, it is ordinarily rendered ""the Israelites."" Households: the family in its fullest sense, including wives, children and servants."
NABRE,2,1,2,[2] Jacobs sons are listed here according to their respective mothers. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/29/31'>GEN 29:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/30/20'>30:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/35/16'>35:16-26</a>.
NABRE,2,1,5,"[3] Direct descendants: lit., ""persons coming from Jacobs loins""; hence, wives of Jacobs sons and servants are not included. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/46/26'>GEN 46:26</a>. Seventy: <a href='/NABRE/1/46/26'>GEN 46:26</a>, along with the Septuagint for the verse, agrees on a total of sixty-six coming down to Egypt with Jacob, but in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/1/27'>27</a> the Hebrew text adds the two sons born to Joseph in Egypt and presupposes Jacob himself and Joseph for a total of seventy; the Septuagint adds ""nine sons"" born to Joseph to get a total of seventy-five. This is the figure the Septuagint and 4QExahave here in <a href='/NABRE/2/1/5'>EXO 1:5</a>."
NABRE,2,1,7,"[4] Fruitful…multiplied…the land was filled with them: the language used here to indicate the fecundity of the Israelite population echoes the divine blessing bestowed upon humanity at creation (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/28'>GEN 1:28</a>) and after the flood (<a href='/NABRE/1/9/1'>GEN 9:1</a>) as well as suggesting fulfillment of the promises to the ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (<a href='/NABRE/1/12/2'>GEN 12:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/13/16'>13:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/15/5'>15:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/28/14'>28:14</a>; passim)."
NABRE,2,1,8,"[5] Who knew nothing of Joseph: the nuance intended by the Hebrew verb ""know"" here goes beyond precise determination. The idea may be not simply that a new king came to power who had not heard of Joseph but that this king ignored the services that Joseph had rendered to Egypt, repudiating the special relationship that existed between Joseph and his predecessor on the throne."
NABRE,2,1,10,[6] Increase: Pharaohs actions thereby immediately pit him against Gods will for the Israelites to multiply; see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/2/1/7'>7</a> above.
NABRE,2,1,11,"[7] Pharaoh: not a personal name, but a title common to all the kings of Egypt."
NABRE,2,1,14,"[8] Mortar: either the wet clay with which the bricks were made, as in <a href='/NABRE/34/3/14'>NAH 3:14</a>, or the cement used between the bricks in building, as in <a href='/NABRE/1/11/3'>GEN 11:3</a>."
NABRE,2,1,16,[9] Birthstool: apparently a pair of stones on which the mother is seated for childbirth opposite the midwife. The Hebrew word elsewhere is used to refer to the stones of a potters wheel.
NABRE,2,2,1,"[1] Now a man: the chapter begins abruptly, without names for the man or woman (in contrast to the midwives of <a href='/NABRE/2/1/15'>1:15</a>), who in <a href='/NABRE/2/6/20'>6:20</a> are identified as Amram and Jochebed."
NABRE,2,2,3,"[2] Basket: the same Hebrew word is used in <a href='/NABRE/1/6/14'>GEN 6:14</a> and throughout the flood narrative for Noahs ark, but nowhere else in the Bible. Here, however, the ""ark"" or ""chest"" was made of papyrus stalks. Presumably the allusion to Genesis is intentional. Just as Noah and his family were preserved safe from the threatening waters of the flood in the ark he built, so now Moses is preserved from the threatening waters of the Nile in the ark prepared by his mother. Among the reeds: the Hebrew noun for ""reed"" is overwhelmingly used in the phrase ""Reed Sea,"" traditionally translated ""Red Sea."""
NABRE,2,2,9,[3] And I will pay your wages: the idea that the childs mother will be paid for nursing her child—and by Pharaohs own daughter—heightens the narratives irony.
NABRE,2,2,10,"[4] When the child grew: while v. <a href='/NABRE/2/2/9'>9</a> implies that the boys mother cared for him as long as he needed to be nursed (presumably, between two and four years), the same verb appears in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/2/11'>11</a> to describe the attainment of adulthood. And he became her son: Pharaohs daughter adopts Moses, thus adding to the irony of the account. The king of Egypt had ordered the killing of all the sons of the Hebrews, and one now becomes the son of his own daughter! Moses: in Hebrew, mosheh. There is a play on words here: Hebrew moshehechoes meshithihu(""I drew him out""). However, the name Moses actually has nothing to do with that Hebrew verb, but is probably derived from Egyptian ""beloved"" or ""has been born,"" preserved in such Pharaonic names as Thutmoses (meaning approximately ""Beloved of the god Thoth"" or ""The god Thoth is born, has given birth to [the child]""). The original meaning of Moses name was no longer remembered (if it was Egyptian, it may have contained an Egyptian divine element as well, perhaps the name of the Nile god Hapi), and a secondary explanation was derived from this story (or gave rise to it, if the drawing from the water of the Nile was intended to foreshadow the Israelites escape from Egypt through the Red Sea)."
NABRE,2,2,11,"[5] After Moses had grown up: cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/7/7'>7:7</a>, where Moses is said to be eighty years old at the time of his mission to Pharaoh. Striking: probably in the sense of ""flogging""; in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/2/12'>12</a>, however, the same verb is used in the sense of ""killing."""
NABRE,2,2,15,"[6] Land of Midian: the territory under the control of a confederation made up, according to <a href='/NABRE/4/31/8'>NUM 31:8</a>, of five Midianite tribes. According to <a href='/NABRE/1/25/1'>GEN 25:1-2</a>, Midian was a son of Abraham by Keturah. In view of the extreme hostility in later periods between Israel and Midian (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/31/1'>NUM 31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/6/1'>JUG 6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/7/8/1'>8</a>), the relationship is striking, as is the account here in Exodus of good relations between Moses and no less than a Midianite priest."

NABRE,2,2,19,"[8] An Egyptian: Moses was probably wearing Egyptian dress, or spoke Egyptian to Reuels daughters."
NABRE,2,2,22,"[9] Gershom: the name is explained unscientifically as if it came from the Hebrew word ger, ""sojourner, resident alien,"" and the Hebrew word sham, ""there."" Stranger residing: Hebrew ger, one who seeks and finds shelter and a home away from his or her own people or land."
NABRE,2,2,25,"[10] God knew: in response to the peoples cry, God, mindful of the covenant, looks on their plight and acknowledges firsthand the depth of their suffering (see <a href='/NABRE/2/3/7'>3:7</a>). In vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/2/23'>23-25</a>, traditionally attributed to the Priestly writer, God is mentioned five times, in contrast to the rest of chaps. <a href='/NABRE/2/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/2/1'>2</a>, where God is rarely mentioned. These verses serve as a fitting transition to Moses call in chap. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/1'>3</a>."
NABRE,2,3,1,"[1] 3:1-4:17 After the introduction to the narrative in <a href='/NABRE/2/2/23'>2:23-25</a>, the commissioning itself falls into three sections: Gods appearance under the aspect of a burning bush (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/1'>3:1-6</a>); the explicit commission (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/7'>3:7-10</a>); and an extended dialogue between Moses and God, in the course of which Moses receives the revelation of Gods personal name. Although in the J source of the Pentateuch people have known and invoked Gods personal name in worship since the time of Seth (<a href='/NABRE/1/4/26'>GEN 4:26</a>), for the E and P sources (see <a href='/NABRE/2/6/2'>6:2-4</a>) God first makes this name publicly available here through Moses."
NABRE,2,3,1,"[2] The mountain of God, Horeb: traditionally, ""Horeb"" is taken to be an alternate name in E source material and Deuteronomy (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/5/1/2'>DEU 1:2</a>) for what in J and P is known as Mount Sinai, the goal of the Israelites journey after leaving Egypt and the site of the covenant God makes with Israel. However, it is not clear that originally the two names reflect the same mountain, nor even that ""Horeb"" refers originally to a mountain and not simply the dry, ruined region (from Hebrew horeb, ""dryness, devastation"") around the mountain. Additionally, the position of ""Horeb"" at the end of the verse may indicate that the identification of the ""mountain of God"" with Horeb (= Sinai?) represents a later stage in the evolution of the tradition about Gods meeting with Moses. The phrase ""mountain of God"" simply anticipates the divine apparitions which would take place there, both on this occasion and after the Israelites departure from Egypt; alternatively, it means that the place was already sacred or a place of pilgrimage in pre-Israelite times. In any case, the narrative offers no indications of its exact location."
NABRE,2,3,2,"[3] The angel of the Lord: Hebrew malakor ""messenger"" is regularly translated angelosby the Septuagint, from which the English word ""angel"" is derived, but the Hebrew term lacks connotations now popularly associated with ""angel"" (such as wings). Although angels frequently assume human form (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/18/1'>GEN 18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/19/1'>19</a>), the term is also used to indicate the visual form under which God occasionally appeared and spoke to people, referred to indifferently in some Old Testament texts either as Gods ""angel,"" malak, or as God. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/16/7'>GEN 16:7, 13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/14/19'>EXO 14:19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/14/24'>24-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/22/22'>NUM 22:22-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/6/11'>JUG 6:11-18</a>. The bush: Hebrew seneh, perhaps ""thorny bush,"" occurring only here in vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/2'>2-4</a> and in <a href='/NABRE/5/33/16'>DEU 33:16</a>. Its use here is most likely a wordplay on Sinai (Hebrew sinay), implying a popular etymology for the name of the sacred mountain."
NABRE,2,3,6,"[4] God of your father: a frequently used epithet in Genesis (along with the variants ""my father"" and ""your father"") for God as worshiped by the ancestors. As is known from its usage outside of the Bible in the ancient Near East, it suggests a close, personal relationship between the individual and the particular god in question, who is both a patron and a protector, a god traditionally revered by the individuals family and whose worship is passed down from father to son. The God of Abraham…Jacob: this precise phrase (only here and in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/4/5'>4:5</a>) stresses the continuity between the new revelation to Moses and the earlier religious experience of Israels ancestors, identifying the God who is now addressing Moses with the God who promised land and numerous posterity to the ancestors. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/22/32'>MAT 22:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/12/26'>MAK 12:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/20/37'>LUK 20:37</a>. Afraid to look at God: the traditions about Moses are not uniform in regard to his beholding or not being able to look at God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/24/11'>24:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/33/11'>33:11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/33/18'>18-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/29'>34:29-35</a>). Here Moses reaction is the natural and spontaneous gesture of a person suddenly confronted with a direct experience of God. Aware of his human frailty and the gulf that separates him from the God who is holy, he hides his face. To encounter the divine was to come before an awesome and mysterious power unlike any other a human being might experience and, as such, potentially threatening to ones very identity or existence (see <a href='/NABRE/1/32/30'>GEN 32:30</a>)."
NABRE,2,3,8,"[5] I have come down: cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/11/5'>GEN 11:5, 7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/18/21'>18:21</a>. Flowing with milk and honey: an expression denoting agricultural prosperity, which seems to have been proverbial in its application to the land of Canaan. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/13/5'>EXO 13:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/13/27'>NUM 13:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/5/6'>JOS 5:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/11/5'>JER 11:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/32/22'>32:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/20/6'>EZE 20:6, 15</a>."
NABRE,2,3,11,"[6] Who am I: this question is always addressed by an inferior to a superior (to the ruler in <a href='/NABRE/9/18/18'>1SM 18:18</a>; to God in <a href='/NABRE/10/7/18'>2SM 7:18</a> and its parallel, <a href='/NABRE/13/17/16'>1CH 17:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/29/14'>1CH 29:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/2/5'>2CH 2:5</a>). In response to some special opportunity or invitation, the question expresses in a style typical of the ancient Near East the speakers humility or gratitude or need of further assistance, but never unwillingness or an outright refusal to respond. Instead the question sets the stage for further support from the superior should that be needed (as here)."
NABRE,2,3,12,"[7] Sign: a visible display of the power of God. The ancient notion of a sign from God does not coincide with the modern understanding of ""miracle,"" which suggests some disruption in the laws governing nature. While most any phenomenon can become a vehicle for displaying the purposes and providence of God, here the sign intended to confirm Moses commission by God seems to be the burning bush itself. Since normally the giving of such a sign would follow the commission rather than precede it (see <a href='/NABRE/7/6/11'>JUG 6:11-24</a>), some see Israels service of God at Sinai after the exodus from Egypt as the confirmatory sign, albeit retroactively. It is more likely, however, that its mention here is intended to establish the present episode with Moses alone as a prefigurement of Gods fiery theophany to all Israel on Mount Sinai. Serve God: Hebrew -b-d, ""serve,"" includes among its meanings both the notion of ""serving or working for another"" and the notion of ""worship."" The implication here is that the Israelites service/worship of God is incompatible with their service to Pharaoh."
NABRE,2,3,14,"[8] I am who I am: Moses asks in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/13'>13</a> for the name of the One speaking to him, but God responds with a wordplay which preserves the utterly mysterious character of the divine being even as it appears to suggest something of the inner meaning of Gods name: ehyeh""I am"" or ""I will be(come)"" for ""Yhwh,"" the personal name of the God of Israel. While the phrase ""I am who I am"" resists unraveling, it nevertheless suggests an etymological linking between the name ""Yhwh"" and an earlier form of the Hebrew verbal root h-y-h""to be."" On that basis many have interpreted the name ""Yhwh"" as a third-person form of the verb meaning ""He causes to be, creates,"" itself perhaps a shortened form of a longer liturgical name such as ""(God who) creates (the heavenly armies)."" Note in this connection the invocation of Israels God as ""Lord(Yhwh) of Hosts"" (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/9/17/45'>1SM 17:45</a>). In any case, out of reverence for Gods proper name, the term Adonai, ""my Lord,"" was later used as a substitute. The word Lord(in small capital letters) indicates that the Hebrew text has the sacred name (Yhwh), the tetragrammaton. The word ""Jehovah"" arose from a false reading of this name as it is written in the current Hebrew text. The Septuagint has egō eimi ho ōn, ""I am the One who is"" (ōnbeing the participle of the verb ""to be""). This can be taken as an assertion of Gods aseity or self-existence, and has been understood as such by the Church, since the time of the Fathers, as a true expression of Gods being, even though it is not precisely the meaning of the Hebrew."

NABRE,2,4,17,[4] This staff: probably the same as that of vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/4/2'>2-4</a>; but some understand that a new staff is now given by God to Moses.
NABRE,2,4,18,"[5] Jethro: the Hebrew text has ""Jether,"" apparently a variant form of ""Jethro"" found in the same verse. To see whether they are still living: Moses did not tell his father-in-law his main reason for returning to Egypt."
NABRE,2,4,21,"[6] Harden his heart: in the biblical view, the heart, whose actual function in the circulation of blood was unknown, typically performs functions associated today more with the brain than with the emotions. Therefore, while it may be used in connection with various emotional states ranging from joy to sadness, it very commonly designates the seat of intellectual and volitional activities. For God to harden Pharaohs heart is to harden his resolve against the Israelites desire to leave. In the ancient world, actions which are out of character are routinely attributed not to the person but to some ""outside"" superhuman power acting upon the person (<a href='/NABRE/7/14/16'>JUG 14:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/16/10'>1SM 16:10</a>). Uncharacteristically negative actions or states are explained in the same way (<a href='/NABRE/9/16/14'>1SM 16:14</a>). In this instance, the opposition of Pharaoh, in the face of Gods displays of power, would be unintelligible to the ancient Israelites unless he is seen as under some divine constraint. But this does not diminish Pharaohs own responsibility. In the anthropology of the ancient Israelites there is no opposition between individual responsibility and Gods sovereignty over all of creation. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/9/17'>ROM 9:17-18</a>."
NABRE,2,4,24,"[7] 4:24-26 This story continues to perplex commentators and may have circulated in various forms before finding its place here in Exodus. Particularly troublesome is the unique phrase ""spouse of blood."" Nevertheless, v. <a href='/NABRE/2/4/26'>26</a>, which apparently comes from the hand of a later commentator on the original story, is intended to offer some clarification. It asserts that when Zipporah used the problematic expression (addressing it either to Moses or her son), she did so with reference to the circumcision performed on her son—the only place in the Bible where this rite is performed by a woman. Whatever the precise meaning of the phrase ""spouse of blood,"" circumcision is the key to understanding it as well as the entire incident. One may conclude, therefore, that God was angry with Moses for having failed to keep the divine command given to Abraham in <a href='/NABRE/1/17/10'>GEN 17:10-12</a> and circumcise his son. Moses life is spared when his wife circumcises their son."
NABRE,2,4,25,[8] Touching his feet: a euphemism most probably for the male sexual organ (see <a href='/NABRE/12/18/27'>2KG 18:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/7/20'>ISA 7:20</a>); whether the genitals of the child (after Zipporah circumcised him) or of Moses (after the circumcision of his son) is not clear.

It is used especially of three major feasts: Unleavened Bread, Pentecost (in <a href='/NABRE/2/23/16'>23:16</a>, ""the Feast of Harvest,"" but customarily ""the Feast of Weeks"" [Shavuot]), and Succoth/Sukkoth (in <a href='/NABRE/2/34/16'>34:16</a>, ""the Feast of Ingathering,"" but more frequently ""of Booths, or Tabernacles,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/5/16/13'>DEU 16:13, 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/31/10'>31:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/34'>LEV 23:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/14/16'>ZEC 14:16</a>; passim) and—along with the related noun hag—the Passover in <a href='/NABRE/2/12/14'>12:14</a>.

NABRE,2,5,7,[5] Straw was mixed with clay to give sun-dried bricks greater cohesion and durability.
NABRE,2,5,10,"[6] Thus says Pharaoh: the standard formula for prophetic oracles, but with Pharaoh rather than the Lord as the subject. This heightens the sense of personal conflict between Pharaoh, who acts as if he were God, and the Lord, whose claims are spurned by Pharaoh."
NABRE,2,5,15,"[7] Cried out to Pharaoh: the Hebrew verb translated ""cry out"" and its related noun are normally used of appeals to God by Moses (<a href='/NABRE/2/8/8'>8:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/14/15'>14:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/15/25'>15:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/17/4'>17:4</a>), the people (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/7'>3:7, 9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/14/10'>14:10</a>), or an oppressed individual (<a href='/NABRE/2/22/22'>22:22, 26</a>). Here, by implication, these minor Israelite officials appeal to Pharaoh as if he were their God. See v. <a href='/NABRE/2/5/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,2,6,1,"[1] By a strong hand: by Gods hand or Pharaohs hand? The Hebrew is ambiguous; although it may be an allusion to Gods hand of <a href='/NABRE/2/3/19'>3:19-20</a>, both interpretations are possible."
NABRE,2,6,2,"[2] 6:2-7:7 According to the standard source criticism of the Pentateuch, 6:2-7:7 represents a Priestly version of the JE call narrative in <a href='/NABRE/2/3/1'>3:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/4/17'>4:17</a>.

NABRE,2,6,3,"[3] God the Almighty: in Hebrew, El Shaddai. This traditional translation does not have a firm philological basis. But by my name…I did not make myself known to them: although the text implies that the name Lordwas unknown previously, in context the emphasis in the passage falls on the understanding of God that comes with knowledge of the name. In this way God responds to the worsening plight of the Israelites and Moses complaint in <a href='/NABRE/2/5/23'>5:23</a> that God has done nothing at all to rescue them."

NABRE,2,7,1,"[1] Prophet: Hebrew nabi, one who can legitimately speak for God and in Gods name to another or others. Just as God spoke to Moses, so Moses will speak to Aaron, who will be a ""prophet"" to Pharaoh. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/4/16'>4:16</a>."
NABRE,2,7,13,"[2] 7:14-12:30 After a brief preface (vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/7/8'>8-13</a>) drawn from the Priestly source, a narrative depicting the series of ten disasters that God brings upon Pharaoh because of his stubbornness ensues. Although most of these disasters, known traditionally as the ""ten plagues of Egypt,"" could be interpreted as naturally occurring phenomena, they are clearly represented by the biblical authors as extraordinary events indicative of Gods intervention on behalf of Israel and as occurring exactly according to Moses commands. See <a href='/NABRE/19/78/43'>PS 78:43-51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/105/27'>105:27-36</a> for poetic versions of these plagues, which also differ significantly from the account here."

NABRE,2,7,22,"[5] The Egyptian magicians did the same: this is an exaggeration, presumably influenced by the similar statement in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/7/11'>11</a>; whereas the magicians could turn their staffs into snakes after Aaron had done so, after Aarons sign there should not have been any water in Egypt still unchanged to blood for the magicians ""to do the same"" with it (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/2/7/24'>24</a>)."

NABRE,2,10,26,"[6] Service: as is obvious from v. <a href='/NABRE/2/10/25'>25</a>, the service in question here is the offering of sacrifice. The continued use of the verb bd""to serve"" and related nouns for both the peoples bondage in Egypt and their subsequent service to the Lord dramatizes the point of the conflict between Pharaoh and the God of Israel, who demands from the Israelites an attachment which is exclusive.

NABRE,2,12,15,"[4] Cut off: a common Priestly term, not easily reduced to a simple English equivalent, since its usage appears to involve a number of associated punishments, some or all of which may come into play in any instance of the terms use. These included the excommunication of the offender from the Israelite community, the premature death of the offender, the eventual eradication of the offenders posterity, and finally the loss by the offender of all ancestral holdings."
NABRE,2,12,22,[5] Hyssop: a plant with many small woody branches that was convenient for a sprinkling rite.
NABRE,2,12,32,"[6] Bless me, too: in a final and humiliating admission of defeat, once again Pharaoh asks Moses to intercede for him (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/8/24'>8:24</a>). However, Pharaoh may be speaking sarcastically."

NABRE,2,12,46,"[9] You shall not break any of its bones: the application of these words to Jesus on the cross (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/36'>JHN 19:36</a>) sees the Paschal lamb as a prophetic type of Christ, sacrificed to free men and women from the bondage of sin. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/46/5/7'>1CO 5:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/1/19'>1PE 1:19</a>."
NABRE,2,12,49,"[10] One law: the first appearance of the word torah, traditionally translated as ""law,"" though it can have the broader meaning of ""teaching"" or ""instruction."" Elsewhere, too, it is said that the ""alien"" is to be accorded the same treatment as the Israelite (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/3/19/34'>LEV 19:34</a>)."
NABRE,2,13,4,"[1] Abib: lit., ""ear (of grain),"" the old Canaanite name for this month; Israel later called it ""Nisan."" It was the first month in their liturgical calendar (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/12/2'>EXO 12:2</a>)."
NABRE,2,13,5,"[2] The following service: the celebration of the feast of Unleavened Bread now constitutes the Israelites service, in contrast to the ""service"" they performed for Pharaoh as his slaves."
NABRE,2,13,9,"[3] Sign: while here observance of the feast of Unleavened Bread is likened only metaphorically to a physical sign of ones piety that can be worn as a kind of badge in commemoration of the exodus, from ancient times Jews have seen in this verse also the basis for the wearing of phylacteries. These are small receptacles for copies of biblical verses which Jewish men bind to the arms and forehead as a kind of mnemonic device for the observance of the Law."
NABRE,2,13,17,"[4] By way of the Philistines land: the most direct route from Egypt to Palestine, along the shore of the Mediterranean."
NABRE,2,13,21,"[5] A column of cloud…a column of fire: probably one and the same extraordinary phenomenon, a central nucleus of fire surrounded by smoke; only at night was its luminous nature visible; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/40/38'>40:38</a>."
NABRE,2,14,2,"[1] Pi-hahiroth…Migdol…Baal-zephon: these places have not been definitively identified. Even the relative position of Pi-hahiroth and Baal-zephon is not clear; perhaps the former was on the west shore of the sea, where the Israelites were, and the latter on the opposite shore."
NABRE,2,14,7,"[2] Officers: cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/9/22'>1KG 9:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/23/15'>EZE 23:15</a>. The Hebrew word shalish, rendered in <a href='/NABRE/11/9/22'>1KG 9:22</a> as ""adjutant,"" has yet to have its meaning convincingly established. Given the very possible etymological connection with the number ""three,"" others suggest the translation ""three-man crew"" or, less likely, the ""third man in the chariot"" although Egyptian chariots carried two-man crews. The author of the text may have been describing the chariots of his experience without direct historical knowledge of Egyptian ways."
NABRE,2,14,9,"[3] Horsemen: the usage here may be anachronistic, since horsemen, or cavalry, play a part in warfare only at the end of the second millennium B.C."
NABRE,2,14,19,"[4] Angel of God: Hebrew malak haelohim(Septuagint ho angelos tou theou) here refers not to an independent spiritual being but to Gods power at work in the world; corresponding to the column of cloud/fire, the expression more clearly preserves a sense of distance between God and Gods creatures. The two halves of the verse are parallel and may come from different narrative sources."
NABRE,2,14,20,"[5] The reading of the Hebrew text here is uncertain. The image is of a darkly glowing storm cloud, ominously bright, keeping the two camps apart."
NABRE,2,15,1,"[1] 15:1-21 This poem, regarded by many scholars as one of the oldest compositions in the Bible, was once an independent work. It has been inserted at this important juncture in the large narrative of Exodus to celebrate Gods saving power, having miraculously delivered the people from their enemies, and ultimately leading them to the promised land. Although the victory it describes over the Egyptians at the sea bears a superficial resemblance in v. <a href='/NABRE/2/15/8'>8</a> to the preceding depiction of the water standing like a wall (<a href='/NABRE/2/14/22'>14:22</a>), the poem (as opposed to the following prose verse, v. <a href='/NABRE/2/15/19'>19</a>) suggests a different version of the victory at sea than that found in chap. <a href='/NABRE/2/14/1'>14</a>. There is no splitting of the sea in an act reminiscent of the Lords combat at creation with the sea monsters Rahab and Leviathan (<a href='/NABRE/18/9/13'>JOB 9:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/26/12'>26:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/74/13'>PS 74:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/11'>89:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>ISA 51:9-10</a>); nor is there mention of an east wind driving the waters back so that the Israelites can cross. In this version it is by means of a storm at sea, caused by a ferocious blast from his nostrils, that the Lord achieves a decisive victory against Pharaoh and his army (vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/15/1'>1-12</a>). The second half of the poem (vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/15/13'>13-18</a>) describes Gods guidance into the promised land."
NABRE,2,15,4,"[2] Red Sea: the traditional translation of the Hebrew yam suph, which actually means ""Sea of Reeds"" or ""reedy sea."" The location is uncertain, though in view of the route taken by the Israelites from Egypt to Sinai, it could not have been the Red Sea, which is too far south. It was probably a smaller body of water south of the Gulf of Suez. The term occurs also in Exodus at <a href='/NABRE/2/10/19'>10:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/13/18'>13:18</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/2/23/31'>23:31</a>."
NABRE,2,15,13,"[3] Love: the very important Hebrew term hesedcarries a variety of nuances depending on context: love, kindness, faithfulness. It is often rendered ""steadfast love."" It implies a relationship that generates an obligation and therefore is at home in a covenant context. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/6'>20:6</a>."
NABRE,2,15,16,"[4] Passed over: an allusion to the crossing of the Jordan River (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/3/1'>JOS 3</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/5/1'>5</a>), written as if the entry into the promised land had already occurred. This verse suggests that at one time there was a ritual enactment of the conquest at a shrine near the Jordan River which included also a celebration of the victory at the sea."
NABRE,2,15,21,[5] She responded: Miriams refrain echoes the first verse of this song and was probably sung as an antiphon after each verse.

NABRE,2,16,1,"[1] On the fifteenth day of the second month: just one full month after their departure from Egypt. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/12/2'>12:2, 51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/33/3'>NUM 33:3-4</a>. The Septuagint takes the date to be the beginning of the Israelites grumbling."
NABRE,2,16,4,"[2] Bread from heaven: as a gift from God, the manna is said to come down from the sky. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/78/24'>PS 78:24-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/16/20'>WIS 16:20</a>. Perhaps it was similar to a natural substance that is still found in small quantities on the Sinai peninsula—probably the honey-like resin from the tamarisk tree—but here it is, at least in part, clearly an extraordinary sign of Gods providence. With reference to <a href='/NABRE/43/6/32'>JHN 6:32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/6/49'>49-52</a>, the Christian tradition has regarded the manna as a type of the Eucharist. Test: as the text stands, it seems to leave open the question whether the test concerns trusting in God to provide them with the daily gift of food or observing the sabbath instructions."
NABRE,2,16,15,"[3] What is this: the Hebrew man huis thus rendered by the ancient versions, which understood the phrase as a popular etymology of the Hebrew word man, ""manna""; but some render man hu, ""This is manna."""

NABRE,2,17,15,"[3] Yahweh-nissi: meaning, ""the Lord is my banner."""
NABRE,2,17,16,"[4] Take up the banner of the Lord: lit., ""a hand on the Lords banner,"" apparently a war cry for the Israelite troops in the conduct of Holy War; however, the Hebrew text is difficult to interpret."
NABRE,2,18,2,[1] Moses had sent her back: a later gloss which attempts to harmonize Zipporahs presence with Jethro here in this story and the account of Moses return to Egypt with Zipporah in <a href='/NABRE/2/4/20'>4:20</a>.
NABRE,2,18,5,"[2] The allusion to meeting Moses encamped at the mountain of God, prior to the arrival of the Israelites at Sinai in chap. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/1'>19</a>, might well suggest a different narrative context for this story from an earlier stage of the biblical traditions development. It is noteworthy that immediately after the Sinai pericope (<a href='/NABRE/2/19/1'>EXO 19:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/4/10/28'>NUM 10:28</a>), recounting the theophany at Sinai and the giving of the law, the narrative of Israels march through the wilderness resumes with an apparent doublet of the visit by Moses father-in-law (<a href='/NABRE/4/10/29'>NUM 10:29-32</a>)."
NABRE,2,18,12,"[3] That a non-Israelite, such as Jethro, should bless Israels God by way of acknowledging what God had done for Israel (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/18/10'>10</a>) is not entirely surprising; but the Midianite priests sacrifice to the God of Israel, including his presiding over a sacrificial meal with Aaron and the elders of Israel, is unusual, suggesting that he was himself already a worshiper of Yhwh, Israels God. Note further in this connection the role Jethro takes in the following narrative (vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/18/13'>13-27</a>) in instituting a permanent judiciary for the Israelites. Burnt offering: a sacrifice wholly burnt up as an offering to God."
NABRE,2,18,19,"[4] 18:19-20 By emphasizing Moses mediatorial role for the people before God in regard to Gods statutes and instructions, this story about the institution of Israels judiciary prepares for Moses role in the upcoming revelation of the law at Sinai."
NABRE,2,18,23,"[5] And God so commands you: i.e., and God approves."
NABRE,2,19,2,"[1] Apparently from a different source (P) than v. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/1'>1</a>, which notes the date, v. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/2'>2</a> from the J source includes a second notice of the arrival in the wilderness of Sinai. The Israelites now will be camped at Sinai from this point on all the way to <a href='/NABRE/4/10/10'>NUM 10:10</a>. This is a striking indication of the centrality and importance of the Sinai narrative in the overall composition of the Pentateuch."
NABRE,2,19,5,"[2] Covenant: while covenants between individuals and between nations are ubiquitous in the ancient Near East, the adaptation of this concept to express the relationship that will henceforth characterize Gods relationship to Israel represents an important innovation of biblical faith. Other gods might ""choose"" nations to fulfill a special destiny or role in the world; but only Israels God is bound to a people by covenant. Thereby Israels identity as a people is put upon a foundation that does not depend upon the vicissitudes of Israelite statehood or the normal trappings of national existence. Israel will be a covenant people."
NABRE,2,19,6,"[3] Kingdom of priests: inasmuch as this phrase is parallel to ""holy nation,"" it most likely means that the whole Israelite nation is set apart from other nations and so consecrated to God, or holy, in the way priests are among the people (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/61/6'>ISA 61:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/2/5'>1PE 2:5, 9</a>)."
NABRE,2,19,13,"[4] May they go up on the mountain: in vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/12'>12-13</a>a, a later Priestly reshaping of an earlier version of the instructions governing how the people are to prepare for the encounter with God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/10'>10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/19/13'>13</a>b), the people are to be restrained from ascending the mountain, which is suffused with the holiness of God and too dangerous for their approach. In the earlier version, as v. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/13'>13b</a> suggests, the sanctified people must come near, in order to hear God speaking with Moses (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/9'>9</a>) and in this way receive confirmation of his special relationship with God."
NABRE,2,19,16,[5] Shofar: a rams horn used like a trumpet for signaling both for liturgical and military purposes.
NABRE,2,19,20,"[6] 19:20-25 At this point the Priestly additions of vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/12'>12-13</a>a are elaborated with further Priestly instructions, which include the priests sanctifying themselves apart from the people (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/22'>22</a>) and Aaron accompanying Moses to the top of the mountain (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/24'>24</a>)."
NABRE,2,20,1,"[1] 20:1-17 The precise numbering and division of these precepts into ""ten commandments"" is somewhat uncertain. Traditionally among Catholics and Lutherans vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/1'>1-6</a> are considered as only one commandment, and v. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/17'>17</a> as two. The Anglican, Greek Orthodox, and Reformed churches count vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/1'>1-6</a> as two, and v. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/17'>17</a> as one. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/5/6'>DEU 5:6-21</a>. The traditional designation as ""ten"" is not found here but in <a href='/NABRE/2/34/28'>34:28</a> (and also <a href='/NABRE/5/4/13'>DEU 4:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/10/4'>10:4</a>), where these precepts are alluded to literally as ""the ten words."" That they were originally written on two tablets appears in <a href='/NABRE/2/32/15'>EXO 32:15-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/28'>34:28-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/13'>DEU 4:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/10/2'>10:2-4</a>. The present form of the commands is a product of a long development, as is clear from the fact that the individual precepts vary considerably in length and from the slightly different formulation of <a href='/NABRE/5/5/6'>DEU 5:6-21</a> (see especially vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/12'>12-15</a> and <a href='/NABRE/2/20/21'>21</a>). Indeed they represent a mature formulation of a traditional morality. Why this specific selection of commands should be set apart is not entirely clear. None of them is unique in the Old Testament and all of the laws which follow are also from God and equally binding on the Israelites. Even so, this collection represents a privileged expression of Gods moral demands on Israel and is here set apart from the others as a direct, unmediated communication of God to the Israelites and the basis of the covenant being concluded on Sinai."
NABRE,2,20,3,"[2] Beside me: this commandment is traditionally understood as an outright denial of the existence of other gods except the God of Israel; however, in the context of the more general prohibitions in vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/4'>4-5</a>, v. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/3'>3</a> is, more precisely, Gods demand for Israels exclusive worship and allegiance. The Hebrew phrase underlying the translation ""beside me"" is, nonetheless, problematic and has been variously translated, e.g., ""except me,"" ""in addition to me,"" ""in preference to me,"" ""in defiance of me,"" and ""in front of me"" or ""before my face."" The latter translation, with its concrete, spatial nuances, has suggested to some that the prohibition once sought to exclude from the Lords sanctuary the cult images or idols of other gods, such as the asherah, or stylized sacred tree of life, associated with the Canaanite goddess Asherah (<a href='/NABRE/2/34/13'>34:13</a>). Over the course of time, as vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/4'>4-5</a> suggest, the original scope of v. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/3'>3</a> was expanded."
NABRE,2,20,4,"[3] Or a likeness of anything: compare this formulation to that found in <a href='/NABRE/5/5/8'>DEU 5:8</a>, which understands this phrase and the following phrases as specifications of the prohibited idol (Hebrew pesel), which usually refers to an image that is carved or hewn rather than cast."
NABRE,2,20,5,"[4] Jealous: demanding exclusive allegiance. Inflicting punishment…the third and fourth generation: the intended emphasis is on Gods mercy by the contrast between punishment and mercy (""to the thousandth generation""—v. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/6'>6</a>). Other Old Testament texts repudiate the idea of punishment devolving on later generations (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/24/16'>DEU 24:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/31/29'>JER 31:29-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/18/2'>EZE 18:2-4</a>). Yet it is known that later generations may suffer the punishing effects of sins of earlier generations, but not the guilt."
NABRE,2,20,7,"[5] In vain: i.e., to no good purpose, a general framing of the prohibition which includes swearing falsely, especially in the context of a legal proceeding, but also goes beyond it (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/24/16'>LEV 24:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/30/8'>PRO 30:8-9</a>)."
NABRE,2,20,8,"[6] Keep it holy: i.e., to set it apart from the other days of the week, in part, as the following verse explains, by not doing work that is ordinarily done in the course of a week. The special importance of this command can be seen in the fact that, together with vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/9'>9-11</a>, it represents the longest of the Decalogues precepts."
NABRE,2,20,11,"[7] Here, in a formulation which reflects Priestly theology, the veneration of the sabbath is grounded in Gods own hallowing of the sabbath in creation. Compare <a href='/NABRE/2/31/13'>31:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/5/15'>DEU 5:15</a>."
NABRE,2,20,12,"[8] 20:12-17 The Decalogue falls into two parts: the preceding precepts refer to God, the following refer primarily to ones fellow Israelites."
NABRE,2,20,13,"[9] Kill: as frequent instances of killing in the context of war or certain crimes (see vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/12'>12-18</a>) demonstrate in the Old Testament, not all killing comes within the scope of the commandment. For this reason, the Hebrew verb translated here as ""kill"" is often understood as ""murder,"" although it is in fact used in the Old Testament at times for unintentional acts of killing (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/5/4/41'>DEU 4:41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/20/3'>JOS 20:3</a>) and for legally sanctioned killing (<a href='/NABRE/4/35/30'>NUM 35:30</a>). The term may originally have designated any killing of another Israelite, including acts of manslaughter, for which the victims kin could exact vengeance. In the present context, it denotes the killing of one Israelite by another, motivated by hatred or the like (<a href='/NABRE/4/35/20'>NUM 35:20</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/6/9'>HOS 6:9</a>)."
NABRE,2,20,22,"[10] 20:22-23:33 This collection consists of the civil and religious laws, both apodictic (absolute) and casuistic (conditional), which were given to the people through the mediation of Moses. They will be written down by Moses in <a href='/NABRE/2/24/4'>24:4</a>."
NABRE,2,20,24,"[11] Where I cause my name to be invoked: i.e., at the sacred site where God wishes to be worshiped. <a href='/NABRE/5/12/1'>DEU 12</a> will demand the centralization of all sacrificial worship in one place chosen by God."
NABRE,2,21,1,"[1] Ordinances: judicial precedents to be used in settling questions of law and custom. More than half of the civil and religious laws in this collection (<a href='/NABRE/2/20/22'>20:22</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/23/33'>23:33</a>), designated in <a href='/NABRE/2/24/7'>24:7</a> as ""the book of the covenant,"" have parallels in the cuneiform laws of the ancient Near East. It is clear that Israel participated in a common legal culture with its neighbors."
NABRE,2,21,2,"[2] Slave: an Israelite could become a slave of another Israelite as a means of paying a debt, or an Israelite could be born into slavery due to a parents status as a slave. Here a time limit is prescribed for such slavery; other stipulations (vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/21/20'>20-21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/21/26'>26-27</a>) tried to reduce the evils of slavery, but slavery itself is not condemned in the Old Testament."
NABRE,2,21,6,"[3] To God: the ritual of the piercing of the slaves ear, which signified a lifetime commitment to the master, probably took place at the door of the household, where God as protector of the household was called upon as a witness. Another possible location for the ritual would have been the door of the sanctuary, where God or judges would have witnessed the slaves promise of lifetime obedience to his master."
NABRE,2,21,8,[4] Designated her: intended her as a wife of second rank.
NABRE,2,21,12,"[5] 21:12-14 Unintentional homicide is to be punished differently from premeditated, deliberate murder. One who kills unintentionally can seek asylum by grasping the horns of the altar at the local sanctuary. In later Israelite history, when worship was centralized in Jerusalem, cities throughout the realm were designated as places of refuge. Apparently the leaders of the local community were to determine whether or not the homicide was intentional."
NABRE,2,21,15,"[6] The verb used most often signifies a violent, sometimes deadly, attack. The severe penalty assigned is intended to safeguard the integrity of the family."
NABRE,2,21,17,"[7] Curses: not merely an angrily uttered expletive at ones parents, but a solemn juridical formula of justifiable retribution which was considered to be legally binding and guaranteed by God."
NABRE,2,21,22,"[8] 21:22-25 This law of talion is applied here in the specific case of a pregnant woman who, as an innocent bystander, is injured by two fighting men. The law of talion is not held up as a general principle to be applied throughout the book of the covenant. (But see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/24/19'>LEV 24:19-20</a>.) Here this principle of rigorous accountability aimed to prevent injury to a woman about to give birth by apparently requiring the assailant to have his own wife injured as she was about to bring new life into his family. However, it is debatable whether talion was ever understood or applied literally in Israel. In his Sermon on the Mount, Jesus challenges his audience to find a deeper form of justice than the supposed equilibrium offered by talion (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/38'>MAT 5:38-40</a>)."
NABRE,2,21,30,[9] Ransom: the amount of money or material goods required to restore the relationship between the relatives of the victim and the negligent owner of the goring ox.
NABRE,2,22,1,"[1] 22:1-2 If a thief is caught: this seems to be a fragment of what was once a longer law on housebreaking, which has been inserted here into the middle of a law on stealing animals. At night the householder would be justified in killing a burglar outright, but not so in the daytime, when the burglar could more easily be caught alive. He must make full restitution: this stood originally immediately after <a href='/NABRE/2/21/37'>21:37</a>."
NABRE,2,22,7,"[2] Brought to God: either within the household or at the sanctuary, the owner of the house is required to take an oath before God."
NABRE,2,22,16,[3] The bride price for virgins: fifty shekels according to <a href='/NABRE/5/22/29'>DEU 22:29</a>.
NABRE,2,22,27,[4] Despise God: a turning away from Gods authority and so failing to honor God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/30'>1SM 2:30</a>).
NABRE,2,23,14,"[1] These three feasts—Passover/Unleavened Bread, Weeks (Pentecost), and Booths (Tabernacles or Succoth/Sukkoth)—are also listed in <a href='/NABRE/2/34/18'>34:18-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/1'>LEV 23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/1'>DEU 16</a>."
NABRE,2,23,15,"[2] Appear before me: the original expression was ""see my face""; so also in several other places, as <a href='/NABRE/2/23/17'>23:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/23'>34:23-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/16'>DEU 16:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/31/11'>31:11</a>."
NABRE,2,23,19,"[3] Boil a young goat in its mothers milk: this command, repeated in <a href='/NABRE/2/34/26'>34:26</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/14/21'>DEU 14:21</a>, is difficult to understand. It may originate from a taboo that forbade killing the young that were still nursing from the mother, or that forbade the mixing of life and death: the slaughtered young goat with the milk that previously had nourished its life. The Jewish dietary custom of keeping meat and dairy products separate is based on this command."
NABRE,2,23,21,"[4] My authority is within him: lit., ""My name is within him."""
NABRE,2,23,24,"[5] Sacred stones: objects that symbolized the presence of Canaanite deities. In general, standing stones served as memorials for deities, persons, or significant events such as military victories or covenant-making. See <a href='/NABRE/2/24/4'>24:4</a>."
NABRE,2,23,28,"[6] Hornets: the Hebrew sirahis a disputed term, but according to ancient interpreters it refers to hornets that were unleashed against the enemy to sting them and cause panic (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/7/20'>DEU 7:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/24/12'>JOS 24:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/12/8'>WIS 12:8</a>). Others associate the word with plagues or troublesome afflictions."
NABRE,2,23,31,[7] The sea of the Philistines: the Mediterranean. Only in the time of David and Solomon did the territory of Israel come near to reaching such distant borders.
NABRE,2,24,4,"[1] Sacred stones: stone shafts or slabs, erected as symbols of the fact that each of the twelve tribes had entered into this covenant with God; see <a href='/NABRE/2/23/24'>23:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/28/18'>GEN 28:18</a>."
NABRE,2,24,11,[2] They saw God: the ancients thought that the sight of God would bring instantaneous death. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/33/20'>33:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/16/13'>GEN 16:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/32/31'>32:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/6/22'>JUG 6:22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/13/22'>13:22</a>. Ate and drank: partook of the sacrificial meal.
NABRE,2,25,5,[1] Tahash: perhaps a kind of specially finished leather. The Greek and Latin versions took it for the color hyacinth.
NABRE,2,25,10,"[2] Cubits: the distance between the elbow and tip of the middle finger of an average-size person, about eighteen inches. The dimensions of the ark of the covenant were approximately 3 3/4 feet long, 2 1/4 feet wide, and 2 1/4 feet high."
NABRE,2,25,17,"[3] Cover: the Hebrew term, kapporet, has been connected with kippur, as in the feast of Yom Kippur or Day of Atonement (<a href='/NABRE/3/16/1'>LEV 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/26'>23:26-32</a>): hence, influenced by the Greek and Latin versions, and Luthers German, English translations have rendered it ""propitiatory,"" ""mercy seat,"" and the like."
NABRE,2,25,18,"[4] 25:18-20 Cherubim: probably in the form of human-headed winged lions. The cherubim over the ark formed the throne for the invisible Lord. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/80/2'>PS 80:2</a>. For a more detailed description of the somewhat different cherubim in the Temple of Solomon, see <a href='/NABRE/11/6/23'>1KG 6:23-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/3/10'>2CH 3:10-13</a>."
NABRE,2,25,25,[5] A frame: probably placed near the bottom of the legs to keep them steady. The golden table of Herods Temple is pictured thus on the Arch of Titus.
NABRE,2,25,29,"[6] 25:29-30 The plates held the showbread, that is, the holy bread which was placed upon the table every sabbath as an offering to God, and was later eaten by the priests. The cups held the incense which was strewn upon the bread. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/24/5'>LEV 24:5-9</a>. The libation wine was poured from the pitchers into the bowls. All these vessels were kept on the golden table."
NABRE,2,25,31,[7] Menorah: this traditional lampstand is still used today in Jewish liturgy.
NABRE,2,25,33,"[8] In keeping with the arrangement of the ornaments on the shaft, the three sets of ornaments on each branch were probably so placed that one was at the top and the other two equally spaced along the length of the branch. Knob: the cup-shaped seed capsule at the base of a flower."
NABRE,2,25,34,"[9] 25:34-35 Of the four ornaments on the shaft, one was at the top and one was below each of the three sets of side branches."
NABRE,2,25,37,"[10] The lamps were probably shaped like small boats, with the wick at one end; the end with the wick was turned toward the front of the menorah."
NABRE,2,25,38,[11] Trays: small receptacles for the burnt-out wicks.
NABRE,2,25,39,"[12] Talent: Heb. kikkar. The largest unit of weight used in the Bible, equivalent to 3,000 shekels (see <a href='/NABRE/2/38/24'>38:24</a>). It is difficult to be precise about biblical weights; the Israelite talent may have weighed between 75-80 pounds."
NABRE,2,26,1,"[1] Sheets: strips of tapestry, woven of white linen, the colored threads being used for the cherubim which were embroidered on them. These sheets were stretched across the top of the tabernacle to form a roof, their free ends hanging down inside the framework that formed the walls."
NABRE,2,26,7,[2] Tent: the cloth made of sheets of goat hair to cover the tabernacle.
NABRE,2,26,9,"[3] Half the width of the end strip was folded back at the front of the tabernacle, thus leaving another half-strip to hang down at the rear. Cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/2/26/12'>12</a>."
NABRE,2,26,17,"[4] Arms: lit., ""hands."" According to some, they served as ""tongue and groove"" to mortise the structural elements; according to others, they were pegs that fitted into sockets in the pedestals."
NABRE,2,26,32,"[5] Hooks: probably placed near the tops of the columns, to hold the rope from which the veils and curtains hung."
NABRE,2,26,36,[6] Variegated: without definite designs such as the cherubim on the inner veil.
NABRE,2,27,2,"[1] Horns: the horn of a ram, goat or ox is a common Old Testament figure for strength and dignity; they represent the divine character of the altar itself or the deity worshiped there."
NABRE,2,27,4,"[2] Grating: it is not clear whether this was flush with the altar or at some small distance from it; in the latter case the space between the altar and the grating would be filled with stones and serve as a platform around the altar, which would otherwise be too high for the priest to reach conveniently."
NABRE,2,27,8,[3] Hollow: probably filled with earth or stones when in use. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/24'>20:24-25</a>.
NABRE,2,28,3,"[1] Artisans…endowed with skill: lit., ""wise of heart,"" and ""filled with a spirit of wisdom."" In Hebrew wisdom includes practical skills. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/35/35'>35:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/36/1'>36:1-2</a>."
NABRE,2,28,6,"[2] Ephod: this Hebrew word is retained in the translation because it is the technical term for a peculiar piece of the priestly vestments, the exact nature of which is uncertain. It seems to have been a sort of apron that hung from the shoulders of the priest by shoulder straps (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/7'>7</a>) and was tied around his waist by the loose ends of the attached belt (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/8'>8</a>)."
NABRE,2,28,15,"[3] 28:15-30 Breastpiece: an approximately nine-inch square, pocketlike receptacle for holding the Urim and Thummim (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/30'>30</a>). It formed an integral part of the ephod, to which it was attached by an elaborate system of rings and chains. Both the ephod and its breastpiece were made of brocaded linen. Span: Heb. zeret, the distance between the top of the little finger and the thumb; one half a cubit, approximately nine inches."
NABRE,2,28,17,[4] 28:17-20 The translation of the Hebrew names of some of these gems is quite conjectural.
NABRE,2,28,30,"[5] Urim and Thummim: both the meaning of these Hebrew words and the exact nature of the objects so designated are uncertain. They were apparently lots of some kind which were drawn or cast by the priest to ascertain Gods decision on particular questions. Hence, the pocket in which they were kept was called ""the breastpiece of decision."""
NABRE,2,28,41,"[6] Install them: lit., ""fill their hands,"" a technical expression used for the installation of priests."
NABRE,2,29,22,[1] Fatty tail: the thick layer of fat surrounding the tails of sheep and rams bred in the Middle East. It is regarded as a choice food. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/3/9'>LEV 3:9</a>.
NABRE,2,29,24,"[2] 29:24-26 Elevated offering: the portions of a communion offering, brisket and right thigh, which the officiating priest raised in the presence of the Lord. They were reserved for Aaron and his sons."
NABRE,2,29,27,[3] 29:27-30 These verses are a parenthetical interruption of the installation ritual; v. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/31'>31</a> belongs logically immediately after v. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/26'>26</a>.
NABRE,2,29,36,"[4] 29:36-37 Purify the altar: the purpose of the purification offering here is to cleanse, or purify, the newly constructed altar of any defilement resulting from presumably minor and inadvertent sins, but the text is not explicit about what the offenses were or who committed them. So various theories have been proposed to explain the cause of the altars contamination. Note, however, that the offering appears to be demanded of Aaron and his sons; they are the ones who lay hands upon it (v. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/10'>10</a>)."
NABRE,2,29,38,[5] 29:38-42 A parenthesis inserted into the rubrics for consecrating the altar; v. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/43'>43</a> belongs directly after v. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/37'>37</a>.
NABRE,2,29,40,[6] Hin: see note on <a href='/NABRE/26/45/24'>EZE 45:24</a>.
NABRE,2,31,2,"[1] Singled out: lit., ""called by name""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/35/30'>35:30</a>."
NABRE,2,31,10,[2] The service cloths: so the Greek. They were perhaps the colored cloths mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/4/4/4'>NUM 4:4-15</a>.
NABRE,2,31,14,"[3] 31:14-15 For the distinction between work proscribed on certain festivals and weekly Sabbaths, see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/23/3'>LEV 23:3</a>."
NABRE,2,32,4,"[1] 32:4-5 Who brought you…a feast of the Lord: it seems that the golden calf was intended as an image, not of another god, but of the Lord, whose strength was symbolized by the strength of a young bull. The Israelites, however, had been forbidden to represent the Lord under any visible form. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/4'>20:4</a>. In the tenth century Jeroboam made golden calves for the shrines at Bethel and Dan, presumably to function as thrones for the Lord as the ark did in Jerusalem (see <a href='/NABRE/11/12/27'>1KG 12:27-30</a>)."
NABRE,2,32,11,"[2] 32:11-13 Moses uses three arguments to persuade the Lord to remain faithful to the Sinai covenant even though the people have broken it: (1) they are Gods own people, redeemed with Gods great power; (2) Gods reputation will suffer if they are destroyed; (3) the covenant with Abraham still stands. The Lords change of mind is a testimony to Israels belief in the power of intercessory prayer."
NABRE,2,32,20,"[3] The water: according to <a href='/NABRE/5/9/21'>DEU 9:21</a>, this was the stream that flowed down Mount Sinai."
NABRE,2,32,21,"[4] 32:21-24 Aaron attempts to persuade Moses not to act in anger, just as Moses persuaded the Lord. He also shifts the blame from himself to the people."
NABRE,2,32,29,"[5] Installed as priests: lit., ""fill your hands,"" a term for the ordination of priests (see <a href='/NABRE/2/28/41'>28:41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/29/9'>29:9, 29</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/29/33'>33</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/29/35'>35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/3/3'>NUM 3:3</a>). Because of their zeal for the true worship of the Lord, the Levites were chosen to be special ministers of the ritual service."
NABRE,2,32,32,[6] The book that you have written: a symbolic reference to the list of Gods faithful people.
NABRE,2,33,12,"[1] Intimate friend: lit., ""know by name."" The root word meaning ""know"" or ""make known"" appears four times in vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/33/12'>12-13</a>."
NABRE,2,33,14,"[2] I myself: lit., ""my face,"" that is, ""my presence."" The making of the calf (<a href='/NABRE/2/32/1'>32:1-4</a>) is an attempt to control the Lords presence. In response the Lord refuses to accompany the people (<a href='/NABRE/2/33/3'>33:3</a>) until Moses persuades him."
NABRE,2,33,20,"[3] No one can see me and live: reflecting the tradition that to see God meant instant death. This is contradicted by the statements that Hagar (<a href='/NABRE/1/16/13'>GEN 16:13</a>), Jacob (<a href='/NABRE/1/32/31'>GEN 32:31</a>), and Manoah and his wife (<a href='/NABRE/7/13/22'>JUG 13:22</a>) all ""see God"" and yet live (see also <a href='/NABRE/2/24/10'>EXO 24:10-11</a>)."
NABRE,2,34,1,"[1] Words: a common term for commandments, especially the Decalogue (see v. <a href='/NABRE/2/34/28'>28</a>). In v. <a href='/NABRE/2/34/27'>27</a> ""words"" connotes the commands given in vv. <a href='/NABRE/2/34/11'>11-26</a>."
NABRE,2,34,6,[2] Gracious…fidelity: this succinct poetic description of God is an often-repeated statement of belief (see <a href='/NABRE/4/14/18'>NUM 14:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/103/8'>PS 103:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/145/8'>145:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/2/13'>JOE 2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/32/4/2'>JON 4:2</a>). All the terms describe Gods relationship to the covenant people.
NABRE,2,34,10,"[3] Never before done: lit., ""created."" The verb used here (Heb. bara) is predicated only of God (see <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>GEN 1:1, 21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/1/27'>27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/51/12'>PS 51:12</a>). These wonders are a new creation and can be performed only by God."
NABRE,2,34,13,"[4] Asherah was the name of a Canaanite goddess. In her honor wooden poles (asherot) were erected, just as stone pillars (massebot) were erected in honor of the god Baal. Both were placed near the altar in a Canaanite shrine."
NABRE,2,34,14,"[5] Jealous: see note on <a href='/NABRE/2/20/5'>20:5</a>. Some, by a slight emendation, render, ""The Lord is jealous for his name."" Cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/39/25'>EZE 39:25</a>."
NABRE,2,34,22,"[6] Feast of Weeks: the festival of thanksgiving for the harvest, celebrated seven weeks or fifty days after the beginning of the harvest. It was also called Pentecost (fiftieth) and coincided with the giving of the law on Mount Sinai, fifty days after the offering of the first fruits; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/10'>LEV 23:10-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/9'>DEU 16:9</a>. Feast of the Ingathering: feast of Booths."
NABRE,2,34,29,"[7] Radiant: the Hebrew word translated ""radiant"" is spelled like the term for ""horns."" Thus the artistic tradition of portraying Moses with horns."
NABRE,2,38,8,[1] The reflecting surface of ancient mirrors was usually of polished bronze. The women who served: cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/22'>1SM 2:22</a>.
NABRE,2,40,2,[1] On the first day of the first month: almost a year after the departure of the Israelites from Egypt. Cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/2/40/17'>17</a>.
NABRE,3,1,2,"[1] Any one of you: women as well as men bring sacrifices (see <a href='/NABRE/3/12/6'>12:6-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/15/28'>15:28-30</a>) and are explicitly obligated in other ritual matters (e.g., 13:29, 38; <a href='/NABRE/4/5/6'>NUM 5:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/6/2'>6:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/2/24'>LUK 2:24</a>). Thus, though the Hebrew formulates sacrificial and other law with male reference, the translation reflects the inclusion of women in ritual requirements. From the herd or from the flock: the only animals which could be used as sacrificial victims were domestic animals either of the bovine class (bulls, cows and calves) or the ovine class (sheep and lambs, goats and kids). Excluded, therefore, were not only all wild animals, but also such ""unclean"" domestic animals as the camel and the donkey (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>11:1-47</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/27/26'>27:26-27</a>)."
NABRE,3,1,3,[2] 1:3-5 Entrance of the tent of meeting…before the Lord: probably the forecourt from the entrance of the court to the entrance of the tent (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/27/1'>EXO 27</a>). Thus the altar in front of the tent was entirely accessible to the laity.
NABRE,3,1,3,"[3] The burnt offering is used for regular daily (<a href='/NABRE/3/6/1'>6:1-6</a>) offerings, public festivals (<a href='/NABRE/4/28/1'>NUM 28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/4/29/1'>29</a>), purification rituals (<a href='/NABRE/3/12/6'>LEV 12:6-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/14/19'>14:19-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/15/15'>15:15, 30</a>), and individuals vows and voluntary offerings (<a href='/NABRE/3/22/18'>22:18-20</a>)."
NABRE,3,1,4,[4] Lay a hand: the imposition of a single hand for the sacrifices in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/3/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/5/1'>5</a> may be a means of designating the animal as belonging to the offerer. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/16/21'>16:21</a>. Atonement: see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/16/6'>16:6</a>.
NABRE,3,1,5,"[5] Shall then be slaughtered: lit., ""he shall slaughter the bull."" Slaughtering is not something the offerer must do (as opposed to, for example, hand placement [v. <a href='/NABRE/3/1/4'>4</a>] or the presentation of sacrificial portions as an elevated offering [<a href='/NABRE/3/7/29'>7:29-34</a>]). Thus the verb is construed impersonally here."
NABRE,3,1,16,"[6] Crissum: the area around the anus of the bird, lying beneath the birds tail."
NABRE,3,2,1,"[1] Grain offerings are used as independent offerings (those in this chapter and cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/6/12'>6:12-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/8/26'>8:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/10'>23:10-11</a>), as substitutes for other offerings in a case of poverty (<a href='/NABRE/3/5/11'>5:11-13</a>), and as accompaniments to animal offerings (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/15/1'>NUM 15:1-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/28/1'>28:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/4/29/39'>29:39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/14/20'>LEV 14:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/12'>23:12, 18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/23/37'>37</a>). Chapter 2 describes two basic types of grain offering: uncooked (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/2/1'>1-3</a>) and cooked (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/2/4'>4-10</a>). The flour (sōlet) used was made of wheat (<a href='/NABRE/2/29/2'>EXO 29:2</a>) and Jewish tradition and Semitic cognates indicate that it is a coarse rather than a fine flour."
NABRE,3,2,2,"[2] Token of the offering: lit., ""reminder."" Instead of burning the whole grain offering, only this part is burned on the altar."
NABRE,3,2,11,"[3] 2:11-12 No grain offering that is leavened can be offered on the altar. Those in <a href='/NABRE/3/7/13'>7:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/17'>23:17</a> are leavened but not offered on the altar. The Hebrew word for ""honey"" may refer to fruit syrup as well as to bee honey."
NABRE,3,2,13,[4] The salt of the covenant with your God: partaking of salt in common was an ancient symbol of friendship and alliance. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/9/49'>MAK 9:49-50</a> and <a href='/NABRE/51/4/6'>COL 4:6</a>.
NABRE,3,3,1,"[1] The exact meaning of Hebrew shelamim, ""communion sacrifice,"" is not clear. It has also been rendered ""gift,"" ""(re)payment,"" ""peace,"" ""well-being,"" or ""covenant"" offering. This offering may be brought for a vow or voluntary offering (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/22/21'>22:21</a>). A distinct version of the communion sacrifice is the thanksgiving offering (<a href='/NABRE/3/7/11'>7:11-15</a> vis-à-vis vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/3/16'>16-18</a>)."
NABRE,3,3,3,"[2] 3:3-5 Fat: only part of the offering is devoted to God, as opposed to the burnt offering (chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/1/1'>1</a>), which is wholly burnt (except for the skin). The meat is distributed among the offerer (and the offerers party) and the priests (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/7/11'>7:11-36</a>)."
NABRE,3,3,17,"[3] Any fat or any blood: this prohibition is mentioned here because portions of this offering could be eaten by lay Israelites, who may not be entirely familiar with the prohibition (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/7/22'>7:22-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/19/26'>19:26</a>). The fat prohibited is only the visceral fat mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/3/3/9'>3:9-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/3/14'>14-15</a>, not muscular fat."
NABRE,3,4,2,"[1] Inadvertently: the concern in this chapter, and much of chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/5/1'>5</a>, is wrongs done unintentionally. Intentional (""high-handed"") sins are punished with being ""cut off"" from the people (<a href='/NABRE/4/15/30'>NUM 15:30-31</a>). See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/7/20'>LEV 7:20</a>. Lords prohibitions: not included in the faults figured here is failure to perform positive commandments. Failing to perform positive commands, however, still renders the individual liable to other punishment (e.g., failing to observe the Passover, <a href='/NABRE/4/9/13'>NUM 9:13</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/15/22'>NUM 15:22-31</a>."

The offering cleansed the various places to which the blood was applied or the rooms in which it was sprinkled."
NABRE,3,4,5,"[3] 4:5-7 On the structure of the sanctuary, see <a href='/NABRE/2/26/1'>EXO 26</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/27/1'>27</a>."

NABRE,3,4,13,[6] Whole community…errs: this case probably complements that of vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/4/3'>3-12</a>. There the high priest sins so that the people become guilty. Those verses deal with his requirements for atonement; vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/4/13'>13-21</a> deal with the peoples requirements.
NABRE,3,5,1,[1] 5:1-13 This differs from the prescriptions for purification offerings in chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/4/1'>4</a> by listing four specific wrongs for which a purification offering is brought and allowing the substitution of birds and grain offerings in the case of poverty.
NABRE,3,5,2,"[2] Swarming creature: a rather imprecise categorization that includes various small creatures in the seas, such as fish that go about in large groups or swarms (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/20'>GEN 1:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/11/10'>LEV 11:10</a>); or, similarly, various winged insects that mass in the skies (<a href='/NABRE/3/11/20'>LEV 11:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/14/19'>DEU 14:19</a>); and, finally, various small creatures that move in swarms on land, whether crawlers, quadrupeds, or of the multilegged variety (<a href='/NABRE/3/11/41'>LEV 11:41-42</a>). According to <a href='/NABRE/3/11/29'>11:29-30</a>, even various rodents and lizards can be included in this category."
NABRE,3,5,11,[3] Ephah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,3,5,13,"[4] 5:14-26 This last half of the chapter deals with a distinct sacrifice, the reparation offering (Heb. asham). The Hebrew root for this term has a basic meaning of ""be guilty."" The noun can have a consequential sense of ""that which is due from guilt,"" i.e., ""compensation, indemnification, reparation""; hence the translation ""reparation offering,"" rather than the alternatives ""guilt offering"" or ""trespass offering."" This offering is brought most often in cases of sacrilege."
NABRE,3,5,15,"[5] At the established value: the Hebrew term erkĕkā, which in context means ""(established) value,"" may indicate that a person could bring the monetary equivalent of a ram instead of an actual animal. See vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/5/18'>18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/5/25'>25</a>."
NABRE,3,6,2,[1] 6:2-6 This passage may have reference to the burnt offering that is offered in the morning and late afternoon each day (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/38'>EXO 29:38-42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/28/3'>NUM 28:3-8</a>).
NABRE,3,6,2,"[2] Ritual: Hebrew torah, which also has the broader meaning of ""instruction."" The treatment of sacrifices in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/3/6/1'>6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/7/1'>7</a> recapitulates the offerings treated in 1-5 but now with more emphasis on priestly duties and prerogatives."
NABRE,3,6,6,[3] 6:7-11 The passage is apparently concerned with the raw grain offering of <a href='/NABRE/3/2/1'>2:1-3</a>.
NABRE,3,6,11,"[4] 6:12-16 This seems to refer to a grain offering offered twice daily by the high priest, perhaps identical to the regular grain offering in <a href='/NABRE/4/4/16'>NUM 4:16</a> (cf. <a href='/NABRE/16/10/34'>NEH 10:34</a>). This offering is distinct from the grain offering that accompanies the daily burnt offering."
NABRE,3,6,16,"[5] 6:17-23 There are two types of purification offering: one whose blood is used inside the tent sanctuary (<a href='/NABRE/3/4/1'>4:1-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/4/13'>13-21</a>) and another whose blood was only used at the outer sacrificial altar (<a href='/NABRE/3/4/22'>4:22-26</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/4/27'>27-31</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/4/32'>32-35</a>). The carcasses of the former, as well as of purification offerings brought by the priests themselves (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/8/14'>8:14-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/9/8'>9:8-11</a>), are not eaten by priests but disposed of at the ash heap outside the camp, which itself is set up around the sanctuary (<a href='/NABRE/2/29/14'>EXO 29:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/4/11'>LEV 4:11-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/4/21'>21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/6/23'>6:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/8/17'>8:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/9/11'>9:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/16/27'>16:27</a>). The Letter to the Hebrews compares Jesus suffering ""outside the gate"" to the disposal of purification offering carcasses outside the camp (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/11'>HEB 13:11-13</a>)."
NABRE,3,7,1,[1] 7:1-6 These prescriptions may appear here rather than in <a href='/NABRE/3/5/14'>5:14-26</a> where this offering is first treated because the monetary equivalent of the offering might have been brought instead of an actual animal. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/5/15'>5:15</a>.
NABRE,3,7,9,"[2] 7:9-10 For the distinction between uncooked and cooked grain offerings, see <a href='/NABRE/3/2/1'>2:1-10</a> and note on <a href='/NABRE/3/2/1'>2:1</a>. The contradiction between v. <a href='/NABRE/3/7/9'>9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/2/10'>2:10</a> may reflect a development in custom, with the distribution in v. <a href='/NABRE/3/7/9'>9</a> coming from earlier times, when sanctuary personnel was more limited."
NABRE,3,7,10,"[3] 7:11-36 This section discusses three types of communion sacrifice: the thanksgiving offering (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/7/12'>12-15</a>), a votive offering, and a voluntary offering (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/7/16'>16-18</a>). The latter two are similar and are thus mentioned together. Verses 19-36 apply to all types of communion sacrifice."
NABRE,3,7,12,[4] 7:12-13 Four types of breads accompany the thanksgiving offering. Three types are cooked grain offerings comparable to those in <a href='/NABRE/3/2/4'>2:4-10</a>. Also required are loaves of leavened bread (see <a href='/NABRE/3/2/11'>2:11</a>).
NABRE,3,7,14,"[5] Contribution: Hebrew terumah. This does not indicate a particular ritual action. The word simply means ""gift, something set apart."""
NABRE,3,7,15,[6] 7:15-18 Sacrifices must be properly consumed for them to be effective (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/3/19/5'>19:5-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/22/30'>22:30</a>). Similar rules obtain for the Passover offering (<a href='/NABRE/2/12/10'>EXO 12:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/9/12'>NUM 9:12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/23/18'>EXO 23:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/25'>34:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/4'>DEU 16:4</a>) and the ordination offering (<a href='/NABRE/2/29/34'>EXO 29:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/8/32'>LEV 8:32</a>).
NABRE,3,7,16,[7] Votive or a voluntary offering: these are not specific types of offerings but rather motivations for bringing the communion sacrifice (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/22/18'>22:18</a>). A votive offering is brought as the consequence of a promise (vow) made to God. A voluntary offering is a spontaneous gift to God independent of a prior promise. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/27/2'>27:2-13</a>.
NABRE,3,7,18,"[8] Bear the penalty: this refers in many cases to punishment by God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/16'>17:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/19/8'>19:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/20/17'>20:17, 19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/18/1'>NUM 18:1, 23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/30/16'>30:16</a>)."

NABRE,3,7,20,"[10] Cut off: a common term in the Priestly source that cannot always be reduced to a simple English equivalent, since its usage appears to involve a number of associated punishments, some or all of which may come into play in any one instance (see <a href='/NABRE/2/12/15'>EXO 12:15</a> and note). All the same, as a punishment from God, to be ""cut off"" (from ones people) frequently appears to refer to termination of the offenders family line (and perhaps in some cases an early death); see <a href='/NABRE/3/20/2'>LEV 20:2-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/20/20'>20-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/8/4/10'>RUT 4:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/109/13'>PS 109:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/39/2/12'>MAL 2:12</a>."
NABRE,3,7,30,[11] Raised as an elevated offering: these portions of the sacrifices were specially dedicated by lifting them in presentation before Gods abode. The sanctifying effect of this action is clearly seen in <a href='/NABRE/3/23/17'>23:17-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/6/19'>NUM 6:19-20</a>.
NABRE,3,8,1,[1] 8:1-2 This chapter presents the fulfillment of the commands in <a href='/NABRE/2/28/1'>EXO 28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/29/1'>29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/30/26'>30:26-30</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/3/40/9'>40:9-15</a>.

Ephod: according to <a href='/NABRE/2/28/6'>EXO 28:6-14</a>, the term for one of Aarons special vestments made of gold thread, with multicolored woolen thread woven into it as well as fine linen. In appearance it resembled a kind of apron, hung on the priest by shoulder straps and secured by an embroidered belt. A somewhat simpler ""apron"" was presumably worn by other priests (<a href='/NABRE/9/22/18'>1SM 22:18</a>)."
NABRE,3,8,8,"[4] The Urim and Thummim: see <a href='/NABRE/2/28/30'>EXO 28:30</a> and note there. Although these terms and the object(s) they refer to are still unexplained, they appear to be small objects that functioned like dice or lots to render a decision for those making an inquiry of God, perhaps originally in legal cases where the guilt of the accused could not otherwise be determined (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/30'>EXO 28:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/27/21'>NUM 27:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/33/8'>DEU 33:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/28/6'>1SM 28:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/15/2/63'>EZR 2:63</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/7/65'>NEH 7:65</a>)."

NABRE,3,8,10,[6] 8:10-12 Anointing with the specially prepared oil (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/30/22'>EXO 30:22-33</a>) is one of the means of making objects and persons holy by setting them apart for a special function or purpose.
NABRE,3,8,15,[7] Moses took the blood: Moses is acting as a priest in this chapter.
NABRE,3,8,22,[8] 8:22-32 The priestly ordination offering is a unique type of sacrifice but similar in many respects to the communion sacrifice (chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/3/1'>3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/7/11'>7:11-34</a>).
NABRE,3,8,23,[9] 8:23-24 Lobe…thumb…toe: these parts of the body are meant to represent the body as a whole. The application of the blood symbolizes the priests passing from a profane to a holy state. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/14/14'>14:14-17</a>.
NABRE,3,8,33,"[10] 8:33-35 You are not to depart: the tenor and context of this requirement in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/8/33'>33</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/8/35'>35</a> seem to indicate that the priests are not to leave the sanctuary precincts for any reason. Your ordination is to last for seven days…what has been done today…be done: the consecration rites in Exodus are to be performed every day for seven days (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/29/30'>EXO 29:30</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/29/35'>35-37</a>)."
NABRE,3,9,1,[1] Eighth day: this is the conclusion of the priestly initiation ceremony.
NABRE,3,9,3,[2] 9:3-4 The seven-day consecration of the priests in chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/8/1'>8</a> did not require sacrifices from the community. Now communal sacrifices as well as priestly sacrifices are required.
NABRE,3,9,6,"[3] 9:6-21 Aaron and his sons now perform the offerings, instead of Moses (see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/8/15'>8:15</a>)."
NABRE,3,9,7,"[4] For your household: unlike the Septuagint, the Hebrew reads bead haam, ""for the people."""
NABRE,3,9,22,"[5] 9:22-23 The people are blessed twice. For the possible content of the blessing, compare the priestly blessing in <a href='/NABRE/4/6/22'>NUM 6:22-27</a>. Solomon offers a double blessing at the dedication of the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/14'>1KG 8:14-21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/8/55'>55-61</a>)."
NABRE,3,9,24,"[6] The theophany consists of a fire that apparently comes from the tent of meeting. Gods fiery glory is also manifested in the pillar of cloud and fire that led the Israelites and rested over the tent of meeting (<a href='/NABRE/2/13/21'>EXO 13:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/40/38'>40:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/9/15'>NUM 9:15-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/10/11'>10:11</a>).

NABRE,3,10,1,[1] 10:1-2 Nadab and Abihu are the older sons of Aaron (<a href='/NABRE/2/6/23'>EXO 6:23-24</a>). Their sin apparently involves using embers from an unapproved source instead of the altar (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/12'>16:12</a>). The fire that destroys them is the same type found in <a href='/NABRE/3/9/24'>9:24</a>.
NABRE,3,10,3,"[2] The explanation for the divine reaction indicates that improper cultic actions desecrate God and compromise Gods glory. Desecration evokes divine punishment (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/43'>EXO 28:43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/4/15'>NUM 4:15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/4/4/19'>19-20</a>). Those near to me: i.e., cultic officials."
NABRE,3,10,4,[3] 10:4-5 Moses has lay people remove the bodies so that the priests can continue their cultic activities free of contamination by a corpse (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/19/1'>NUM 19</a>).
NABRE,3,10,10,"[4] Sacred and…profane…clean and…unclean: something or someone may be either sacred or profane (i.e., ordinary, not set apart), and at the same time clean or unclean. Priests would be particularly concerned about keeping what is unclean away from the sacred."
NABRE,3,10,12,"[5] 10:12-13 Grain offering: this is the grain offering of the people of <a href='/NABRE/3/9/4'>9:4, 17</a>. Only the token offering had been offered; the rest was for the priests consumption."
NABRE,3,10,14,"[6] Brisket…leg: these are from the Israelites communion sacrifices in <a href='/NABRE/3/9/4'>9:4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/9/18'>18-21</a>."
NABRE,3,10,16,"[7] 10:16-20 Goat of the purification offering: this is the peoples purification offering of <a href='/NABRE/3/9/3'>9:3, 15</a>. Since its blood is not brought into the sanctuary, then, according to <a href='/NABRE/3/6/17'>6:17-23</a>, this is the type of purification offering which is to be eaten by the priests in a holy place. Eleazar and Ithamar: they burned the entire goat of the peoples purification offering (<a href='/NABRE/3/9/15'>9:15</a>) instead of eating it in a sacred place (<a href='/NABRE/3/6/19'>6:19</a>) to remove ritually the sin of the community by the ingestion of the meat of the offering. Aarons defense of this action of his sons is somewhat vague: he merely alludes to the loss suffered in the death of Nadab and Abihu, without giving an explicit reason for Eleazar and Ithamars not eating the peoples purification offering, as required."
NABRE,3,11,1,"[1] 11:1-15:33 Priestly legislation manifests two types of impurity or uncleanness: tolerated and prohibited. Prohibited impurity arises from various sins (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/3/4/1'>4:1-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/5/2'>5:2-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/18/6'>18:6-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/20/2'>20:2-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/5/13'>NUM 5:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/6/6'>6:6-7</a>). Tolerated impurity has three main sources: certain dead bodies (animal and human; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>LEV 11</a> and <a href='/NABRE/4/19/1'>NUM 19</a>), various regular and abnormal genital discharges (<a href='/NABRE/3/12/1'>LEV 12</a>; 15), and diseases (specifically ""scaly infection,"" chaps. <a href='/NABRE/3/13/1'>13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/14/1'>14</a>). An additional tolerated impurity is that generated by the cult in order to rectify the effect of these impurities or sins (cf. chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/4/1'>4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/16/26'>16:26, 28</a>)."
NABRE,3,11,1,"[2] 11:1-47 Apart from the introduction and conclusion (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>1-2</a>a, 46-47), this chapter has three sections: (1) prohibitions against eating certain land, water, and air animals (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/2'>2b</a>-23); (2) consequences of contact with various animals (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/24'>24-41</a>); (3) a prohibition against eating small land animals, which is motivated by the requirement that Israel be holy as God is holy (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/41'>41-45</a>). These animals are impure only when dead. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/14/3'>DEU 14:3-21</a>."
NABRE,3,11,5,"[3] 11:5-6 According to modern zoology, the rock hyrax(Hyrax syriacus) is classified as an ungulate, and the hareas a rodent; neither is a ruminant. They appear to chew their food as the true ruminants do, and it is upon this appearance that the classification in the text is based."
NABRE,3,11,13,"[4] 11:13-23, 30 Birds: the term is broader, including all animals that fly (including bats, v. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/19'>19</a>, and flying insects, vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/20'>20-23</a>). The identification of the various Hebrew names for these birds and reptiles is in many cases uncertain."
NABRE,3,11,39,"[5] 11:39-40 These animals create uncleanness, but are not prohibited as food (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/15'>17:15-16</a>). Priests who have a higher degree of holiness than other Israelites may not eat these animals (<a href='/NABRE/3/22/8'>22:8</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/44/31'>EZE 44:31</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/22/30'>EXO 22:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/14/21'>DEU 14:21</a>."
NABRE,3,11,44,"[6] 11:44-45 Keep yourselves holy…you shall be holy: a similar idea is expressed in <a href='/NABRE/3/20/25'>20:25-26</a>. There, distinguishing between the animals is compared to Gods distinguishing between the peoples and choosing Israel."
NABRE,3,12,2,"[1] 12:2-5 The mother has two stages of uncleanness or impurity: the first where her uncleanness is as severe as during her menstrual period and is contagious to profane persons and objects (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/15/19'>15:19-24</a>), and the second where she does not contaminate persons and objects but is still impure to what is holy, such as the sanctuary (<a href='/NABRE/3/12/4'>12:4</a>) or sacrifices. The implication is that in the second stage she may resume sexual relations with her husband (which would be prohibited in the first stage according to <a href='/NABRE/3/18/19'>18:19</a>)."
NABRE,3,12,3,[2] Circumcision is the sign of the covenant between God and Israel (<a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>GEN 17:1-27</a>) and allows full participation in the religious community (<a href='/NABRE/2/12/43'>EXO 12:43-49</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/5/2'>JOS 5:2-10</a>). This command was fulfilled after Jesus birth (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/21'>LUK 2:21</a>).
NABRE,3,12,5,"[3] If she gives birth to a girl…sixty-six days: while the longer period of uncleanness following the birth of a girl, compared to that following the birth of a boy, might reflect the relative disparity in social status between men and women in ancient Israel (and attested in other cultures), this is by no means certain. There is no simple correlation in the Bible between the worth of something and the degree of impurity it can occasion."
NABRE,3,12,6,"[4] 12:6-8 Certain tolerated impurities (see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>11:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/15/33'>15:33</a>) are strong enough to pollute the sanctuary and require purification offerings, including the parturient (see also <a href='/NABRE/3/14/10'>14:10-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/15/13'>15:13-15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/15/28'>28-30</a>). Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/3/4/3'>4:3</a>. Mary fulfilled the command of bringing sacrifices after the birth of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/22'>LUK 2:22-24</a>)."
NABRE,3,13,1,"[1] 13:1-14:57 These chapters deal with scaly or fungal infections (Hebrew ṣāraat). The older translation ""leprosy"" is misleading because ṣāraatrefers to not just one but several chronic and enduring skin diseases in human beings. The disease known as ""leprosy"" (Hansens disease) is probably not included among the conditions described in the chapter. Also the term ṣāraatrefers to fungal growths in fabrics and on the walls of houses. The reason why these conditions, and not other diseases, were considered unclean may be that they were quite visible, associated with death (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/12/9'>NUM 12:9-12</a>), and traditionally connected with punishment by the deity (<a href='/NABRE/3/14/34'>LEV 14:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/28/27'>DEU 28:27, 35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/3/29'>2SM 3:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/5/26'>2KG 5:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/26/16'>2CH 26:16-21</a>)."
NABRE,3,13,3,"[2] The symptoms of white hair and depth (perhaps a subcutaneous lesion) do not clearly correlate with known skin diseases or lesions. It may be that the symptoms are a hybrid ideal that do not reflect reality and are the result of priestly systematization. The same judgment applies to the conditions in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/13/10'>10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/25'>25</a>; cf. note on vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/13/12'>12-17</a>."
NABRE,3,13,4,"[3] 13:4-8 The symptoms here involve a flaky patch of skin that spreads after one week or stays the same after two. This correlates with many skin diseases, such as psoriasis, seborrhoeic dermatitis, certain mycotic infections, patchy eczema, and pityriasis rosea."
NABRE,3,13,4,"[4] Quarantine…seven days: unless lesions have unmistakable symptoms of scaly infection, time is needed to distinguish disease from a condition which is following the natural course of healing and remission. Cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/13/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/26'>26</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/27'>27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/31'>31</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/33'>33</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/50'>50</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/13/54'>54</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/14/38'>14:38</a>."
NABRE,3,13,6,"[5] Wash his garments: even suspected scaly infections create some impurity, not just diagnosed infections (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/13/45'>45-46</a>)."
NABRE,3,13,12,"[6] 13:12-17 This is not a paradox, namely where a limited lesion is impure but one that covers the whole body is pure. Rather, a white lesion that lacks ulcerated skin (""raw flesh"") is pure, even if it covers the whole body. This formulation reflects priestly interest in systematization."
NABRE,3,13,29,[7] 13:29-37 The symptoms in this unit may include either favus (a mycotic infection) or a protein deficiency syndrome (Kwashiorkor) where the hair may be fine and copper-red to yellow.
NABRE,3,13,38,"[8] 13:38-39 This may refer to vitiligo, where patches of the skin and hair lose pigmentation."
NABRE,3,13,45,"[9] 13:45-46 The symbolic association with death is found in the mourning activities in which those diagnosed with these afflictions engage: rending clothes, disheveling the hair, and covering the mouth. They are also excluded from the camp. Cf. examples of exclusion in <a href='/NABRE/4/5/1'>NUM 5:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/12/14'>12:14-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/7/3'>2KG 7:3-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/15/5'>15:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/26/21'>2CH 26:21</a>. Persons with scaly infections must have been able to pollute others in the priestly system, though this is not stated. Hence, they must cry out ""Unclean, unclean!"" to warn others of their presence."
NABRE,3,13,48,"[10] Warp and woof: it is possible that the nature of the weave allowed fungus to grow separately along warp or woof. Otherwise, this may refer to the yarns before they are woven together."
NABRE,3,14,1,"[1] 14:1-32 The rites here are for purification from human scaly infections after recovery, not for healing (but cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/5/10'>2KG 5:10-14</a>)."
NABRE,3,14,4,"[2] 14:4-7 The bird rite is also found for purifying a house from a fungus (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/14/49'>49-53</a>). The rite apparently removes impurity from the individual and, by means of the live bird, sends it away to unpopulated areas (v. <a href='/NABRE/3/14/7'>7</a>). This is similar to the dispatch of a goat laden with sins on the Day of Atonement (<a href='/NABRE/3/16/21'>16:21-22</a>)."
NABRE,3,14,5,"[3] 14:5-7 The blood from the bird serves as a ritual detergent, much like the blood from the purification offering (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/3/4/3'>4:3</a>). It is not a sacrifice, however, since it is not performed at the sanctuary. Fresh water: lit., ""living water,"" taken from some source of running water, not from a cistern."
NABRE,3,14,8,[4] Bathe in water: This phrase occurs frequently in <a href='/NABRE/3/14/1'>LEV 14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/16/1'>16</a> and is imprecise. It can refer to both ordinary and cultic washing. The context will determine the meaning. At this early period in Israels history it is probably not a reference to cultic immersion in a Mikveh—a Second Temple period ritual.
NABRE,3,14,10,[5] Log: a liquid measure of capacity attested in the Bible only here. It is apparently equal in capacity to one-half liter.
NABRE,3,14,14,[6] 14:14-17 The application of blood and oil here facilitates the movement of the person from the severely impure to the pure profane sphere; it reintegrates him or her into the community. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/8/23'>8:23-24</a>.
NABRE,3,14,33,[7] 14:33-53 Discussion of fungi in houses is probably delayed until here because it deals with a case pertaining to living in the land (v. <a href='/NABRE/3/14/34'>34</a>) as opposed to the foregoing cases which apply even in the wilderness. The rules on fabrics (<a href='/NABRE/3/13/47'>13:47-58</a>) apply to the tent dwellings in the wilderness.
NABRE,3,15,1,[1] 15:1-33 Sexual discharges may be unclean partly because they involve the loss of life fluids or are otherwise involved with phenomena at the margins of life and death.
NABRE,3,15,2,[2] 15:2-3 The uncleanness here is perhaps a discharge of pus because of urethritis (often but not solely associated with gonorrhea).
NABRE,3,15,3,"[3] Body: here a euphemism in the Hebrew for ""penis."""
NABRE,3,15,13,"[4] Becomes clean: i.e., when his discharge ceases. The rite that follows is for purification, not a cure; see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/14/1'>14:1-32</a>."
NABRE,3,15,16,"[5] 15:16-18 Menstrual blood, semen, and other impurities in <a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>LEV 11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/15/1'>15</a> are considered ""impure"" either because they are force of life whose ""loss"" represents death or because, as uniquely human conditions, they are symbolically incompatible with the deity and the divine abode, the sanctuary. <a href='/NABRE/3/15/16'>LEV 15:16</a> refers to a spontaneous nocturnal emission, and either because this marks life and death boundaries or because of its uniquely human (versus divine) character, any contact with it renders the object or person ritually unclean. Thus, in <a href='/NABRE/3/15/18'>15:18</a> it is not the marital act itself that is polluting, but only semen."
NABRE,3,15,19,[6] 15:19-24 This is normal menstruation.
NABRE,3,15,23,"[7] An object: the Hebrew is unclear. This translation means that even an object on the womans unclean bed or chair can mediate uncleanness to another, but only if all the object touched is still on the bed or article sat upon, thus forming a chain of simultaneous contact."
NABRE,3,15,25,[8] 15:25-30 This is menstruation outside the normal cycle or for periods longer than normal. A woman with a chronic blood flow was healed by touching the tassel of Jesus cloak (<a href='/NABRE/40/9/20'>MAT 9:20-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/5/25'>MAK 5:25-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/43'>LUK 8:43-48</a>).
NABRE,3,16,1,[1] 16:1-34 This is the narrative sequel of the story in chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/10/1'>10</a>. The ritual in chapter 16 originally may have been an emergency rite in response to unexpected pollution of the sanctuary.
NABRE,3,16,2,"[2] Not to come whenever he pleases: access to the various parts of the sanctuary is strictly controlled. Only the high priest can enter the most holy place, and only once a year. The veil: the Letter to the Hebrews makes use of the imagery of the Day of Atonement (in Hebrew Yom Kippur) to explain Jesus sacrifice (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/1'>HEB 9:1-14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/9/23'>23-28</a>). Arks cover: the meaning of kappōretis not certain. It may be connected with the verb kipper""to atone, purge"" (see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/6'>6</a>) and thus refer to this part of the ark as a focus of atonement or purification."
NABRE,3,16,6,"[3] Make atonement: the Hebrew verb kipperrefers specifically to the removal of sin and impurity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/30/10'>EXO 30:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/6/23'>LEV 6:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/8/15'>8:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/16/16'>16:16, 18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/27'>27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/33'>33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/43/20'>EZE 43:20, 26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/45/20'>45:20</a>), thus ""to purge"" in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/16'>16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/18'>18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/33'>33</a>, and more generally to the consequence of the sacrificial procedure, which is atonement (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/11'>LEV 17:11</a>). ""Atonement"" is preeminently a function of the purification sacrifice, but other sacrifices, except apparently for the communion sacrifice, achieve this as well."
NABRE,3,16,8,"[4] Azazel: a name for a demon (meaning something like ""angry/fierce god""). See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/17/7'>17:7</a>."
NABRE,3,16,16,"[5] Inner sanctuary: this refers to the most holy room (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/11'>11-15</a>). Trespasses, including all their sins: the term for ""trespasses"" (Heb. peshaim), which has overtones of rebellion, and the phrase ""all their sins"" indicate that even sins committed intentionally are included (such as when the sinner ""acts defiantly,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/4/15/30'>NUM 15:30-31</a>). This complements the scheme found in <a href='/NABRE/3/4/1'>LEV 4</a> (see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/4/3'>4:3</a>): intentional sins pollute the sanctuary more and penetrate even further than inadvertent sins, namely to the most holy place. The same for the tent of meeting: this rite may be that found in <a href='/NABRE/3/4/5'>4:5-7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/4/16'>16-18</a> where blood is sprinkled in the anterior room and blood is placed on the horns of the incense altar there. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/30/10'>EXO 30:10</a>."
NABRE,3,16,18,"[6] 16:18-19 Thus a third locale in the sanctuary complex, the open-air altar, is purified. See the summaries in <a href='/NABRE/3/16/20'>16:20, 33</a>."
NABRE,3,16,21,[7] Both hands: this gesture is for transferring sins to the head of the goat and is apparently different in meaning from the one-handed gesture that precedes the slaughtering of sacrificial animals (<a href='/NABRE/3/1/4'>1:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/3/2'>3:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/4/4'>4:4</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/1/4'>1:4</a>).
NABRE,3,16,29,"[8] Humble yourselves: also v. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/31'>31</a>. The idiom used here (Heb. innâ nephesh) involves mainly fasting (<a href='/NABRE/19/35/13'>PS 35:13</a>), but probably prohibits other activities such as anointing (<a href='/NABRE/27/10/3'>DAN 10:3</a>) and sexual intercourse (<a href='/NABRE/10/12/15'>2SM 12:15-24</a>). Such acts of self-denial display the need for divine favor. Fasting is often undertaken in times of emergency and mourning (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/14/24'>1SM 14:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/1/12'>2SM 1:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/3/35'>3:35</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/2/18'>MAK 2:18-22</a>)."
NABRE,3,17,3,"[1] 17:3-4 Any animal slaughtered must be brought to the tent of meeting as an offering. This differs from <a href='/NABRE/5/12/15'>DEU 12:15-28</a>, which allows those living too far from the temple to slaughter an animal for food at home without offering it as a sacrifice."
NABRE,3,17,4,[2] Guilty of bloodshed: human beings and animals can incur blood guilt for killing human beings (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/9/5'>GEN 9:5-6</a>); human beings can incur blood guilt for killing animals (see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/24/17'>LEV 24:17-22</a>).
NABRE,3,17,7,"[3] Demons: for Hebrew śeîrîm, lit., ""goats."" Like the demon Azazel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/8'>16:8, 10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/16/21'>21-22</a>), they dwell in the open country (<a href='/NABRE/3/17/5'>17:5</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/21'>ISA 13:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/34/14'>34:14</a>."
NABRE,3,17,11,[4] To make atonement: this is probably to be understood in the context of liability for shedding animal blood (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/4'>4</a>). Placing the blood on the altar exonerates the slaughterer from guilt for the killing. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/16/6'>16:6</a>.
NABRE,3,17,13,"[5] Hunting: game animals are not permitted as offerings. One nonetheless has to treat the blood of these animals carefully by covering it with earth. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/12/16'>DEU 12:16, 24</a>."
NABRE,3,18,2,"[1] I, the Lord, am your God: this declaration appears frequently elsewhere throughout chaps. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/1'>17</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/26/1'>26</a>, sometimes with a statement of Gods holiness or his sanctifying activity. It emphasizes the importance of the laws and the relationship of the divine lawgiver to the people."

NABRE,3,18,20,[10] Adultery in the Hebrew Bible and the ancient Near East is intercourse between a married or betrothed woman and any male.

The admonition at the end of v. <a href='/NABRE/3/19/18'>18</a> came to be viewed in Judaism and Christianity as one of the central commandments.

NABRE,3,20,9,"[3] 20:9-21 Bloodguilt: these penalties, beginning with cursing ones parents, reflect the concerns of a patriarchal society that the breakdown of ones relations with ones parents can lead to the breakdown of all other familial relationships, resulting in the breakdown of society."
NABRE,3,20,10,"[4] 20:10-21 See <a href='/NABRE/3/18/6'>18:6-23</a> and notes there. It appears that the inclusion of various penalties in <a href='/NABRE/3/20/10'>20:10-21</a> accounts for the different order of the cases here compared to the order found in <a href='/NABRE/3/18/6'>18:6-23</a>. The reason why the offenses in <a href='/NABRE/3/20/10'>20:10-21</a> carry different penalties, however, is not clear. Perhaps the cases in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/20/17'>17-21</a> were considered slightly less serious, being condemned but not criminally prosecuted."
NABRE,3,20,17,[5] Cut off: see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/7/20'>7:20</a>.
NABRE,3,21,1,"[1] 21:1-12 While off duty the regular priests are not to become corpse-contaminated except for the close relatives listed in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/21/2'>2-3</a>. While on duty they presumably could not become impure at all. The high priest is restricted from all corpse contamination, on or off duty (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/21/11'>11-12</a>). Lay Israelites are not restricted from corpse contamination, except when in contact with what is holy (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/26/14'>DEU 26:14</a>). See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/11/39'>LEV 11:39-40</a>. Israelites who undertake a nazirite vow enter into a sanctified state and cannot contact corpses (<a href='/NABRE/4/6/6'>NUM 6:6-12</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/44/25'>EZE 44:25-27</a>."
NABRE,3,21,4,[2] Husband among his kindred: this probably refers to relatives by marriage and may even include his wife.
NABRE,3,21,7,"[3] The ideal seems to be that a priest marry a virgin. This is explicitly stated for the high priest (cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/21/13'>13-14</a>; so also <a href='/NABRE/26/44/22'>EZE 44:22</a>, except there priests may marry widows of priests). The high priest has the added limitation that his wife must come from his kindred, i.e., the priestly family (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/44/22'>EZE 44:22</a>)."
NABRE,3,21,15,"[4] 21:16-23 Though priests with certain bodily imperfections cannot serve at the altar (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/21/18'>18-20</a>), they are not impure, since they may still eat of the offerings, which are holy, and do so within the sanctuary precincts since it is there the most holy offerings are to be eaten (v. <a href='/NABRE/3/21/22'>22</a>)."
NABRE,3,22,1,"[1] 22:1-16 While priests with bodily imperfections may eat the holy sacrifices (<a href='/NABRE/3/21/16'>21:16-23</a>), those impure and those not of the priestly household may not."
NABRE,3,22,3,"[2] 22:3-8 On uncleanness, see chaps. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/1'>11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/15/1'>15</a> and notes there."
NABRE,3,22,8,[3] See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/11/39'>11:39-40</a>.
NABRE,3,22,11,"[4] Slave: in contrast to the tenant or hired worker of v. <a href='/NABRE/3/22/10'>10</a>, the slave, who is by definition a foreigner, is part of the priests household and therefore may eat of sacrifices."
NABRE,3,22,12,"[5] 22:12-13 A priests daughter, when a dependent of her father, may eat of the lesser holy offerings."
NABRE,3,22,17,[6] 22:17-25 This passage complements the section on the bodily imperfections of priests in <a href='/NABRE/3/21/16'>21:16-23</a>. The laws taken together indicate that whoever and whatever approaches and contacts the altar needs to be physically unimpaired.
NABRE,3,22,23,"[7] Burnt offerings and communion sacrifices brought as voluntary offerings may have slight defects, probably because they are freely given and do not depend upon a prior promise as do votive offerings."
NABRE,3,22,26,"[8] 22:26-30 Other activities and procedures that would impair sacrifice are appended here. The rules in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/22/27'>27-28</a> are reminiscent of the rule not to boil a young goat in its mothers milk (<a href='/NABRE/2/23/19'>EXO 23:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/26'>34:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/14/21'>DEU 14:21</a>) and not to take a bird and its eggs (<a href='/NABRE/5/22/6'>DEU 22:6-7</a>), all of which have a humanitarian tenor."
NABRE,3,23,1,"[1] 23:1-44 This is paralleled by another calendar from the Priestly tradition, in <a href='/NABRE/4/28/1'>NUM 28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/4/29/1'>29</a>. Non-Priestly resumes of festal and holy observances are found in <a href='/NABRE/2/23/10'>EXO 23:10-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/18'>34:18-24</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/16/1'>DEU 16:1-17</a>."
NABRE,3,23,3,"[2] Sabbath of complete rest: the sabbath and the Day of Atonement are called ""sabbaths of complete rest"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/16/23'>EXO 16:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/31/15'>31:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/35/2'>35:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/16/31'>LEV 16:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/32'>23:32</a>). Work of any sort is prohibited on these days (<a href='/NABRE/3/23/3'>LEV 23:3, 28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/29/7'>NUM 29:7</a>) as opposed to other holy days where only laborious work is prohibited but light work, such as preparing food, is allowed (<a href='/NABRE/2/12/16'>EXO 12:16</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/7'>LEV 23:7, 8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/23/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/23/25'>25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/23/35'>35</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/23/36'>36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/28/18'>NUM 28:18, 25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/4/28/26'>26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/29/1'>29:1, 12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/4/29/35'>35</a>)."
NABRE,3,23,5,"[3] 23:5-6 The Passover of the Lord…feast of Unleavened Bread: the two occasions were probably separate originally. Combined they celebrate the exodus from Egypt. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/12/1'>EXO 12:1-20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/12/43'>43-49</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/28/16'>NUM 28:16-25</a>."
NABRE,3,23,9,"[4] 23:9-14 Around Passover a first fruits offering is to be brought (see <a href='/NABRE/3/2/14'>2:14</a>), consisting of a sheaf of barley, the crop that matures at this time of year."
NABRE,3,23,11,"[5] Day after the sabbath: the singular term shabbat""sabbath"" may mean ""week"" here and refer to the seven-day period of the feast of Unleavened Bread. According to this interpretation, the barley sheaf is offered the day after the week of Unleavened Bread. Others understand it as referring to the first or last day of Unleavened Bread."
NABRE,3,23,16,"[6] 23:16-21 Fifty days: Pentecost. This festival occurs on a single day, fifty days after the feast of Unleavened Bread, elsewhere called the ""feast of the Harvest"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/23/16'>EXO 23:16</a>), ""Day of First Fruits"" (<a href='/NABRE/4/28/26'>NUM 28:26</a>), and ""feast of Weeks"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/34/22'>EXO 34:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/10'>DEU 16:10, 16</a>). The name Pentecost comes from the later Greek term for the holy day (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/2/1'>ACT 2:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/20/16'>20:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/16/8'>1CO 16:8</a>), referring to the fiftieth day. This is the occasion for bringing the first fruits of the wheat harvest."
NABRE,3,23,24,"[7] First day of the seventh month: the seventh new moon is counted from a new year beginning in the spring (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/5'>5</a>). Like the seventh day in the week, it is preeminent among the new moon days (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/28/11'>NUM 28:11-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/29/1'>29:1-6</a>)."
NABRE,3,23,27,[8] Day of Atonement: see chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/1'>16</a> and notes there.
NABRE,3,23,34,"[9] Feast of Booths: this is the final harvest festival of the year celebrating the remaining harvest. It is called the ""feast of Ingathering"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/23/16'>EXO 23:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/22'>34:22</a>), the ""feast of Booths"" (<a href='/NABRE/3/23/34'>LEV 23:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/13'>DEU 16:13</a>), or simply the ""feast"" (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/65'>1KG 8:65</a>). It is a seven-day festival with an eighth closing day. The first and eighth days are rest days (see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/3'>3</a>)."
NABRE,3,23,37,[10] 23:37-38 This appears to be the original conclusion of the chapter.
NABRE,3,23,39,"[11] 23:39-43 The feast of the Lord: the feast of Booths, the preeminent festival. This section supplements vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/33'>33-36</a> by prescribing the popular activities for the festival."
NABRE,3,23,40,"[12] 23:40-43 Fruit…branches…boughs: the fruit and/or foliage from these trees is to be gathered, but it is not said how they are used. The command to make merry suggests they may have been used in a procession or even circumambulation of the altar (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/26/6'>PS 26:6</a>). Later tradition understood these prescriptions as referring to making the booths out of the foliage (<a href='/NABRE/16/8/15'>NEH 8:15</a>)."
NABRE,3,24,1,"[1] 24:1-4 On the lamp, see <a href='/NABRE/2/25/31'>EXO 25:31-40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/26/35'>26:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/27/20'>27:20-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/37/17'>37:17-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/40/24'>40:24-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/8/1'>NUM 8:1-4</a>. It occupies the south side of the anterior room of the sanctuary tent and provides light for that room."
NABRE,3,24,4,"[2] 24:5-9 On the bread table, see <a href='/NABRE/2/25/23'>EXO 25:23-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/26/35'>26:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/37/10'>37:10-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/40/22'>40:22-23</a>. It occupies the north side of the anterior room of the sanctuary tent. The bread is a type of grain offering (see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/2/1'>2:1</a>)."
NABRE,3,24,9,[3] 24:10-22 This is a narrative where an offense leads to clarifying revelation similar to the cases in <a href='/NABRE/3/10/1'>LEV 10:1-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/16/1'>16:1-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/9/6'>NUM 9:6-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/15/32'>15:32-36</a>.
NABRE,3,24,14,[4] Laid their hands: see notes on <a href='/NABRE/3/1/4'>1:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/16/21'>16:21</a>. It may be that blasphemy generated a type of pollution which the hearers return to the culprit by this gesture.
NABRE,3,24,17,[5] 24:17-22 A digression dealing with bodily injury follows the blasphemy rules. It may have been appended since the first case is another example of the death penalty. But the section develops according to its own logic. All legal traditions require death for homicide: <a href='/NABRE/1/9/5'>GEN 9:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/21/12'>EXO 21:12-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/35/9'>NUM 35:9-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/19/1'>DEU 19:1-13</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/13'>EXO 20:13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/5/17'>DEU 5:17</a>.
NABRE,3,24,19,"[6] 24:19-20 The phrase ""life for a life"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/3/24/18'>18</a> leads to introducing the law of talion in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/24/19'>19-20</a>. Some have interpreted the law here and the similar expressions in <a href='/NABRE/2/21/23'>EXO 21:23-25</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/19/21'>DEU 19:21</a> to mean that monetary compensation equal to the injury is to be paid, though the wording of the law here and the context of <a href='/NABRE/5/19/21'>DEU 19:21</a> indicate an injury is to be inflicted upon the injurer."
NABRE,3,25,2,"[1] 25:2-7 As every seventh day is to be a day of rest (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/3'>23:3</a>), so every seventh year is a year of rest (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/26/34'>26:34-35</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/26/43'>43</a>). The rest consists in not doing agricultural work. The people are to live off what grows naturally in the fields (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/6'>6-7</a>). Verses 19-22 add insurance by saying that God will make the sixth-year crop abundant such that its excess will stretch over the seventh sabbatical year as well as the eighth year when new crops are not yet harvested (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/26/10'>26:10</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/23/10'>EXO 23:10-11</a>."
NABRE,3,25,8,"[2] 25:8-17 The fiftieth year is the jubilee, determined by counting off ""seven weeks of years."" It is sacred, like the sabbath day. Specifically, in it indentured Israelites return to their own households and land that has been sold returns to its original owner. Different laws are found in <a href='/NABRE/2/21/1'>EXO 21:1-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/15/1'>DEU 15:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/5/15/12'>12-18</a> (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/34/8'>JER 34:8-22</a>)."
NABRE,3,25,9,"[3] Seventh month: the priestly laws reflect the use of two calendars, one starting in the spring (cf. chap. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/1'>23</a>) and one in the fall. The jubilee is calculated on the basis of the latter. Rams horn: Hebrew shophar. The name for the year, jubilee (Heb. yobel), also means ""rams horn"" and comes from the horn blown to announce the occasion."
NABRE,3,25,22,"[4] 25:23-55 This is a series of laws dealing mainly with situations of poverty in which one has to sell land, obtain a loan, or become indentured. Many of the laws are connected with the release of debts in the jubilee year."
NABRE,3,25,25,[5] A close family member is responsible for redemption. Some of these are specified in v. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/49'>49</a>.
NABRE,3,25,29,"[6] 25:29-31 Not being able to redeem a house in a walled city after one year is probably due to the demographic and economic situation of large towns as opposed to small villages and open agricultural areas. The agricultural lands associated with the latter were the foundation for the economic viability of the Israelite family, and as such, God—who is the ultimate owner of the land (<a href='/NABRE/3/25/23'>25:23</a>)—has assigned them to the Israelites as permanent holdings."
NABRE,3,25,32,"[7] 25:32-34 An exception to the rule in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/29'>29-31</a> is made for levitical cities (<a href='/NABRE/4/35/1'>NUM 35:1-8</a>), since the Levites have no broad land holdings. Their houses can be redeemed and are to be released in the jubilee year."
NABRE,3,25,36,"[8] Interest in advance or accrued interest: two types of interest are mentioned here. The former may refer to interest subtracted from the loaned amount in advance, and the latter, to interest or a payment in addition to the loaned amount."
NABRE,3,25,39,"[9] 25:39-43 Here the individual Israelite has no assets and must become indentured to another Israelite for economic survival. No provision is given for redemption before the jubilee year, though such is probably allowed."
NABRE,3,25,44,"[10] 25:44-46 While Israelites may not be held as permanent slaves (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/39'>39-43</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/25/47'>47-55</a>), foreigners may be. They are not released in the jubilee, but may be bequeathed to ones children. They may be treated as ""slaves,"" i.e., harshly (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/21/20'>EXO 21:20-21</a>)."
NABRE,3,26,1,[1] 26:1-46 This chapter concludes the revelation of laws at Mount Sinai (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/3/26/46'>46</a>). Blessings and curses are also found at the end of Deuteronomys law collection (<a href='/NABRE/5/28/1'>DEU 28</a>). Similar lists of blessings and curses appear in the conclusions of ancient Near Eastern treaties.
NABRE,3,26,3,"[2] 26:3-13 The blessings are concerned with the well-being of the nation and its land and involve agricultural bounty, national security, military success and population growth."
NABRE,3,26,13,"[3] 26:14-46 To encourage obedience, the list of punishments is longer than the blessings (cf. a similar proportion in <a href='/NABRE/5/28/1'>DEU 28</a>). The punishments are presented in waves (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/26/14'>14-17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/26/18'>18-20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/26/21'>21-22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/26/23'>23-26</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/26/27'>27-39</a>), one group following another if the people do not return to obedience. Punishments involve sickness, pestilence, agricultural failure and famine, attack of wild animals, death of the peoples children, destruction of illicit and even licit cults, military defeat, panic, and exile."
NABRE,3,26,40,"[4] 26:40-45 Even though the people may be severely punished, God will remember the covenant when the people repent."
NABRE,3,27,2,"[1] 27:2-13 Vows are conditional promissory oaths. One covenants to do something for the benefit of God, usually to make a dedication, if God fulfills the individuals accompanying request (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/28/20'>GEN 28:20-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/11/30'>JUG 11:30-31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/1/11'>1SM 1:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/15/7'>2SM 15:7-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/56/13'>PS 56:13-14</a>). Vows must be fulfilled (<a href='/NABRE/4/30/3'>NUM 30:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/23/22'>DEU 23:22</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/66/13'>PS 66:13-15</a>). Verses 2-8 deal with votive offerings involving human beings. Actual dedication of human beings (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/11/30'>JUG 11:30-31</a>, <a href='/NABRE/7/11/34'>34-40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/1/11'>1SM 1:11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/1/24'>24-28</a>) is obviated by payment of the persons value (mentioned in the temple income in <a href='/NABRE/12/12/5'>2KG 12:5</a>). The values reflect the different economic and administrative roles of people in different age and gender groups within ancient Israelite society. Verses 9-13 concern the bringing of animals for a vow."
NABRE,3,27,12,"[2] Determine its value: in contrast to human beings (vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/3'>3-7</a>) there are no set values for unclean animals, and the condition of the animal is taken into consideration (cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/14'>14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/27/27'>27</a>)."
NABRE,3,27,14,"[3] 27:14-24 These verses deal with dedications. They take effect when uttered and, unlike vows, they are not conditional. They are related to the jubilee year laws in <a href='/NABRE/3/25/23'>25:23-31</a>."
NABRE,3,27,14,"[4] House as sacred to the Lord: the house becomes sanctuary property and presumably may be sold to another if the owner does not redeem it (cf. notes on vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/3/27/21'>21</a>). While <a href='/NABRE/3/25/31'>25:31</a> requires that unredeemed houses in unwalled towns be returned to the original owners at the jubilee, in the laws here such houses apparently become the property of the sanctuary (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/21'>21</a>). It is likely that dedicated houses in a walled city needed to be redeemed within one year, following <a href='/NABRE/3/25/29'>25:29-30</a>."
NABRE,3,27,16,[5] Homer: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,3,27,19,"[6] Redeem: the person apparently can redeem the land up to the jubilee year, following <a href='/NABRE/3/25/23'>25:23-28</a>. See note on v. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/21'>21</a>."
NABRE,3,27,20,"[7] If…one sells it: the verse is difficult since the person should not be able to sell the land after it is dedicated. The verb ""sells"" may be construed impersonally here: ""If…it is sold,"" i.e., by the sanctuary."
NABRE,3,27,21,"[8] Released as sacred: the dedication changes the ownership of the land. It now belongs to the sanctuary. It returns to the sanctuarys possession after leasing it out (v. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/20'>20</a>). Presumably if the land remained in the sanctuarys possession until the jubilee, and it was not redeemed, the land would belong permanently to the sanctuary and priests."
NABRE,3,27,24,"[9] In contrast to the cases in vv. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/14'>14-15</a> and <a href='/NABRE/3/27/16'>16-21</a>, this land returns to the original owner since that individual did not personally make the dedication. The principle is that one cannot permanently dedicate what one does not own. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/24/22'>2SM 24:22-25</a>."
NABRE,3,27,26,"[10] Firstborn animals and human beings already belong to God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/13/1'>EXO 13:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/13/12'>12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/19'>34:19</a>); they cannot be vowed or dedicated. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/15'>NUM 18:15-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/15/19'>DEU 15:19-23</a>."
NABRE,3,27,27,"[11] An unclean animal: such as the firstborn of a donkey, which was unfit for sacrifice. According to <a href='/NABRE/2/13/13'>EXO 13:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/20'>34:20</a>, a firstborn donkey was to be redeemed by offering a sheep in its stead, or was to have its neck broken."

NABRE,4,18,2,"[3] Be joined to you: in Hebrew a pun on the popular etymology of the name ""Levi."" Cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/29/34'>GEN 29:34</a>."
NABRE,4,18,4,"[4] Unauthorized person: here, ""one who is not a Levite""; in v. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/7'>7</a>, ""one who is not a priest."""
NABRE,4,18,7,"[5] Veil: the outer veil, or ""curtain,"" is probably meant."
NABRE,4,18,8,"[6] 18:8-10 Two classes of offerings are here distinguished: the most holy offering, which only the male members of the priestly families could eat (vv. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/8'>8-10</a>), and the other offerings, which the women of the priestly families could eat (vv. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/11'>11-19</a>)."
NABRE,4,18,10,"[7] In a most holy place: in the court of the tabernacle, according to <a href='/NABRE/3/6/9'>LEV 6:9, 19</a>."
NABRE,4,18,11,"[8] Elevated offering: this included the brisket and right thigh (v. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/18'>18</a>), the shoulder of the peace offering (<a href='/NABRE/3/7/30'>LEV 7:30-34</a>), and portions of the nazirite sacrifice (<a href='/NABRE/4/6/19'>NUM 6:19-20</a>). With you: see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/1'>1</a>. Aaron had no daughters; see also v. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/19'>19</a>."
NABRE,4,18,14,"[9] Under the ban: in Hebrew, herem, which means here ""set aside from profane use and made sacred to the Lord."" Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/21'>LEV 27:21, 28</a>."
NABRE,4,18,19,[10] A covenant of salt: cf. <a href='/NABRE/14/13/5'>2CH 13:5</a>. The reference may perhaps be to the preservative power of salt (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/5/13'>MAT 5:13</a>); but more likely the phrase refers to the custom of eating salt together to render a contract unbreakable. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/2/13'>LEV 2:13</a>.
NABRE,4,18,20,"[11] The priests and Levites were forbidden to own hereditary land such as the other Israelites possessed; therefore in the allotment of the land (chap. <a href='/NABRE/4/34/1'>34</a>) they did not receive any portion of it. Certain cities, however, were assigned to them for their residence; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/35/1'>35:1-8</a>."
NABRE,4,18,23,[12] Incur the penalty for the Israelites sin: the Levites are responsible for protecting the sanctuary from illegitimate encroachment and in this sense pay the penalty for the Israelites iniquity. This responds further to the fears of the people expressed in <a href='/NABRE/4/17/27'>17:27-28</a>.
NABRE,4,19,3,"[1] Outside the camp: several early Christian writers saw in this a prefiguring of the sacrificial death of Jesus outside the walls of Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/19/20'>JHN 19:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/13/12'>HEB 13:12</a>; in the purifying water, into which the ashes of the red heifer were put, they saw a type of the water of Baptism."
NABRE,4,19,4,"[2] Toward the front of the tent of meeting: since the tabernacle faced the east (<a href='/NABRE/2/26/15'>EXO 26:15-30</a>), the killing of the heifer would take place east of the camp; in later times it was done on the Mount of Olives, east of the Temple."
NABRE,4,19,20,"[3] Ritual uncleanness is, as it were, contagious; so also sacredness; see note on <a href='/NABRE/4/17/3'>17:3</a>."
NABRE,4,20,1,"[1] The wilderness of Zin: a barren region with a few good oases, southwest of the Dead Sea. See note on <a href='/NABRE/4/13/21'>13:21</a>. The first month: we would expect the mention also of the day and of the year (after the exodus) when this took place; cf. similar dates in <a href='/NABRE/4/1/1'>1:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/10/11'>10:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/33/38'>33:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/1/3'>DEU 1:3</a>. Here the full date is left unspecified. According to one chronology, the Israelites arrived in Kadesh in the third year after the exodus (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/1/46'>DEU 1:46</a>). But the itinerary in chap. <a href='/NABRE/4/33/1'>33</a> would suggest the fortieth year, the year in which Aaron died (<a href='/NABRE/4/33/38'>33:38</a>)."
NABRE,4,20,11,[2] Twice: perhaps because he did not have sufficient faith to work the wonder with the first blow. Cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/4/20/12'>12</a>.
NABRE,4,20,12,"[3] 20:12-13 What lay behind Moses and Aarons lack of confidence is not made explicit in the text. Holiness: an allusion to the name of the place, Kadesh, which means ""holy, sanctified, sacred."" Meribah means ""contention."" Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/17/7'>EXO 17:7</a>."
NABRE,4,20,14,"[4] Your brother Israel: according to biblical tradition, the Edomites were descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob. Their country, to the southeast of the Dead Sea, was also known as Seir; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/25/24'>GEN 25:24-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/36/1'>36:1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/36/8'>8-9</a>."
NABRE,4,20,17,"[5] The Kings Highway: an important highway, running north and south along the plateau east of the Dead Sea. In ancient times it was much used by caravans and armies; later it was improved by the Romans, and large stretches of it are still clearly recognizable."
NABRE,4,20,22,"[6] Mount Hor: not definitively identified, but probably to be sought in the vicinity of Kadesh. According to <a href='/NABRE/5/10/6'>DEU 10:6</a>, Aaron died at Moserah (cf. ""Moseroth"" in <a href='/NABRE/4/33/30'>NUM 33:30-31</a>), which is apparently the name of the region in which Mount Hor is situated."
NABRE,4,21,1,"[1] 21:1-3 The account of this episode seems to be a later insertion here, since logically v. <a href='/NABRE/4/21/4'>4</a> belongs immediately after <a href='/NABRE/4/20/29'>20:29</a>. Perhaps this is the same event as that mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/7/1/16'>JUG 1:16-17</a>."
NABRE,4,21,3,"[2] Hormah: related to the Hebrew word herem, meaning ""put under the ban."" See notes on <a href='/NABRE/4/14/45'>14:45</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/18/14'>18:14</a>."
NABRE,4,21,5,[3] This wretched food: apparently the manna is meant.
NABRE,4,21,6,"[4] Seraph: the Hebrew name for a certain species of venomous snake; etymologically the word might signify ""the fiery one."" Compare the winged throne guardians in <a href='/NABRE/23/6/2'>ISA 6:2, 6</a>; see also <a href='/NABRE/23/14/29'>ISA 14:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/6'>30:6</a>."
NABRE,4,21,8,[5] Everyone who has been bitten will look at it and recover: in the Gospel of John this scene is regarded as a type for the crucifixion of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/14'>JHN 3:14-15</a>).
NABRE,4,21,9,"[6] King Hezekiah, in his efforts to reform Israelite worship, ""smashed the bronze serpent Moses had made"" (<a href='/NABRE/12/18/4'>2KG 18:4</a>)."
NABRE,4,21,11,"[7] Iye-abarim: probably means ""the ruins in the Abarim (Mountains)."" See note on <a href='/NABRE/4/27/12'>27:12</a>."
NABRE,4,21,14,"[8] The ""Book of the Wars of the Lord"": an ancient collection of Israelite songs, now lost. Waheb in Suphah: since neither place is mentioned elsewhere, it is uncertain whether these Hebrew words are to be considered as place names; some Hebrew words, now lost, must have preceded this phrase."
NABRE,4,21,15,"[9] Ar: a city or district in Moab, located on the Arnon; see v. <a href='/NABRE/4/21/28'>28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/2/18'>DEU 2:18</a>."
NABRE,4,21,16,"[10] Beer: ""a well,"" here used as a place name."
NABRE,4,21,20,"[11] Jeshimon: ""the wasteland""; in <a href='/NABRE/9/23/19'>1SM 23:19, 24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/26/1'>26:1, 3</a>, this is the wilderness of Judah on the western side of the Dead Sea, but here and in <a href='/NABRE/4/23/28'>NUM 23:28</a>, it seems to refer to the southern end of the Jordan valley where Beth-jeshimoth was situated."
NABRE,4,21,29,"[12] Chemosh: the chief god of the Moabites, mentioned in the famous inscription of Mesha, king of Moab, who ruled at the same time as the Omrides in Israel. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/11/7'>1KG 11:7, 33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/13'>2KG 23:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/48/7'>JER 48:7, 13</a>."
NABRE,4,22,1,"[1] The plains of Moab: the lowlands to the northeast of the Dead Sea, between the Jordan and the foothills below Mount Nebo. Here the Israelites remained until they crossed the Jordan, according to <a href='/NABRE/6/1/1'>JOS 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/4/1'>4</a>. Jericho lay to the west of the Jordan."
NABRE,4,22,5,"[2] In the land of the Ammonites: the translation rests on a slight emendation of the traditional Hebrew text in accordance with the tradition represented by the Vulgate. While Pethor remains unidentified, this verse supports an identification of Balaams homeland in the Transjordan (cf. the Deir Alla Inscriptions), over against other traditions in the text which connect Balaam with Syria (<a href='/NABRE/4/23/7'>23:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/23/5'>DEU 23:5</a>)."
NABRE,4,22,6,"[3] Curse this people for me: Balak believed that Balaam, known in the tradition as a diviner (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/13/22'>JOS 13:22</a>), could utter a curse upon Israel which would come to pass."
NABRE,4,22,7,"[4] Experts in divination: lit., ""divination was in their hand,"" i.e., ""in their possession""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/15/7/25'>EZR 7:25</a>."
NABRE,4,22,21,[5] Donkey: technically a she-donkey; Heb. aton.
NABRE,4,22,22,"[6] Gods anger flared up: Gods apparent change of mind became a source of much speculation in the tradition. So, for example, God was angry, not merely because Balaam was going to Balak, for he had Gods permission for the journey (v. <a href='/NABRE/4/22/20'>20</a>), but perhaps because he was tempted by greed to curse Israel against Gods command (cf. <a href='/NABRE/61/2/15'>2PE 2:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/65/1/11'>JUD 1:11</a>; compare <a href='/NABRE/4/22/32'>NUM 22:32</a>). Adversary: Heb. satan; see also v. <a href='/NABRE/4/22/32'>32</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/29/4'>1SM 29:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/19/22'>2SM 19:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/11/1'>1KG 11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/1/1'>JOB 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/2/1'>2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/109/6'>PS 109:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/3/1'>ZEC 3:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/21/1'>1CH 21:1</a>."
NABRE,4,23,7,"[1] Aram: the ancient name of the region later known as Syria. The mountains of Qedem: Qedem is the name for a region in northern Syria. Qedem also means ""eastern."" Perhaps this designates the low ranges in the Syrian desert. The ""mountains of old"" is also a possible translation."
NABRE,4,23,9,"[2] A people that lives apart: that is, ""securely""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/33/28'>DEU 33:28</a>."
NABRE,4,23,10,[3] The dust of Jacob…Israels dust-cloud: the Israelites will be as numerous as the dust kicked up by Israel in its march through the wilderness.
NABRE,4,23,13,"[4] To another place: Balak thought that if Balaam would view Israel from a different site, he could deliver a different kind of omen."
NABRE,4,23,21,[5] Misfortune…misery: Balaam states that he is unable to see any evils for Israel.
NABRE,4,23,22,"[6] A wild oxs horns: Israel possesses the strength of a wild ox because of Gods presence among them. Compare the claim by the psalmist, the Lord is ""my rock…my saving horn"" (<a href='/NABRE/19/18/3'>PS 18:3</a>)."
NABRE,4,24,4,"[1] In rapture: lit., ""falling,"" therefore possibly ""in a trance."" However, this interpretation is uncertain."
NABRE,4,24,7,"[2] Agag: during Sauls reign, king of Amalek (<a href='/NABRE/9/15/8'>1SM 15:8</a>), fierce enemy of Israel during the wilderness period; see v. <a href='/NABRE/4/24/20'>20</a> (<a href='/NABRE/2/17/8'>EXO 17:8-16</a>)."
NABRE,4,24,10,"[3] Balak clapped his hands: a gesture suggesting contempt or derision, apparently made in anger (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/27/23'>JOB 27:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/25/2/15'>LAM 2:15</a>)."
NABRE,4,24,17,"[4] A star…a scepter: some early Christian writers, as well as rabbinic interpreters, understood this prophecy in messianic terms. So, for example, Rabbi Akiba designates Bar Kosiba the messiah in the early second century A.D. by calling him Bar Kokhba, i.e., son of the star, alluding to this passage. Although this text is not referred to anywhere in the New Testament, in a Christian messianic interpretation the star would refer to Jesus, as also the scepter from Israel; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/1'>ISA 11:1</a>. But it is doubtful whether this passage is to be connected with the ""star of the Magi"" in <a href='/NABRE/40/2/1'>MAT 2:1-12</a>. The brows of Moab, and the skull of all the Sethites: under the figure of a human being, Moab is specified as the object of conquest by a future leader of Israel. The personification of peoples or toponyms is common enough in the Old Testament; see, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/28/11/1'>HOS 11:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/98/8'>PS 98:8</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/24/48/45'>JER 48:45</a>, which paraphrases the latter part of our verse, Moab is depicted as someone whose boasting warrants its ruin. In view of the use of Heb. peah(here ""brows"") in <a href='/NABRE/4/34/3'>NUM 34:3</a> to indicate a boundary, some see in the ""brows"" of Moab and the ""skull"" of the Sethites a representation of features of Moabs topography, i.e., the borderlands and the interior plateau. The Sethites: cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/4/25'>GEN 4:25</a>; here probably a general designation for nomadic/tribal groups on the borders of Palestine, unless they are to be identified with the Shutu mentioned in Execration texts of the early second millennium B.C. and the fourteenth century Amarna tablets from Egypt; however, the Shutu are not attested in Moab. On the basis of <a href='/NABRE/1/4/25'>GEN 4:25</a> and <a href='/NABRE/1/25/1'>GEN 25</a>, one might also think of a reference to humanity in general."
NABRE,4,24,20,"[5] First: lit., ""the beginning."" In the Bible, Amalek is a people indigenous to Palestine and therefore considered as of great antiquity. There is a deliberate contrast here between the words ""first"" and ""end."""
NABRE,4,24,21,"[6] The Keniteslived in high strongholds in the mountains of southern Palestine and the Sinai Peninsula, and were skilled in working the various metals found in their territory. Their name is connected, at least by popular etymology, with the Hebrew word for ""smith""; of similar sound to qayin, i.e., ""Kain"" or ""smith,"" is the Hebrew word for ""nest,"" qen—hence the play on words in the present passage."
NABRE,4,24,22,"[7] Asshur: the mention of Asshur, i.e., Assyria, is not likely before the ninth or eighth centuries B.C."
NABRE,4,24,23,"[8] 24:23-24 Upon seeing: this phrase, lacking the Hebrew text, is found in the Septuagint, but without ""the Ishmaelites"" designated as the subject of the oracle. The Hebrew text of the oracle itself shows considerable disarray; the translation therefore relies on reconstruction of the putative original and is quite uncertain."
NABRE,4,25,1,"[1] Shittim: the full name was Abel-shittim, a locality at the foot of the mountains in the northeastern corner of the plains of Moab (<a href='/NABRE/4/33/49'>33:49</a>). Prostituting themselves: the application to men of such traditional language for apostasy clearly suggests apostasy was taken to be an inevitable consequence of intermarriage with the Midianite women."
NABRE,4,25,4,"[2] Publicly execute them: the same phrase occurs in <a href='/NABRE/10/21/6'>2SM 21:6-14</a>, where the context shows that at least a part of the penalty consisted in being denied honorable burial. In both passages, dismemberment or impalement (perhaps subsequent to the actual execution) as a punishment for the breaking of covenant pledges, is a possible interpretation of the Hebrew phrase."
NABRE,4,25,5,[3] Thereby Moses apparently alters the Lords command to execute all the leaders.
NABRE,4,25,6,"[4] Midianite woman: according to <a href='/NABRE/4/22/4'>22:4, 7</a>, the Midianites were allied with the Moabites in opposing Israel, while <a href='/NABRE/4/31/16'>31:16</a> claims that Balaam had induced the Midianite women to lure the Israelites away from the Lord. They were weeping: on account of the plague that had struck them; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/4/25/8'>8</a>."
NABRE,4,25,11,[5] My jealousy: Gods desire to maintain an exclusive hold on the allegiance of the Israelites.
NABRE,4,25,12,"[6] Covenant of peace: by means of this covenant between God and Phinehas, Phinehas can expect Gods protection, especially from any threat of reprisal for his action; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/54/10'>ISA 54:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/34/25'>EZE 34:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/37/26'>37:26</a>."
NABRE,4,25,14,"[7] 25:14-15 The noble lineage of the slain couple is mentioned in order to stress the courage of Phinehas in punishing them. The zeal of Phinehas became proverbial; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/106/30'>PS 106:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/45/23'>SIR 45:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/74/2/26'>1MA 2:26, 54</a>."

NABRE,4,26,4,[1] This introduction to the census seems to contradict vv. <a href='/NABRE/4/26/64'>64-65</a> by including those who came out of Egypt.
NABRE,4,26,12,"[2] Nemuel: so also in <a href='/NABRE/13/4/24'>1CH 4:24</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/1/46/10'>GEN 46:10</a> and <a href='/NABRE/2/6/15'>EXO 6:15</a>, a son of Simeon with the same position in the genealogy bears the name ""Jemuel""; it is uncertain which form is correct. See above, v. <a href='/NABRE/4/26/9'>9</a>, where the name ""Nemuel"" occurs for a person descended from Pallu. Some speculate this name was inserted from v. <a href='/NABRE/4/26/12'>12</a> to provide a continuing line for Pallu."
NABRE,4,26,51,"[3] 26:52-56 The division of Canaan among the various tribes and clans and families was determined not only by the size of each group but also by lot. Perhaps the lots determined the respective locality of each tribal land and the section reserved for each clan, while the relative size of the allotted locality and section depended on the numerical strength of each group. The Israelites considered the outcome of the drawing of lots as an expression of Gods will; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/8'>LEV 16:8-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/14/2'>JOS 14:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/15/1'>15:1</a>; etc.; <a href='/NABRE/44/1/23'>ACT 1:23-26</a>."

NABRE,4,27,4,"[2] 27:5-11 The purpose of this law, as also that of the related laws in <a href='/NABRE/4/36/2'>36:2-10</a> (marriage within the same tribe), <a href='/NABRE/5/25/5'>DEU 25:5-10</a> (levirate marriage), and <a href='/NABRE/3/25/10'>LEV 25:10</a> (return of property in the jubilee year), was to keep the landed property within the proper domain of each tribe."
NABRE,4,27,12,[3] The Abarim range: the mountains on the eastern side of the Dead Sea. The peak of this chain is Mount Nebo where Moses views the promised land before he dies (<a href='/NABRE/5/32/49'>DEU 32:49</a>).
NABRE,4,27,16,"[4] The God of the spirits of all humanity: the sense is that God knows the character and abilities of all people and therefore knows best whom to appoint (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/6/34'>JUG 6:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/11/29'>11:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/16/13'>1SM 16:13</a>); see the same phrase in <a href='/NABRE/4/16/22'>NUM 16:22</a>, where ""spirit"" evidently means the life principle."

NABRE,4,28,26,"[7] The day of first fruits: a unique term for this feast, which is usually called ""the feast of Weeks""; it was celebrated as a thanksgiving for the wheat harvest seven weeks after the barley harvest (Passover). In the time of Jesus it was commonly known by the Greek word ""Pentecost,"" that is, ""fiftieth"" (day after the Passover); see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/23/16'>LEV 23:16-21</a>."

NABRE,4,29,12,[4] This feast of Booths (Tabernacles or Sukkot) celebrating the vintage harvest was the most popular of all and therefore had the most elaborate ritual. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/23/34'>LEV 23:34</a>.
NABRE,4,29,13,"[5] Thirteen bulls: the number of bulls sacrificed before the octave day was seventy, arranged on a descending scale so that the number on the seventh day was the sacred number seven."
NABRE,4,29,35,"[6] A public assembly: the Hebrew word is the technical term for the closing celebration of the three major feasts of the Passover, Pentecost and Booths, or of other special feasts that lasted for a week. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/23/36'>LEV 23:36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/8'>DEU 16:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/7/9'>2CH 7:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/8/18'>NEH 8:18</a>."
NABRE,4,30,3,"[1] A vow…a pledge: here the former signifies the promise to dedicate either a person, an animal, or a thing or their equivalent to the sanctuary upon the fulfillment of some specified conditions (<a href='/NABRE/3/27/1'>LEV 27:1-13</a>); the latter signifies the assumption of either a positive or a negative obligation—that is, the promise either to do something or to abstain from something; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/4/30/14'>14</a>."
NABRE,4,30,11,[2] In her husbands house: after her marriage. This contrasts with the case given in vv. <a href='/NABRE/4/30/7'>7-9</a>.
NABRE,4,30,16,"[3] He annuls them: he prevents their fulfillment. Since he has first allowed the vows to remain valid, he can no longer annul them."
NABRE,4,31,1,"[1] 31:1-3 The narrative of Israels campaign against Midian, which was interrupted after <a href='/NABRE/4/25/18'>25:18</a>, is now resumed."
NABRE,4,31,8,"[2] The five kings of Midian: they are called Midianite princes, Sihons vassals, in <a href='/NABRE/6/13/21'>JOS 13:21</a>."
NABRE,4,31,17,[3] There are later references to Midian in <a href='/NABRE/7/6/1'>JUG 6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/7/8/1'>8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/11/18'>1KG 11:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/6'>ISA 60:6</a>. The present raid was only against those Midianites who were dwelling at this time near the encampment of the Israelites.
NABRE,4,31,23,[4] Water of purification: water mixed with the ashes of the red heifer as prescribed in <a href='/NABRE/4/19/9'>19:9</a>.
NABRE,4,31,27,"[5] Divide the spoils: for a similar division of the plunder into two equal parts, between those who engaged in the battle and those who stayed with the baggage, cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/30/24'>1SM 30:24</a>. But note that here the tax on the plunder of the noncombatants is ten times as much as that on the soldiers plunder."
NABRE,4,31,50,[6] The precise nature and use of some of these articles of gold is not certain.
NABRE,4,31,53,[7] Apparently because of the commanders generosity the common troops were under no sort of obligation to make their own offerings and could keep their loot.
NABRE,4,32,1,"[1] Gilead: the name of the western part of the plateau east of the Jordan, sometimes signifying the whole region from the Yarmuk to the Jordan, sometimes only the northern part of this region, and sometimes, as here, only its southern part. Jazer lay to the east of southern Gilead."
NABRE,4,32,3,"[2] The places named in this verse, as well as the additional ones given in vv. <a href='/NABRE/4/32/34'>34-38</a>, were all in the former kingdom of Sihon, that is, in the region between the Jabbok and the Arnon.

NABRE,4,32,20,"[4] 32:20-22 Since the ark of the Lord was carried into battle with the Israelite army, the vanguard was said to march before the Lord (see <a href='/NABRE/6/6/6'>JOS 6:6-9</a>)."
NABRE,4,32,32,"[5] This side of the Jordan: lit., ""beyond the Jordan""; the perspective in Hebrew is from the west bank looking toward the east bank where the Reubenites and Gadites finally settled."
NABRE,4,32,33,"[6] The preceding is concerned solely with the two tribes of Gad and Reuben and with the land of the former kingdom of Sihon; it seems probable that the sudden reference here to the half-tribe of Manasseh and to their territory in Bashan, the former kingdom of Og, is a later addition to the text."
NABRE,4,32,38,"[7] The phrase in parentheses is probably a gloss, warning the reader perhaps to substitute some other word for Nebo and Baal, the names of foreign deities mentioned in the last two city names. They called by their old names: lit., ""they called by their names""; however, some understand the current Hebrew text to mean, ""they called by new names,"" or ""their own names."""
NABRE,4,32,41,"[8] Havvoth-jair: that is, ""villages of Jair."""
NABRE,4,33,1,"[1] 33:1-3 According to v. <a href='/NABRE/4/33/2'>2</a>, this list of camping sites was drawn up by Moses as an itinerary recording Israels trek through the wilderness. Comparison with the more detailed accounts of the journey as given elsewhere suggests that the list is not necessarily comprehensive. It records just forty camping sites, not counting the starting place, Rameses, and the terminus, the plains of Moab. This number, which corresponds exactly to the forty years of wandering in the wilderness, is probably a schematic device. Moreover, it seems that in its present form the order of some of the names here has been disturbed. Several names listed here are not recorded elsewhere."
NABRE,4,33,30,"[2] 33:30-36 Moseroth is mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/5/10/6'>DEU 10:6</a> (in the form of ""Moserah"") as the place where Aaron died, apparently a variant of the tradition here in v. <a href='/NABRE/4/33/38'>38</a> regarding the place of Aarons death; so also <a href='/NABRE/4/20/22'>NUM 20:22-24</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/32/50'>DEU 32:50</a>. Perhaps Moseroth was close to Mount Hor."
NABRE,4,33,35,"[3] Ezion-geber: Solomon conducted sea trade with Ophir from this port (<a href='/NABRE/11/9/26'>1KG 9:26</a>), today probably identified on the northern coast of the Gulf of Elath between the Jordanian city of Aqabah and the Israeli city of Elath."
NABRE,4,33,40,"[4] The verse repeats almost verbatim the same introduction to the account of the victory over Arad as is given in <a href='/NABRE/4/21/1'>21:1-3</a>, where it also follows the account of Aarons death. Perhaps the isolated verse here is intended by the editor(s) of Numbers to point the reader to the fuller account given there."
NABRE,4,33,41,[5] 33:41b-49 It seems that this section stood originally immediately after v. <a href='/NABRE/4/33/36'>36a</a>.

NABRE,4,34,11,[3] Sea of Chinnereth: in the New Testament known as the Sea of Galilee; today called Lake Kinneret.
NABRE,4,35,8,[1] This provision was hardly observed in the actual assignment of the levitical cities as narrated in <a href='/NABRE/6/21/1'>JOS 21</a>.

NABRE,4,35,16,"[3] 35:16-25 Here, as also in <a href='/NABRE/5/19/1'>DEU 19:1-13</a>, there is a casuistic development of the original law as stated in <a href='/NABRE/2/21/12'>EXO 21:12-14</a>."
NABRE,4,36,4,"[1] Before the jubilee year various circumstances, such as divorce, could make such property revert to its original tribal owners; but in the jubilee year it became irrevocably attached to its new owners."

The Arabah: the valley of the Jordan and the depression south of the Dead Sea."
NABRE,5,1,2,"[2] Horeb: an alternative name for Mount Sinai, the wilderness mountain where the Israelites received revelation from God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/1'>EXO 3</a>; 19). Kadesh-barnea: the southern gateway to the land of Canaan, from which Moses sent spies to reconnoiter the land (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/13/26'>NUM 13:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/32/8'>32:8</a>). Seir: Edom, the land just south of Moab."

NABRE,5,1,6,"[4] 1:6-3:29 Throughout this section Moses is reviewing the events following the departure from Horeb, as a basis for the exhortation beginning in <a href='/NABRE/5/4/1'>4:1</a>. Most of these events are narrated with some variation in the Book of Numbers."
NABRE,5,1,6,[5] Horeb: the name given to the mountain of revelation in the Elohist and Deuteronomic traditions; this mountain is called Sinai in the Yahwist and Priestly traditions.
NABRE,5,1,7,"[6] The hill country of the Amorites: the central mountain range of Palestine. The Negeb: the arid land in southern Palestine. The Lebanon: the mountain range of Phoenicia, north of Palestine. This is an idealized presentation of the land the Israelites were to occupy; Israel never held power as far as the ""Great River"" (the Euphrates). The Amorites and the Canaanites were only two of several different peoples occupying the land (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/7/1'>7:1</a>)."
NABRE,5,1,28,"[7] Anakim: a people proverbially notable for height, mentioned in pre-Israelite Egyptian texts, and in the biblical tradition associated with the region of Hebron and the hill country of Judah (<a href='/NABRE/4/13/22'>NUM 13:22, 28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/4/13/33'>33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/11/21'>JOS 11:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/14/12'>14:12, 15</a>)."

NABRE,5,2,23,[2] Gaza: later a stronghold of the Philistines (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/13/3'>JOS 13:3</a>). Caphtor: the island of Crete.
NABRE,5,2,34,"[3] Under the ban: in Hebrew, herem, which means to devote to the Lord (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/7/1'>7:1-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/20/10'>20:10-18</a>). The biblical text often presents heremas the total extermination of a population as a manifestation of the will of the Lord. It is historically doubtful that Israel ever literally carried out this theological program."
NABRE,5,3,11,"[1] Bed of iron: some translate, ""a sarcophagus of basalt""; its dimensions would be approximately thirteen and a half feet by six feet."
NABRE,5,3,15,[2] Machir: a clan of the tribe of Manasseh (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/50/23'>GEN 50:23</a>).

NABRE,5,4,24,"[3] A jealous God: Hebrew el qanna. The root of the adjective qannaexpresses the idea of intense feeling focused on solicitude for someone or something; see, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/19/69/10'>PS 69:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/8/6'>SON 8:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/9/6'>ISA 9:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/37/32'>37:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/39/25'>EZE 39:25</a>. The Septuagint translated the adjective as zelotes, and the Vulgate followed suit; hence the traditional English rendering ""jealous"" (and sometimes ""zealous"") found in the Douai-Rheims and King James versions. In modern usage, however, ""jealous"" denotes unreasonable, petty possessiveness, a meaning, even as nuance, wanting in the Hebrew. In the first commandment (<a href='/NABRE/5/5/6'>5:6-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/20/2'>EXO 20:2-6</a>) and passages derived from it (like <a href='/NABRE/5/4/24'>4:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/6/15'>6:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/14'>EXO 34:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/24/19'>JOS 24:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/34/1/2'>NAH 1:2</a>), Israels God is represented as totally committed to his purpose, and Israel is put on notice to take him and his directives for their life as a people with equal seriousness."

NABRE,5,5,9,"[2] 5:9-10 Israel is confronted with a choice, to ""love"" or to ""hate"" the Lord, and with the consequences of each choice. ""Wickedness"" works destruction not only on those who do it but also down the generations, in a sort of ripple effect. Yet, if Israel keeps the commandments, they will experience the Lords hesed(""love"") down to the thousandth generation. Thus the Lords merciful love is disproportionate to the evil results of iniquity (""down to the third and fourth generation""). To the thousandth generation: lit., ""to thousands""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/7/9'>7:9</a>."

NABRE,5,6,3,"[1] 6:4-5 This passage, an expansion of the first commandment (<a href='/NABRE/5/5/6'>5:6-10</a>), contains the basic principle of the whole Mosaic law, the keynote of the Book of Deuteronomy: since the Lord alone is God, Israel must love him with an undivided heart. Jesus cited these words as ""the greatest and the first commandment,"" embracing in itself the whole law of God (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/37'>MAT 22:37-38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/12/29'>MAK 12:29-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/10/27'>LUK 10:27</a>)."

NABRE,5,6,8,"[3] Bind them…as a sign: these injunctions were probably meant merely in a figurative sense; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/13/9'>EXO 13:9, 16</a>. In the late postexilic period, they were taken quite literally, and devout Jews tied on their arms and foreheads ""phylacteries,"" boxes containing strips of parchment on which these words were inscribed; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/23/5'>MAT 23:5</a>."

NABRE,5,8,3,"[1] Not by bread alone: Deuteronomic theology puts the good things promised faithful Israel into the context of the Lords gratuitous love.

NABRE,5,14,19,"[2] 14:19-20 <a href='/NABRE/3/11/20'>LEV 11:20-23</a> suggests that the unclean winged insects are those that walk on the ground; the clean winged creatures are those that leap on the ground, such as certain species of locusts."
NABRE,5,14,21,[3] Boil a young goat in its mothers milk: the meaning of this regulation is obscure but it may have a humane concern similar to the prohibitions against slaughtering an animal and its young on the same day (<a href='/NABRE/3/22/27'>LEV 22:27-28</a>) and capturing a mother bird along with her fledgling or eggs (<a href='/NABRE/5/22/6'>DEU 22:6-7</a>).

NABRE,5,18,10,"[2] 18:10-11 Causes their son or daughter to pass through the fire: to Molech. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/18/21'>LEV 18:21</a>. Such human sacrifices are classed here with various occult and magical practices because they were believed to possess powers for averting a calamity; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/3/27'>2KG 3:27</a>. Three other categories of magic are listed here: divination of the future (by a soothsayer or augur); black magic (by a sorcerer or one who casts spells); and necromancy (by one who consults ghosts and spirits, or seeks oracles from the dead to divine the future)."
NABRE,5,18,15,[3] A prophet like me: from the context (opposition to the practices described in vv. <a href='/NABRE/5/18/10'>10-11</a>) it seems that Moses is referring in general to all the true prophets who were to succeed him. This passage came to be understood in a quasi-Messianic sense in the New Testament (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/5'>MAT 17:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/6/14'>JHN 6:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/7/40'>7:40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/22'>ACT 3:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/7/37'>7:37</a>).

NABRE,5,19,21,"[4] Life for life…: this phrasing of the lex talionismay seem exaggerated, but the law itself is meant to ensure equity and proportional punishment; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/2/21/22'>EXO 21:22-25</a>."
NABRE,5,20,15,"[1] Deuteronomy makes a distinction between treatment of nations far away and those close at hand whose abhorrent religious practices might, or did, influence Israels worship. This harsh policy was to make sure the nations nearby did not pass their practices on to Israel (cf. chap. <a href='/NABRE/5/7/1'>7</a>)."
NABRE,5,21,1,[1] 21:1-9 This law has to do with absolving the community of bloodguilt that accrues to it and to the land when a homicide occurs and the murderer cannot be identified and punished.

NABRE,5,21,22,"[6] You hang him on a tree: some understand, ""impaled on a stake."" In any case the hanging or impaling was not the means used to execute the criminal; he was first put to death by the ordinary means, stoning, and his corpse was then exposed on high as a warning for others.

NABRE,5,23,1,[1] Fathers wife: stepmother.
NABRE,5,23,2,"[2] Exclusion of an emasculated male may have had to do with association of emasculation with the practices of other peoples, or it may have been rejection of someone with a significant blemish who was thus not suitable for participation in the sacral assembly."

NABRE,5,23,18,"[4] 23:18-19 Temple prostitute: Heb. qedesha, lit., ""holy one,"" a title of the goddess of fertility. The role or function of the qedeshais debated; some see this as simply a term for a prostitute (Heb. zona). Others see it as designating a cultic role but not necessarily one involving sexual activity. The evidence is insufficient to give a final answer."
NABRE,5,23,19,"[5] Dogs pay: ""dog"" is a derogatory term for a male temple prostitute."
NABRE,5,24,1,"[1] 24:1-4 This law is directly concerned only with forbidding a divorced man from remarrying his former wife, and indirectly with checking hasty divorces, by demanding sufficient cause and certain legal formalities. Divorce itself is taken for granted and tolerated as an existing custom whose potential evils this law seeks to lessen. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/22/19'>22:19, 29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/39/2/14'>MAL 2:14-16</a>. Something indecent: a rather indefinite phrase, meaning perhaps ""immodest conduct,"" but possibly including any kind of objectionable conduct. By New Testament times Jewish opinion differed concerning what was sufficient ground for divorce; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/19/3'>MAT 19:3</a>."
NABRE,5,24,6,"[2] Since the Israelites ground their grain into flour only in sufficient quantity for their current need, to deprive a debtor of his hand mill was equivalent to condemning him to starvation."
NABRE,5,24,8,"[3] Scaly infection: the Hebrew word seems to have to do with one or more skin diseases that produce scales, such as psoriasis. Its precise meaning is uncertain. See note on <a href='/NABRE/3/13/1'>LEV 13:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/14/57'>14:57</a>."
NABRE,5,25,3,"[1] Forty lashes: while the punishment is severe, the law seeks to limit it from being overly harsh and inhumane. Later Jewish practice limited the number to thirty-nine; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/24'>2CO 11:24</a>."
NABRE,5,25,3,[2] This is comparable in spirit to <a href='/NABRE/5/22/6'>22:6-7</a>; Israelites are not to be grasping and calculating. St. Paul argues from this verse that laborers have the right to live on the fruits of their labor; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/9/9'>1CO 9:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/5/18'>1TM 5:18</a>.
NABRE,5,25,5,"[3] When brothers live together: when relatives of the same clan, though married, hold their property in common. It was only in this case that the present law was to be observed, since one of its purposes was to keep the property of the deceased within the same clan. Such a marriage of a widow with her brother-in-law is known as a ""levirate"" marriage from the Latin word levir, meaning ""a husbands brother."""
NABRE,5,25,9,"[4] 25:9-10 The penalty decreed for a man who refuses to comply with this law of family loyalty is public disgrace; the widow is to spit in his face. Some commentators connect this symbolic act with the ceremony mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/8/4/7'>RUT 4:7, 8</a>."

NABRE,5,26,14,"[2] These are allusions to foreign religious practices. To the dead: to feed the spirits of the dead, or perhaps to worship Baal."
NABRE,5,27,7,"[1] Communion sacrifices: The principal feature of this ritual (see <a href='/NABRE/3/3/1'>LEV 3:1-17</a>) is the sharing of the sacrifice with God, the priest and the person offering the sacrifice, who eat it as a holy thing (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/24/5'>EXO 24:5</a>)."
NABRE,5,27,15,"[2] 27:15-26 The ceremony described here reflects the structure of covenant. The people assent to the directives their covenant Lord sets forth; their ""Amen"" ratifies the proscription of idolatry, injustice, incest, murder, and infidelity in general. Thus the ""love"" of the Lord which is at the heart of Israels existence as his covenant people (<a href='/NABRE/5/6/4'>6:4-5</a>) is spelled out in terms of particular actions. The ""Amen"" is an acceptance of the curses or sanctions entailed by breaking faith with the Lord. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/30/15'>30:15-20</a>, a concise statement of covenant theology."

NABRE,5,33,8,[5] Thummim…Urim: devices priests used for divination (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/2/28/30'>EXO 28:30</a>).
NABRE,5,33,9,[6] The reference is probably to the Levites slaughter of other Israelites after the incident of the golden calf; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/32/27'>EXO 32:27-29</a>.
NABRE,5,33,12,[7] Abides at his breast: an image of security under divine protection.
NABRE,5,33,19,[8] The abundance of the seas: perhaps the wealth that comes from sea trade or from fishing. The hidden treasures of the sand: possibly an allusion to the valuable purple dye extracted from certain marine shells found on the coast of northern Palestine.
NABRE,5,33,24,"[9] Most blessed: Hebrew baruk; but the name Asher may suggest a play on the Hebrew ashre, ""happy""; cf., e.g., v. <a href='/NABRE/5/33/29'>29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/1/1'>PS 1:1</a>. Oil: the land of the tribe of Asher was covered with olive groves."
NABRE,6,1,2,"[1] 1:2-9 The beginning of the Book of Joshua strongly emphasizes the credentials of Joshua as Moses worthy successor (vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/1/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/6/1/3'>3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/6/1/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/6/1/7'>7</a>; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/6/1/17'>17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/3/7'>3:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/4/14'>4:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/5/15'>5:15</a>). The movement Joshua leads, whereby the Israelites take possession of the land of Canaan, is thus made continuous with the exodus from Egypt, even though (except for Joshua and Caleb) the generation that left Egypt under Moses leadership has died out (<a href='/NABRE/6/5/4'>5:4, 6</a>), and the people who will make the land of Canaan the land of Israel are a new generation. Thus the book is at pains to establish the continuity between exodus and conquest."
NABRE,6,1,4,"[2] The frontiers are as follows: in the south the wilderness of Sinai, in the north the Lebanon range, in the east the Euphrates, and in the west the Great Sea, the Mediterranean. These boundaries are ideal rather than actual."
NABRE,6,2,6,"[1] Stalks of flax spread out: to dry in the sun, after they had been soaked in water, according to the ancient process of preparing flax for linen-making. In the Near East the flax harvest occurs near the time of the feast of the Passover (<a href='/NABRE/6/4/19'>4:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/5/10'>5:10</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/9/31'>EXO 9:31</a>."
NABRE,6,2,9,"[2] 2:9-11 Rahabs speech is Deuteronomic in content and style. Through her, the author expresses a theological conviction: the Lord, the God of Israel, is God above all gods; the formation of the people Israel and its success is the Lords doing; and all the rulers of the neighboring nations do well to panic at what the Lord is doing (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/5/1'>5:1</a>). Rahab the prostitute is pointedly mentioned in the Matthean genealogy of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/5'>MAT 1:5</a>) and in <a href='/NABRE/59/2/25'>JAM 2:25</a>."
NABRE,6,2,15,[3] A house built into the city wall: the city wall formed the back wall of the house; remains of such houses have been found at ancient sites. The upper story of Rahabs house was evidently higher than the city wall. It was through the window of such a house that St. Paul escaped from Damascus; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/9/25'>ACT 9:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/11/33'>2CO 11:33</a>.
NABRE,6,3,13,"[1] Heap: Heb. nēd, the same word found in <a href='/NABRE/2/15/8'>EXO 15:8</a>; the narrative echoes the ancient Song of Miriam (<a href='/NABRE/2/15/1'>EXO 15:1-18</a>), which celebrates the crossing of the Red Sea. Thus the language provides another parallel between Joshua and Moses, conquest and exodus."
NABRE,6,3,15,"[2] Season of the harvest: toward the end of March and the beginning of April, when the barley and other crops that grew during the rainy season of winter were reaped. The crossing took place ""on the tenth day of the first month"" of the Hebrew year, which began with the first new moon after the spring equinox; cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/4/19'>4:19</a>. At this time of the year the Jordan would be swollen as a result of the winter rains and the melting snow of Mount Hermon."
NABRE,6,3,16,[3] Some scholars have suggested that this account may reflect an annual ritual reenactment of the event near the sanctuary of Gilgal.
NABRE,6,4,6,"[1] When your children ask you: reminiscent of the question and response at the Passover meal, <a href='/NABRE/2/12/26'>EXO 12:26-27</a>."
NABRE,6,4,10,"[2] 4:10-18 After the digression about the memorial stones, the author resumes the narrative by briefly repeating the story of the crossing, which had already been told in <a href='/NABRE/6/3/14'>3:14-17</a>."
NABRE,6,5,3,"[1] Gibeath-haaraloth: ""Hill of the Foreskins."""
NABRE,6,5,9,"[2] The place is called Gilgal: by popular etymology, because of the similarity of sound with the Hebrew word gallothi, ""I have removed."" Gilgal probably means ""circle,"" i.e., the place of the circle of standing stones. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/4/4'>4:4-8</a>."
NABRE,6,5,10,"[3] The month: the first month of the year, later called Nisan; see note on <a href='/NABRE/6/3/15'>3:15</a>. The crossing of the Jordan occurred, therefore, about the same time of the year as did the crossing of the Red Sea; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/12/1'>EXO 12</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/14/1'>14</a>."
NABRE,6,5,13,"[4] 5:13-6:26 The account of the siege of Jericho embraces: (1) the command of the Lord to Joshua (<a href='/NABRE/6/5/13'>5:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/6/5'>6:5</a>); (2) Joshuas instructions to the Israelites, with a brief summary of how these orders were carried out (<a href='/NABRE/6/6/6'>6:6-11</a>); (3) a description of the action on each of the first six days (<a href='/NABRE/6/6/12'>6:12-14</a>); (4) the events on the seventh day (<a href='/NABRE/6/6/15'>6:15-26</a>)."
NABRE,6,5,14,"[5] Commander: the leader of the heavenly army of the Lord of hosts is either the Lord or an angelic warrior; if the latter, he is a messenger who speaks in the person of the one who sent him. I have come: the solemn language of theophany; cf., e.g., <a href='/NABRE/19/50/3'>PS 50:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/96/13'>96:13</a>."

NABRE,6,6,20,"[2] The blowing of the horns and the shouting, features of the ritual procession with the ark of the covenant (cf. <a href='/NABRE/13/15/28'>1CH 15:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/5/11'>2CH 5:11-14</a>), are the peoples counterpart of the Lords theophany; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/7/5/4'>JUG 5:4-5</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/7/7/15'>JUG 7:15-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/13/15'>2CH 13:15</a>. The Lord gives the victory; this is the theological point of the story."
NABRE,6,6,25,[3] The genealogy of Jesus in Matthew (<a href='/NABRE/6/1/2'>1:2-16</a>) presents Rahab the prostitute as the wife of Salmon (<a href='/NABRE/6/1/5'>1:5</a>) and so the ancestor of David (<a href='/NABRE/8/4/18'>RUT 4:18-22</a>) and of Jesus.
NABRE,6,6,26,"[4] At the cost of his firstborn…its gates: this curse was fulfilled when Hiel rebuilt Jericho as a fortified city during the reign of Ahab, king of Israel; cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/16/34'>1KG 16:34</a>."
NABRE,6,7,11,"[1] Transgressed the covenant: the Hebrew word translated ""transgressed"" appears frequently in the first five chapters where it is used to describe how Israel ""crossed"" the Jordan River. There is a wordplay here to emphasize Israels responsibility to follow God to the promised land and so to obey and not transgress the divine command."
NABRE,6,7,16,[2] 7:16-18 Was designated: probably by means of the Urim and Thummim; cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/14/38'>1SM 14:38-42</a>. See note on <a href='/NABRE/2/28/30'>EXO 28:30</a>.
NABRE,6,7,26,"[3] Achor: ""misery,"" or ""disaster."" The reference is to the saying of Joshua in v. <a href='/NABRE/6/7/25'>25</a>, with an allusion also to the similar-sounding name of Achan."
NABRE,6,8,3,"[1] Thirty thousand warriors: this figure of the Hebrew text, which seems extremely high, may be due to a copyists error; some manuscripts of the Septuagint have ""three thousand,"" which is the number of the whole army in the first, unsuccessful attack (<a href='/NABRE/6/7/4'>7:4</a>); the variant reading in v. <a href='/NABRE/6/8/12'>12</a> mentions ""five thousand."" More likely, the word for ""thousand"" here and in other military contexts may designate a squad or fighting unit, itself composed of significantly fewer warriors."
NABRE,6,8,30,[2] 8:30-35 These ceremonies were prescribed in <a href='/NABRE/5/11/29'>DEU 11:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/27/2'>27:2-26</a>.
NABRE,6,9,7,"[1] The Hivites: apparently the Gibeonites belonged to this larger ethnic group (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/6/11/19'>11:19</a>), although in <a href='/NABRE/10/21/2'>2SM 21:2</a> they are classed as Amorites; both groups are listed among the seven nations of Canaan whom, according to <a href='/NABRE/5/7/1'>DEU 7:1-2</a>, the Israelites were to dispossess."
NABRE,6,9,21,[2] Hewers of wood and drawers of water: proverbial terms for those who do menial work; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/29/10'>DEU 29:10-11</a>.
NABRE,6,9,26,"[3] 9:26-27 Later on, Saul violated the immunity of the Gibeonites, but David vindicated it; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/21/1'>2SM 21:1-9</a>."
NABRE,6,10,5,[1] Hebron…Eglon: these four cities were to the south and southwest of Jerusalem.
NABRE,6,10,11,[2] Great stones from the heavens: the hailstones mentioned in the next sentence.
NABRE,6,10,13,"[3] This is recorded: the reference is to the preceding poetic passage. Evidently the Book of Jashar, like the Book of the Wars of the Lord(<a href='/NABRE/4/21/14'>NUM 21:14</a>), recounted in epic style the exploits of Israels early heroes. The sun halted: lit., ""the sun stood""; this obscure passage may suppose a longer than natural day caused when the sun stopped moving across the sky, or it may refer to the sun stopping its light-giving function, perhaps through an eclipse. In any case it was seen as a sign that God fought Israels battle (v. <a href='/NABRE/6/10/42'>42</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/14/14'>EXO 14:14</a>)."
NABRE,6,10,41,[4] Goshen: a town and its surrounding district at the southern end of the Judean mountains (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/11/16'>11:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/15/51'>15:51</a>); not to be confused with the land of Goshen in northeastern Egypt (<a href='/NABRE/1/45/10'>GEN 45:10</a>).
NABRE,6,11,1,"[1] 11:1-3 Hazor, Madon, Shimron,and Chinneroth: cities and their surrounding districts in eastern Galilee. Achshaphand Naphath-dor: southwest of Galilee. The mountain regions: in central and northern Galilee."
NABRE,6,11,5,"[2] The waters of Merom: of uncertain identification, perhaps Tel Qarnei Hittin, about seven and a half kilometers west of modern Tiberias."
NABRE,6,11,21,[3] 11:21-23 Most of the land assigned to the tribe of Judah was not conquered by it until the early period of the Judges. See note on <a href='/NABRE/7/1/1'>JUG 1:1-36</a>.
NABRE,6,11,23,[4] The land had rest from war: later passages (<a href='/NABRE/6/15/13'>15:13-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/17/12'>17:12-13</a>) show individual tribes still fighting against the remaining Canaanites. This verse forms the conclusion to the first part of the book.
NABRE,6,13,2,"[1] Geshur: not to be confused with the large Aramean district of the same name in Bashan (vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/13/11'>11-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/3/14'>DEU 3:14</a>); here it is a region to the south of the Philistine country, since vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/13/2'>2-5</a> list the unconquered lands along the coast from south to north; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/9/27/8'>1SM 27:8</a>."

NABRE,6,15,2,"[1] Salt Sea: the Dead Sea. The ""tongue,"" a prominent feature of the landscape, is a spit of land thrusting into the Dead Sea from its eastern shore; it is now called by its Arabic name, el lisân, ""tongue."""
NABRE,6,15,4,[2] Wadi of Egypt: the natural boundary between Gaza and the Sinai Peninsula.
NABRE,6,15,8,"[3] The Valley of Ben-hinnom: the southern limit of Jerusalem. Ben-hinnommeans ""son of Hinnom."" The place was also called Valley of Hinnom, in Hebrew ge-hinnom, whence the word ""Gehenna"" is derived."

NABRE,6,15,17,[5] 15:17-19 The story of Othniel is told again in <a href='/NABRE/7/1/13'>JUG 1:13-15</a>; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/7/3/9'>JUG 3:9-11</a>.
NABRE,6,15,19,"[6] 15:20-62 This elaborate list of the cities of Judah was probably taken from a document made originally for administrative purposes; the cities are divided into four provincial districts, some of which have further subdivisions. For similar lists of the cities of Judah, cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/2'>19:2-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/4/28'>1CH 4:28-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/11/25'>NEH 11:25-30</a>. This list has suffered in transmission, so that the totals given in vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/15/32'>32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/6/15/36'>36</a> are not exact; many of the cities cannot be identified."
NABRE,6,15,61,[7] In the wilderness: in the Jordan rift near the Dead Sea.
NABRE,6,16,1,"[1] 16:1-17:18 After the boundaries and cities of Judah, the most important tribe, are given, the land of the next most important group, the two Joseph tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, is described, though it was separated from Judah by the territories of Benjamin (<a href='/NABRE/6/18/11'>18:11-20</a>) and Dan (<a href='/NABRE/6/19/40'>19:40-48</a>)."
NABRE,6,16,1,[2] 16:1-3 This line formed the southern boundary of Ephraim and the northern boundaries of Benjamin and of Dan.
NABRE,6,16,5,[3] The dividing line: separating Ephraim from Manasseh. Ephraims northern border (v. <a href='/NABRE/6/16/5'>5</a>) is given in an east-to-west direction; its eastern border (vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/16/6'>6-7</a>) in a north-to-south direction.
NABRE,6,17,7,"[1] Manasseh bordered on Asher: only at the extreme northwestern section of Manassehs territory. The boundary given in the following sentences (vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/17/7'>7-10</a>) is a more detailed description of the one already mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/6/16/5'>16:5-7</a>, as separating Manasseh from Ephraim."
NABRE,6,18,12,[1] 18:12-20 Benjamins northern boundary (vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/18/12'>12-13</a>) corresponded to part of the southern boundary of Ephraim (<a href='/NABRE/6/16/1'>16:1-2</a>). Their western border (v. <a href='/NABRE/6/18/14'>14</a>) was the eastern border of Dan (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/40'>19:40-47</a>). Their southern boundary (vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/18/15'>15-19</a>) corresponded to part of the northern boundary of Judah (<a href='/NABRE/6/15/5'>15:5-9</a>).
NABRE,6,19,10,"[1] 19:10-16 Zebuluns territory was in the central section of the Jezreel Valley and of southern Galilee; it was bounded on the south by Manasseh, on the southeast by Issachar, on the northeast and north by Naphtali, and on the west by Asher. The site of the later city of Nazareth was within its borders. Bethlehem of Zebulun was, of course, distinct from the city of the same name in Judah. Twelve cities: apparently seven of the names are missing from v. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/15'>15</a>, unless some of the places mentioned in vv. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/12'>12-14</a> are to be included in the number."
NABRE,6,19,17,"[2] 19:17-23 Issachars land was on the eastern watershed of the Jezreel Valley, but also included the southeastern end of the Galilean mountains. It was surrounded by Manasseh on the south and east, by Naphtali on the north, and by Zebulun on the west. Jezreel (v. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/18'>18</a>) dominated the valley to which it gave its name, the later form of which was Esdraelon."
NABRE,6,19,24,"[3] 19:24-31 Asher inherited the western slope of the Galilean hills as far as the Mediterranean, with Manasseh to the south, Zebulun and Naphtali to the east, and Phoenicia to the north."
NABRE,6,19,32,"[4] 19:32-39 Naphtali received eastern Galilee; Asher was to the west and Zebulun and Issachar were to the south, while the upper Jordan and Mount Hermon formed the eastern border. Part of the tribe of Dan later on occupied the northern extremity of Naphtalis lands, at the sources of the Jordan (v. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/47'>47</a>)."
NABRE,6,19,40,"[5] 19:40-46 The original territory of Dan was a small enclave between Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and the Philistines."

NABRE,6,21,1,"[1] The order to establish special cities for the Levites is given in <a href='/NABRE/4/35/1'>NUM 35:1-8</a>. The forty-eight cities listed here were hardly the exclusive possession of the Levites; at least the more important of them, such as Hebron, Shechem, and Ramoth in Gilead, were certainly peopled for the most part by the tribe in whose territory they were situated. But in all these cities the Levites had special property rights which they did not possess in other cities; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/32'>LEV 25:32-34</a>."
NABRE,6,22,11,"[1] In the region of the Jordan facing the land of Canaan: on the eastern side of the Jordan valley. The river itself formed the boundary between these eastern tribes and the rest of the tribes who lived in what was formerly Canaan—though the term ""Canaan"" could also be used of both sides of the Jordan valley (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/6/22/10'>10</a>). The Transjordan tribes naturally built their altar in their own territory."
NABRE,6,22,12,"[2] To take military action against them: the western Israelites considered this altar, which seemed to violate the customary unity of the sanctuary (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/1'>LEV 17:1-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/12/4'>DEU 12:4-14</a>), as constituting rebellion against the Lord and compromising national unity."
NABRE,6,22,19,[3] Unclean: not sanctified by the tabernacle.
NABRE,6,22,20,[4] Achan…did not perish alone: his guilt caused the failure of the first attack on Ai (<a href='/NABRE/6/7/4'>7:4-23</a>); this fact is adduced as an argument for the solidarity and mutual responsibility of all the Israelites.
NABRE,6,22,22,"[5] The Lord, the God of gods: the Hebrew, which cannot be adequately rendered in English here, adds to the divine name Yhwh (""the Lord"") two synonymous words for ""God,"" eland elohim. The repetition of these three sacred words adds force to the protestations of fidelity and innocence."
NABRE,6,22,28,"[6] To witness: far from being destined to form a rival sanctuary, the copy of the altar is intended by the eastern tribes solely as a means of teaching their children to be faithful to the one true sanctuary beyond the Jordan."
NABRE,6,22,34,"[7] The name of this altar was the Hebrew word for ""witness,"" ed."

There they are to this very day."""
NABRE,6,24,32,[4] Josephs bones (<a href='/NABRE/1/50/24'>GEN 50:24-26</a>) and Jacobs purchase of the burial ground (<a href='/NABRE/1/33/18'>GEN 33:18-20</a>) relate Joshua with Genesis. A hundred pieces of money: see note on <a href='/NABRE/1/33/19'>GEN 33:19</a>.
NABRE,7,1,1,"[1] 1:1-36 The chapter depicts the Israelite settlement of Canaan as a gradual and incomplete process (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/23/29'>EXO 23:29-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/7/22'>DEU 7:22</a>). This picture contrasts sharply with that found in Joshua, where the conquest is rapid and total. Accordingly, some scholars believe that <a href='/NABRE/7/1/1'>JUG 1</a> derives from an early account, which is less idealized and more realistic than that on which Joshua is based. Others, noting that Judah is presented as the only tribe that was completely successful in driving foreigners from its territory, think that the account was written at a late date and reflects suspicion in Judah about foreign elements in the Israelite populations of outlying areas (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/24'>2KG 17:24-33</a>)."

The more common name of Moses father-in-law is Jethro, also a Midianite (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/2/3/1'>EXO 3:1</a>). It is impossible to sort out the relationships among these three men in the ancient traditions. City of Palms: Jericho (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/34/3'>DEU 34:3</a>) or a town in the Negeb."
NABRE,7,1,17,"[4] The ban…Hormah: the narrator relates the city-name ""Hormah"" to ""the ban"" (Hebrew herem), which commanded the Israelites to devote to the Lord—and thus to destroy—whatever was captured within the land (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/20/10'>DEU 20:10-18</a>)."
NABRE,7,1,18,"[5] Gaza…Ashkelon…Ekron…Ashdod: four of the five major cities of the Philistines (see note on <a href='/NABRE/7/3/3'>3:3</a>). Since these cities were on the coastal plain, the statement that Judah captured them is contrary to v. <a href='/NABRE/7/1/19'>19</a>, which notes Judahs failure to drive out the inhabitants of the lowlands. In the Septuagint the problem is removed by changing the beginning of this verse to read ""Judah did not dispossess…."""

NABRE,7,2,10,"[3] 2:10-19 This long thematic passage establishes the cyclical pattern for the stories found in the rest of the book. When the Israelites are secure, they forsake the Lord and worship other gods. In punishment the Lord places them in the power of a foreign oppressor. But when they cry out in distress, the Lord takes pity on them and raises up a judge, who delivers them from the oppressor. The Israelites remain faithful to the Lord during the lifetime of the judge, but when the judge dies they again abandon the Lord, and the cycle begins anew."
NABRE,7,2,11,"[4] The Baals: the title ""Baal,"" meaning ""lord"" or ""master,"" belonged to a large number of Canaanite, Phoenician, and Syrian deities, including especially the great storm god Hadad Baal, widely revered as lord of the earth. The plural form, which occurs here, was used by the biblical writers to refer to foreign gods in general."

By contrast, the tribes of Reuben, Gilead (elsewhere a region occupied by Reubenites and Gadites), Dan, and Asher are chided for their lack of participation.

The narrator plays on the Hebrew word ""fearful"" (hared) and the name of the spring, harod."
NABRE,7,7,5,[3] The point of this selection process is clear: the battle against the nomadic raiders is going to be won not because of the numerical superiority of the Israelite troops but because of the power of the Lord.

Much of the disputed land, which lay between the Jabbok and Arnon Rivers, was actually in Moab, and many of the details of this passage (vv. <a href='/NABRE/7/11/12'>12-28</a>) seem more applicable to a quarrel with the king of the Moabites than with the king of the Ammonites."
NABRE,7,11,30,"[2] 11:30-40 Jephthahs rash vow and its tragic consequences reflect a widespread folklore motif, most familiar in the Greek story of Iphigenia and her father, Agamemnon. The sacrifice of children was strictly forbidden by Mosaic law (<a href='/NABRE/3/18/21'>LEV 18:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/20/2'>20:2-5</a>), and when the biblical writers report its occurrence, they usually condemn it in strong terms (<a href='/NABRE/12/16/3'>2KG 16:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/21/6'>21:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>JER 7:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/19/5'>19:5</a>). In this case, however, the narrator simply records the old story, offering no comment on the acceptability of Jephthahs extreme gesture. The story may have been preserved because it provided an explanation of the custom described in vv. <a href='/NABRE/7/11/39'>39-40</a> according to which Israelite women mourned Jephthahs daughter annually in a four-day ceremony."

NABRE,7,14,4,"[1] An opportunity against the Philistines: although the story of Samsons first love might be taken as an illustration of the danger of foreign marriages, the narrator explains it differently. Samsons infatuation with the Timnite woman was the Lords way of creating an opportunity to punish the Philistines for their oppression of Israel."
NABRE,7,14,16,"[2] The story of Samson and the Timnite woman is very similar in its narrative structure to the better-known story of Samson and Delilah (<a href='/NABRE/7/16/1'>16:1-22</a>). In both, Samsons success in his conflict with the Philistines depends on keeping a secret.

NABRE,7,17,3,"[2] An idol overlaid with silver: two nouns in Hebrew, one indicating a wooden image and the other denoting an image cast from metal.

An ephod was a priestly garment, especially that worn by the high priest (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/1'>EXO 28</a> and <a href='/NABRE/2/28/39'>39</a>), which contained a pocket for objects used for divination. Teraphim were household idols (<a href='/NABRE/1/31/19'>GEN 31:19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/31/34'>34-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/19/13'>1SM 19:13</a>), which may also have had a divinatory function."

In this case the problem is cultic impropriety, seen not only in the making of an idol but in the establishment of a local temple, complete with an ephod and teraphim."
NABRE,7,17,12,"[5] 17:12-13 Previously one of Micahs sons served as priest (v. <a href='/NABRE/7/17/5'>5</a>). But Micahs family were probably Ephraimites (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/7/17/1'>1</a>) rather than Levites, and the story reflects a sense that only Levites were to be consecrated as priests; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/18/7'>NUM 18:7</a>, where descent from Aaron is further specified as a requirement to be a priest. Thus Micah believes it will be to his advantage to retain the itinerant Levite."
NABRE,7,18,1,"[1] No heritage…allotted: according to <a href='/NABRE/6/19/40'>JOS 19:40-48</a>, the Danites received an allotment in the central part of the country (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/7/13/2'>13:2</a> above). The point here may be that since they were unable to take full possession of that original allotment, as indicated by the notice in <a href='/NABRE/7/1/34'>JUG 1:34</a>, they are now seeking territory elsewhere."
NABRE,7,18,3,"[2] Recognized the voice: this might indicate that the Danite scouts were personally acquainted with the young Levite, but it is more likely to mean that, being originally from Judah, his dialect or accent was noticeably different from others in Micahs household."

NABRE,7,18,30,"[5] Micahs shrine is now reinstalled at Laish-Dan. In the time of the kings of Israel and Judah, Dan was the site of one of the two national sanctuaries of the Northern Kingdom, both of which are strongly condemned by the editors of the Books of Kings, who regarded Jerusalem as the only acceptable place for a temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/26'>1KG 12:26-30</a>). This verse draws a direct connection between Micahs temple and the later royal sanctuary at Dan. Seen in this light the account of the establishment of Micahs shrine, with its idol cast from stolen silver, becomes a highly polemical foundation story for the temple at Dan. Jonathan, son of Gershom, son of Moses: Micahs Levite is now identified as the son or descendant of Gershom, Moses eldest son (<a href='/NABRE/2/2/22'>EXO 2:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/18/3'>18:3</a>). In the traditional Hebrew text an additional letter has been suspended over the name ""Moses"" to alter it to ""Manasseh,"" thus protecting Moses from association with idol worship. Captivity: although Samaria fell in 722/721 B.C., much of the northern part of the country, probably including Dan, had been subjugated about a decade earlier by the Assyrian emperor Tilgath-pileser III."

No Benjaminite offers hospitality to the Levite and his travel party, who are obliged to wait at night in the town square until an Ephraimite residing in Gibeah welcomes them into his home."
NABRE,7,19,22,[3] 19:22-25 This part of the grim story closely parallels that of the assault on Lots angelic visitors in <a href='/NABRE/1/19/4'>GEN 19:4-8</a>.

NABRE,7,20,19,[5] 20:19-25 The Israelites are defeated twice by the Benjaminites.
NABRE,7,20,22,[6] 20:22-23 These two verses seem to be transposed. The day of supplication described in v. <a href='/NABRE/7/20/23'>23</a> must have preceded the assembly for battle reported in v. <a href='/NABRE/7/20/22'>22</a>.

In this case the sanction is imposed not because of the rules for the conquest of the promised land (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/20/10'>DEU 20:10-18</a>) but because of the failure of the men of Jabesh-gilead to honor their oath and report for the assembly.
NABRE,7,21,14,"[3] Very strong political ties existed between the people of Jabesh-gilead and the Benjaminites, especially those involving Saul, the Benjaminite king of Israel. See <a href='/NABRE/9/11/1'>1SM 11</a>, where Saul rescues Jabesh from an Ammonite siege, and <a href='/NABRE/9/31/11'>1SM 31:11-13</a>, where the people of Jabesh exert themselves to ensure that the bodies of Saul and his sons should receive honorable burial."
NABRE,7,21,22,"[4] Release them…guilt: this verse is difficult. Evidently the elders intend to make two arguments in support of their request that the men of Shiloh release their claims on the abducted women. The first argument seems to be that an insufficient number of women were taken ""in battle""—i.e., the raid on Jabesh-gilead—to provide ""a woman for every man""—i.e., a wife for every Benjaminite. The second argument is that since the women have been kidnapped, the men of Shiloh will not be guilty of having violated the oath mentioned above in <a href='/NABRE/7/21/1'>21:1, 7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/7/21/18'>18</a>."
NABRE,7,21,25,[5] See note on <a href='/NABRE/7/17/6'>17:6</a>. This final editorial comment calls attention to the chaos that followed the Benjaminite civil war and the near anarchy that characterized the various efforts to meet the need for wives for the Benjaminites.
NABRE,8,1,1,"[1] 1:1-2 Back in the time of the judges: the story looks back three generations before King David (<a href='/NABRE/8/4/17'>4:17</a>) into the time of the tribal confederation described in the Book of Judges. Davids Moabite connections are implied in <a href='/NABRE/9/22/3'>1SM 22:3-4</a>. Bethlehem of Judah: Bethlehem, a town in which part of the Judean clan-division called Ephrathah lived; cf. <a href='/NABRE/13/2/50'>1CH 2:50-51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/4/4'>4:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/5/1'>MIC 5:1</a>. <a href='/NABRE/6/19/15'>JOS 19:15</a> mentions a different Bethlehem in the north. The plateau of Moab: on the east side of the Jordan valley rift, where the hills facing west get more rain, and where agricultural conditions differ from those in Judah. Ephrathites: a reminder of Davids origins; cf. <a href='/NABRE/33/5/1'>MIC 5:1</a>."
NABRE,8,1,5,"[2] Boys: the way the storyteller chooses certain words as guides is shown here; ""boy"" will not appear again until <a href='/NABRE/8/4/16'>4:16</a>."
NABRE,8,1,6,"[3] Had seen to his peoples needs: lit., ""had visited his people."""
NABRE,8,1,8,"[4] Mothers house: the womens part of the home, but also perhaps the proper location for arranging marriage; <a href='/NABRE/22/3/4'>SON 3:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/8/2'>8:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/24/28'>GEN 24:28</a>. Kindness: Hebrew hesed. The powerful relationship term used here will recur in <a href='/NABRE/8/2/20'>2:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/8/3/10'>3:10</a>; kindness operates on both the divine-human and human-human level in Ruth."
NABRE,8,1,11,"[5] Other sons…husbands: a reference to a customary practice known from <a href='/NABRE/5/25/5'>DEU 25:5-10</a>, levirate marriage, which assigns responsibility to the brother-in-law to produce heirs in order to perpetuate the name and hold the patrimonial land of a man who died childless. How far the responsibility extended beyond blood brothers is unclear; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/38/8'>GEN 38:8</a> and the upcoming scene in <a href='/NABRE/8/4/5'>RUT 4:5-6</a>. Naomi imagines the impossible: were she to have more sons they could take Ruth and Orpah as their wives."
NABRE,8,1,16,"[6] 1:16-17 Ruths adherence to her mother-in-law in <a href='/NABRE/8/1/14'>1:14</a> is now expressed in a profound oath of loyalty, culminating in a formulary found frequently in Samuel and Kings; cf. especially <a href='/NABRE/9/20/13'>1SM 20:13</a>. Even death: burial in Naomis family tomb means that not even death will separate them."
NABRE,8,1,21,"[7] Naomis despair is made clear by her play on the meaning of her name in v. <a href='/NABRE/8/1/20'>20</a> and now by her accusation, like that in many psalms and in Job, that God has acted harshly toward her. The language belongs to the realm of judicial proceedings. By crying out in this way, the faithful Israelite opens the door to change, since the cry assumes that God hears and will do something about such seemingly unjust circumstances."
NABRE,8,1,22,"[8] Barley and wheat harvests come in succession, from as early as April-May into June-July; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/9'>DEU 16:9-12</a> suggests that the grain harvest lasts about seven weeks. The time reference leads effectively to the next episode."
NABRE,8,2,1,"[1] Kinship ties and responsibilities now become very important. Boaz is introduced as one of a group surrounding Naomi through her husbands kin who are expected to extend care. The particular term used here (moda, ""relative"") is picked up in <a href='/NABRE/8/3/2'>3:2</a>; otherwise, most of the terminology about this responsibility to care will use the vocabulary of redeeming (goel, ""redeemer"")."
NABRE,8,2,2,"[2] Israelite custom made provision for the poor, the widow, the stranger and the orphan to gather what was left behind by the harvesters, and instructed farmers not to cut to the edges of their fields, for the sake of these marginalized; <a href='/NABRE/3/19/9'>LEV 19:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/22'>23:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/24/19'>DEU 24:19-22</a>."
NABRE,8,2,4,"[3] The story brings Boaz upon the scene quickly, but he moves among his workers with the grace of a man of prominence, greeting them and being received with courtesy. The Hebrew blessing formulas used are frequent in Jewish and Christian liturgies."
NABRE,8,2,7,"[4] The verse is somewhat garbled, but the points are clear that Ruth has been appropriately deferential in seeking permission to glean, and has worked steadily since arriving. Or perhaps she has waited patiently until Boaz arrives to gain permission."
NABRE,8,2,13,"[5] Servant: only here is the language of servanthood used. Ruth has spoken with very deferential words to Boaz, but then seems to think that she has assumed too much."
NABRE,8,2,17,[6] Ephah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,8,2,20,"[7] For the first time, the story uses the Hebrew word goel, ""redeemer,"" for the responsibilities of the circle of kinship surrounding Naomi and Ruth and their deceased relatives. Involved are the recovery or retention of family land (<a href='/NABRE/3/25/25'>LEV 25:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/27/9'>27:9-33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/32/6'>JER 32:6-25</a>), release of a relative from voluntary servitude to pay debts (<a href='/NABRE/3/25/47'>LEV 25:47-55</a>), and ""redeeming blood"" or vengeance, attested in passages which regulate such vengeance. No explicit connection is made elsewhere in the Bible between marriage responsibilities and redeeming."
NABRE,8,3,2,"[1] Ruths determined action to bring relief to Naomis and her own circumstances now impels Naomi to move, using means available in Israelite custom which no one in the story has up to this point brought into play."
NABRE,8,3,4,[2] Uncover a place at his feet: Naomi advocates a course of action that will lead Boaz to act. Israelite custom and moral expectations strongly suggest that there is no loss of virtue involved in the scene.
NABRE,8,3,9,"[3] Spread the wing of your cloak: <a href='/NABRE/26/16/8'>EZE 16:8</a> makes it clear that this is a request for marriage. Ruth connects it to ""redeemer"" responsibility. A wordplay on ""wing"" links what Boaz is asked to do to what he has asked God to do for Ruth in <a href='/NABRE/8/2/12'>2:12</a>."
NABRE,8,3,11,"[4] Worthy woman: the language corresponds to the description of Boaz in <a href='/NABRE/8/2/1'>2:1</a> (lit., ""strong and worthy""); the two worthy people are linked in character to one another, as they have already proven to be in their generous behavior toward the ones in need of their care. The townspeople, lit., ""all the gate of my people,"" will ratify this at the gate in the sequel."
NABRE,8,3,12,[5] Another redeemer closer than I: Boaz knows of a closer relative who would have a prior right to buy the field and marry Ruth.
NABRE,8,4,1,[1] The gate of an Israelite town was the place where commercial and other legal matters were dealt with in publicly witnessed fashion.
NABRE,8,4,2,[2] Ten of the elders: to serve as judges in legal matters as well as witnesses of the settlement of business affairs; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/25/7'>DEU 25:7-9</a>.
NABRE,8,4,4,"[3] Although the laws governing inheritance by Israelite widows are not specified in the Bible, Naomi seems to have the right of disposal of a piece of Elimelechs land. The redemption custom in <a href='/NABRE/3/25/25'>LEV 25:25</a> would then guide the procedure."
NABRE,8,4,5,"[4] 4:5-6 Although redemption and levirate practices are not otherwise linked in the Bible, they belong in the same area of need. Boaz claims that buying Elimelechs field obligates the other redeemer to produce an heir for Mahlon, who would then inherit the land. That would jeopardize this redeemers overall holdings, since he would lose the land he had paid for. He can afford the first step but not the second, and cedes his responsibility to Boaz, who is willing to do both."
NABRE,8,4,7,"[5] Take off a sandal: the legislation in <a href='/NABRE/5/25/8'>DEU 25:8-10</a> provides that if a ""redeemer"" refuses to carry out the obligation of marrying his brothers wife, the woman shall strip off his sandal as a gesture of insult. In later years, when the obligation of carrying out this function of the ""redeemer"" was no longer keenly felt, the removal of the sandal may have become a formalized way of renouncing the rights/obligations of the ""redeemer,"" as in this text."
NABRE,8,4,12,"[6] <a href='/NABRE/1/38/1'>GEN 38</a> contains a story about Tamar similar to Ruths in levirate marriage. Judah, under less laudable circumstances, fulfills the same role as Boaz will, and Perez, son of Judah and Tamar, perpetuates the line. Thus two non-Israelite women, Tamar and Ruth, are important links in Davids genealogy."
NABRE,8,4,16,"[7] Cradled him: the child belongs to Naomi in the sense that he now becomes the redeemer in the family, as stated in <a href='/NABRE/8/4/14'>4:14</a>. This tender act by Naomi is not necessarily adoptive and differs from the relationship in <a href='/NABRE/1/30/3'>GEN 30:3</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/11/12'>NUM 11:12</a>. Naomi now has a ""boy"" to replace her two lost ""boys"" in <a href='/NABRE/8/1/5'>1:5</a>."
NABRE,9,1,6,"[1] Her rival: Hebrew sara, ""rival wife, co-wife""; in the Talmud, a technical term for a second or co-wife."
NABRE,9,1,7,"[2] In biblical narrative, the social status gained by producing children, especially males, often set woman against woman; cf. e.g., <a href='/NABRE/1/16/1'>GEN 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/21/1'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/30/1'>30</a>. Peninnahs provocations may be the arrogant boasting mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/9/2/3'>2:3</a>."
NABRE,9,1,11,"[3] No razor…: the Septuagint adds ""he shall drink neither wine nor liquor."" This addition is a further suggestion that Samuel is dedicated to God under a nazirite vow (<a href='/NABRE/4/6/4'>NUM 6:4-5</a>); see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/22'>22</a>."
NABRE,9,1,20,"[4] Samuel: Hannahs explanation associates her sons name with the narratives wordplay on the Hebrew verbs sl(""ask,"" vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/17'>17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/1/27'>27</a>), hisil(""hand over, dedicate,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/28'>28</a>), saul(""dedicated,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/28'>28</a>), and the noun seelah(""request,"" vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/17'>17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/1/27'>27</a>). The name, however, is related to the Hebrew root slonly through assonance. It means ""his name is El/God,"" not ""the one requested of or dedicated (saul) to God"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/28'>28</a>), which is the meaning of the name Saul. The author may have lifted the slwordplay from a narrative about Saul to portray Samuel as Gods gracious answer to Hannahs request."
NABRE,9,1,22,"[5] Leave him there forever: a Qumran manuscript adds ""I will give him as a nazirite forever""; it interprets v. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/11'>11</a> to mean that Hannah dedicates Samuel under a nazirite vow (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/6/4'>NUM 6:4-5</a>)."
NABRE,9,1,24,[6] Ephah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,9,2,1,"[1] 2:1-10 Hannah appeals to a God who maintains order by keeping human affairs in balance, reversing the fortunes of the arrogant, who, like Peninnah, boast of their good fortune (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/1'>1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/2/3'>3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/2/9'>9</a>) at the expense of those like Hannah who receive less from the Lord. Hannahs admission places her among the faithful who trust that God will execute justice on their behalf. The reference ""his king…his anointed"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/10'>10</a>) recalls the final sentence of the Book of Judges and introduces the kingship theme that dominates the Books of Samuel."
NABRE,9,2,3,[2] Speak…mouths: addressed to the enemies mentioned in v. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/1'>1</a>.
NABRE,9,2,18,[3] Linen ephod: not the same as the high priests ephod (<a href='/NABRE/2/28/6'>EXO 28:6-14</a>) or the ephod used in divination (v. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/28'>28</a>). Samuel wore the same kind of a ceremonial garment as the priests did (<a href='/NABRE/9/22/18'>1SM 22:18</a>). David also wore an ephod when he danced before the ark (<a href='/NABRE/10/6/14'>2SM 6:14</a>).
NABRE,9,2,22,"[4] Behaving promiscuously: this part of the verse, which recalls <a href='/NABRE/2/38/8'>EXO 38:8</a>, is a gloss; it is lacking in the oldest Greek translation, and in 4QSama."
NABRE,9,2,25,"[5] Who can intercede: Elis sons fail to understand that their crime is directly against God and that God will punish them for it. Their behavior is set in sharp contrast to Samuels, which meets with Gods approval."
NABRE,9,2,26,[6] 2:27-36 These verses describe the punishment of Eli from a point of view contemporary with the reform of Josiah (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/9'>2KG 23:9</a>; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/36'>36</a>); they hint at the events recorded in <a href='/NABRE/9/22/18'>1SM 22:18-23</a> and <a href='/NABRE/11/2/27'>1KG 2:27</a>. The older story of this divine warning occurs in <a href='/NABRE/9/3/11'>1SM 3:11-14</a>. A man of God: often an anonymous figure whose speech foreshadows events in the near future. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/9/6'>1SM 9:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/13/1'>1KG 13:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/16'>2KG 23:16-17</a>.
NABRE,9,2,28,"[7] Ephod: a portable container, presumably of cloth, for the lots used in ritual consultation of God during the days of the Judges (<a href='/NABRE/7/17/5'>JUG 17:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/18/14'>18:14-15</a>) and into the time of David (<a href='/NABRE/9/14/3'>1SM 14:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/23/6'>23:6-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/30/7'>30:7-8</a>). Attached to the ephod of the high priest described in <a href='/NABRE/2/28/6'>EXO 28:6-8</a> is a ""breastpiece of decision"" which symbolized, but did not facilitate, such consultation. The Exodus text codifies a later form of the tradition."
NABRE,9,3,2,[1] 3:2-18 The call of Samuel: This section may be divided as follows: 1. the triple summons (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/3/2'>2-9</a>); 2. Gods revelation (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/3/10'>10-14</a>); 3. Samuel informs Eli (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/3/15'>15-18</a>).
NABRE,9,3,3,[2] Not yet extinguished: referring to the nighttime setting of this narrative (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/27/20'>EXO 27:20-21</a>) and foreshadowing a permanently extinguished lamp when the ark is captured and Shiloh destroyed.
NABRE,9,3,14,[3] <a href='/NABRE/3/4/3'>LEV 4:3-12</a> presents another view: the offering of a bull can expiate priestly sin.
NABRE,9,3,17,"[4] May God do thus to you, and more: an oath formula which strengthens Elis demand by threatening divine punishment if Samuel does not obey. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/14/44'>14:44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/20/13'>20:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/25/22'>25:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/3/9'>2SM 3:9, 35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/19/14'>19:14</a>."
NABRE,9,4,1,"[1] 4:1-7:1 The Ark Narrative: A striking indication that this is an independent narrative is the absence of any mention of Samuel. The Philistines: one of the Sea Peoples, of Aegean origin, who occupied the coastal plain of Palestine and threatened the Israelites who settled the inland hills."
NABRE,9,4,4,"[2] Enthroned upon the cherubim: this divine title first occurs in the Old Testament at the sanctuary at Shiloh (cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/6/2'>2SM 6:2</a>); God is represented seated upon a throne borne through the heavens by cherubim, creatures partly human being, partly beast (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/1/1'>EZE 1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/26/1/10'>10</a>)."
NABRE,9,4,8,"[3] These mighty gods: the Philistines, who were polytheists, presume that the Israelites also honored several gods."
NABRE,9,4,10,[4] To their own tents: the defeat is so catastrophic that the soldiers abandon the army for home; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/18/17'>2SM 18:17</a>.
NABRE,9,5,1,"[1] 5:1-12 The Philistines take the ark to Dagons temple in Ashdod to confirm their victory. Their action, however, underscores Dagons impotence and the Lords power. The narrator relates the transfer of the ark from Ashdod to Gath and then Ekron as the progress of a conquering warrior king through the Philistine cities along the central plain. The Philistines humiliation recalls the climax of the Samson story (<a href='/NABRE/7/16/13'>JUG 16:13-21</a>)."
NABRE,9,5,6,"[2] Tumors: the Septuagint adds that mice, suggestive of bubonic plague, infested their fields, thus anticipating the golden mice in <a href='/NABRE/9/6/4'>6:4-5</a>. One symptom of bubonic plague is swollen lymph nodes (""tumors"")."
NABRE,9,6,3,[1] A reparation offering: an offering to make amends for unwitting transgressions against holy things or property rights; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/6/1'>LEV 6:1-3</a>.
NABRE,9,6,7,"[2] But drive their calves indoors away from them: a test to confirm the source of the Philistines trouble. Left to their instincts, milk cows would remain near their calves rather than head for the road to Beth-shemesh."
NABRE,9,6,9,[3] Beth-shemesh: a border city (about twenty-four miles west of Jerusalem) between Philistine and Israelite territory.
NABRE,9,6,18,"[4] Open villages: the plague devastated both fortified cities and villages, an indication of the Lords power over the Philistines."
NABRE,9,7,4,[1] Baals and Astartes: a Deuteronomistic phrase; cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/2/13'>JUG 2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/10/6'>10:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/12/10'>1SM 12:10</a>. Baal and Astarte were Canaanite divinities.
NABRE,9,7,6,"[2] Drew water and poured it out: this ritual act does not appear elsewhere in the Old Testament. Linked with fasting and admission of sin, it seems to function as a purification ritual that washes away the guilt incurred by worshiping the Canaanite Baal and his consort Astarte. Its effectiveness is immediately evident when the Lord thunders a response to Samuels offering."
NABRE,9,7,12,"[3] Ebenezer: ""stone of the helper,"" i.e., the Lord."
NABRE,9,7,14,"[4] The Amorites: enemies in Transjordan. Israel is now secure, safe from external and internal threat."
NABRE,9,7,16,"[5] Bethel, Gilgal and Mizpah: Bethel and Mizpah are located about five and eight miles north of Jerusalem respectively, in the district around Ramah, Samuels home. Perhaps Gilgal, which has not been definitively located, was also in this area."
NABRE,9,8,1,"[1] 8:1-22 From this chapter on, the editors of 1 Samuel provide two and sometimes three perspectives on the same event: e.g., the selection of Saul as king is recounted in chap. <a href='/NABRE/9/8/1'>8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/10/17'>10:17-24</a>; chap. <a href='/NABRE/9/12/1'>12</a>."
NABRE,9,8,15,"[2] Officials: lit., eunuchs. These high-ranking administrators were not necessarily emasculated."
NABRE,9,8,22,[3] To your own city: Samuel will later reassemble the people at Mizpah (<a href='/NABRE/9/10/17'>10:17</a>) to acclaim Saul as their king.
NABRE,9,9,8,[1] A quarter shekel of silver: about a tenth of an ounce of silver.
NABRE,9,9,12,"[2] On the high place: the local sanctuary on the top of a hill, where the sacrifice was offered and the sacrificial meal eaten."
NABRE,9,9,21,"[3] Smallest of the tribes of Israel: Sauls objection is a common element in call narrative, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/2/3/11'>EXO 3:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/4/10'>4:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/6/15'>JUG 6:15</a>."
NABRE,9,9,21,"[4] 9:22-24 At this ritual meal, Samuel treats the youthful Saul as if he were already king. Saul receives the part of the sacrificed animal reserved for the priest and his family, perhaps the sheeps fat tail. Legal texts (<a href='/NABRE/2/29/22'>EXO 29:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/3/9'>LEV 3:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/7/3'>7:3-4</a>) require the priest to burn this portion of the sheep on the altar."

NABRE,9,10,2,"[2] Here, as in <a href='/NABRE/24/31/15'>JER 31:15</a>, Rachels tomb is placed at Ramah, north of Jerusalem. Later tradition understood Ephrath (<a href='/NABRE/1/35/19'>GEN 35:19-20</a>) as Bethlehem and placed the tomb farther south (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/16'>MAT 2:16-18</a>)."
NABRE,9,10,3,[3] Oak of Tabor: or terebinth. Such a tree often indicates a shrine.
NABRE,9,10,5,"[4] The Philistine garrison: the Hebrew word for ""garrison"" has been explained alternatively to mean a stele established to mark the Philistine occupation, or an inspector or officer for the collection of taxes. Prophetic ecstasy: a condition of religious enthusiasm often induced by communal rituals of music and dancing."
NABRE,9,10,8,"[5] By inserting this verse, with its seven days, an editor has named in the very context of Sauls anointing the condition which in a later narrative will be the grounds for the rejection of the dynastic character of Sauls kingship (<a href='/NABRE/9/13/8'>13:8-15</a>)."
NABRE,9,10,10,[6] An editor has abridged a longer version of this story by omitting mention of the first two signs Samuel has given (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/10/2'>2-4</a>).
NABRE,9,10,20,"[7] Was chosen: probably by casting lots; cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/14/40'>14:40-42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/7/14'>JOS 7:14, 17</a>."

NABRE,9,11,1,"[1] A text from Qumran (1QSama) introduces this chapter with the report that Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had attacked the Gadites and the Reubenites, gouging out their right eyes. Seven thousand of them had fled to Jabesh-gilead. This additional information would explain why Nahash besieged Jabesh-gilead. There is no consensus among scholars whether the Qumran text represents an original reading or a secondary expansion."
NABRE,9,11,2,[2] Right eye of every man: thus rendering them incapable of military action.
NABRE,9,11,7,"[3] Throughout the territory of Israel: Sauls gesture summons the Israelite confederacy to a coordinated response against Nahash; cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/19/29'>JUG 19:29</a> for a similar action. Dread of the Lord: often a panic that immobilizes Israels enemies; here, however, it has the opposite effect and incites the Israelites to battle."
NABRE,9,11,8,"[4] Bezek: probably modern Khirbet Ibziq, northeast of Shechem, on the west slope of the Jordan valley, opposite Jabesh-gilead."
NABRE,9,11,12,"[5] 11:12-14 With the defeat of the Ammonites, Saul demonstrates his ability to command Israels army and defend the land. At Gilgal, Sauls kingship is ratified; ironically, he loses his kingship at the same place (<a href='/NABRE/9/13/7'>13:7</a>)."
NABRE,9,12,1,"[1] 12:1-5 Samuels upright leadership is set in sharp contrast to the despotic powers of the king described in chap. <a href='/NABRE/9/8/1'>8</a>. By their testimony, the people witness to Samuels righteousness."
NABRE,9,12,17,"[2] Harvest time for wheat: in May-June. Since this is a period of little or no rainfall in Israel, the people will not mistake the sign for a natural phenomenon."
NABRE,9,12,21,"[3] Gods who are nothing: Hebrew tohu, lit., ""emptiness,"" cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/2'>GEN 1:2</a> (…webohu); here, idols without power or substance, as in <a href='/NABRE/23/41/29'>ISA 41:29</a>."
NABRE,9,12,22,"[4] His own great name: were the Lord to abandon his people, even if they abandon him, he would diminish his stature or reputation in the divine council or among the nations (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/26/20/9'>EZE 20:9</a>). Throughout the Old Testament the Lord is encouraged to deliver Israel, despite its evil, ""for the sake of his name."""
NABRE,9,13,1,"[1] A formula like that of <a href='/NABRE/10/5/4'>2SM 5:4</a> was introduced here at some time; but the age of Saul when he became king remains a blank, and the two years assigned for his reign in the Masoretic text cannot be correct. <a href='/NABRE/44/13/21'>ACT 13:21</a> offers the round number of forty years."
NABRE,9,13,3,"[2] 13:3-4 The Philistine garrison: see note on <a href='/NABRE/9/10/5'>10:5</a>. Let the Hebrews hear: a different reading of these verses, based on the Greek, would yield: ""And the Philistines heard that the Hebrews (or: the slaves) had revolted. Saul in the meantime sounded the trumpet throughout all the land (v. <a href='/NABRE/9/13/4'>4</a>), and all Israel heard that Saul…."""
NABRE,9,13,5,"[3] Thirty thousand chariots: some Greek manuscripts read ""three thousand chariots."""
NABRE,9,13,7,"[4] 13:7-15 These verses, like <a href='/NABRE/9/10/8'>10:8</a>, anticipate the rejection of Saul; a different occasion and motivation for this are given in chap. <a href='/NABRE/9/15/1'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/28/17'>28:17-18</a>."
NABRE,9,13,14,"[5] After his own heart: i.e., of his choosing, for his purpose. While the verse undoubtedly refers to David, it concerns the Lords decision to continue the kingship, even though he has rejected Saul, by selecting the heir to Sauls throne."
NABRE,9,13,18,"[6] 13:19-22 These details emphasize the Philistines military power and superior technology, a reminder that an Israelite victory depends on God."
NABRE,9,14,10,[1] That will be our sign: Jonathan acknowledges that the battle is in Gods hands.
NABRE,9,14,11,"[2] Hebrews: while this term is often used by foreigners of Israelites, in this verse it seems to be a derogatory epithet for soldiers who deserted Sauls army while he was waiting for Samuel to arrive in Gilgal."
NABRE,9,14,15,"[3] Awesome shuddering: lit., ""shuddering caused by God""; the panic in the Philistine camp is the work of Israels warrior God."
NABRE,9,14,23,[4] The victory apparently cleared the Philistines off the main ridge of mountains in the territories of Benjamin and Ephraim.
NABRE,9,14,41,"[5] Urim…Thummim: objects, one representing a positive response and the other a negative response, kept in the front pocket of the priests ephod, a garment worn as a breastplate, and used to ascertain Gods will in certain instances, e.g., whether Saul should help rout the Philistines. Saul consults the priest but is too impatient to finish the consultation and hurries impulsively into battle."
NABRE,9,14,45,"[6] Rescued: the Hebrew word used is that for the ""redemption"" of the firstborn (<a href='/NABRE/2/13/13'>EXO 13:13-15</a>)."
NABRE,9,15,3,"[1] Put under the ban: this terminology mandates that all traces of the Amalekites (people, cities, animals, etc.) be exterminated. No plunder could be seized for personal use. In the light of <a href='/NABRE/5/20/16'>DEU 20:16-18</a>, this injunction would eliminate any tendency toward syncretism. The focus of this chapter is that Saul fails to execute this order."
NABRE,9,15,4,[2] The numbers here are not realistic; compare <a href='/NABRE/9/14/2'>14:2</a>.
NABRE,9,15,6,[3] The Kenites honored the terms of an alliance with Israel.
NABRE,9,15,22,"[4] Samuels reprimand echoes that of the prophets. Cultic practice is meaningless, even hypocritical, unless accompanied by an attentiveness to Gods will."
NABRE,9,15,29,"[5] Nor repents: the apparent contradiction between this verse and vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/15/11'>11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/15/35'>35</a> leads some scholars to consider it a gloss (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/23/19'>NUM 23:19</a>). However, this phrase can be understood to underscore the definitive character of Samuels declaration that Saul has lost the kingship."
NABRE,9,16,1,"[1] David is anointed two more times after Sauls death (<a href='/NABRE/10/2/4'>2SM 2:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/5/3'>5:3</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/9/17/28'>17:28</a>, his brother Eliab is not aware of Davids selection. These repetitions and inconsistencies reflect the final editors use of multiple sources."
NABRE,9,16,14,"[2] 16:14-23 These verses explain Sauls loss of divine favor and Davids rise to power. By approving the young man, Saul identifies David as his legitimate successor. Of the two traditions in the Hebrew text about Davids entry into Sauls service, the Greek translation retains only the one found in vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/16/14'>14-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/17/1'>17:1-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/17/32'>32-54</a>. An evil spirit from the Lord: Sauls erratic behavior is attributed to a change in the Lords relationship with him. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/9/23'>JUG 9:23</a>, where the Lord puts an evil spirit between Abimelech and the citizens of Shechem."
NABRE,9,17,4,"[1] Six cubits and a span: about nine feet nine inches (a cubit equals about eighteen inches; a span equals about eight inches). The Greek text and 4QSamaread: ""four cubits and a span"" (six feet nine inches). The description of the Philistines might and his powerful weapons contrasts with the picture of the youthful David who trusts in God."
NABRE,9,17,7,[2] Six hundred shekels: over fifteen pounds.
NABRE,9,17,11,"[3] 17:12-31 Here the final editor begins an alternative account of Davids encounter with the Philistine hero, which continues in vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/17/50'>50-51</a> and concludes in <a href='/NABRE/9/17/55'>17:55</a>-<a href='/NABRE/9/18/5'>18:5</a>."
NABRE,9,17,41,[4] 17:41-47 The two combatants trade theological taunts. God uses the most unlikely opponent to destroy Goliath.
NABRE,9,17,54,"[5] Jerusalem was a Jebusite city; it came under Israelite control only at the beginning of Davids rule. As a young shepherd, David would not have had a military tent. In <a href='/NABRE/9/21/10'>21:10</a>, Goliaths sword is in the Nob temple."
NABRE,9,18,4,"[1] Jonathan took off: with the details in this verse, the narrator identifies David as Jonathans replacement and Sauls heir to the throne. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/23/17'>23:17</a> and <a href='/NABRE/1/41/39'>GEN 41:39-43</a>."
NABRE,9,18,6,"[2] Stringed instruments: perhaps a lute-like instrument with three strings; the Hebrew word, shalshim, perhaps related to the root shlsh(""three""), occurs only here in the Old Testament."
NABRE,9,18,16,"[3] Led them on their expeditions: lit., ""go out and come in,"" i.e., through the city gates; an idiom for military victory."
NABRE,9,19,4,[1] Jonathan reminds Saul that David has served him loyally and done nothing to earn a traitors death. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/24/18'>24:18-20</a>.
NABRE,9,19,11,"[2] This story may have originally followed <a href='/NABRE/9/18/29'>18:29</a>, placing the episode of Davids escape on the night of his marriage with Michal."
NABRE,9,19,13,"[3] Teraphim: a life-sized image of a household god in human form; cf. also note on <a href='/NABRE/1/31/19'>GEN 31:19</a>. Elsewhere in the Deuteronomistic History, use of teraphim is condemned (<a href='/NABRE/9/15/23'>15:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/24'>2KG 23:24</a>)."
NABRE,9,19,18,"[4] Naioth: meaning ""the pastures."" This place appears only in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/9/19/1'>19</a>-<a href='/NABRE/9/20/1'>20</a> and is associated with Ramah."
NABRE,9,19,24,"[5] In the presence of Samuel: this verse, which disagrees with <a href='/NABRE/9/15/35'>15:35</a>, is further evidence of the diverse origins of these accounts. ""Is Saul also among the prophets?"": although similar to the story of Sauls prophetic ecstasy in <a href='/NABRE/9/10/10'>10:10-13</a>, this account offers a more disparaging portrait of Saul."
NABRE,9,20,13,[1] See note on <a href='/NABRE/9/3/17'>3:17</a>.
NABRE,9,20,26,"[2] The meal on the first day of the month would have had religious overtones, and a ritual impurity (<a href='/NABRE/3/15/16'>LEV 15:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/23/10'>DEU 23:10-12</a>) would have barred David from sharing in it."
NABRE,9,20,31,[3] Your claim to the kingship: Saul admits his intention that Jonathan should succeed him and that David is a threat to his lineage (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/23/17'>23:17</a>). However Jonathan has already acknowledged Davids kingship (<a href='/NABRE/9/18/3'>18:3-4</a>) and his own subservient role (<a href='/NABRE/9/20/13'>20:13-16</a>).
NABRE,9,21,2,[1] Ahimelech realizes that he risks incurring Sauls anger if David has come to Nob as a fugitive.
NABRE,9,21,5,"[2] 21:5-6 According to <a href='/NABRE/3/24/5'>LEV 24:5-9</a>, the showbread consisted of twelve loaves that were replaced each sabbath. Since the old bread was to be consumed by the priests, Ahimelech questions David regarding the ritual purity of his men (see <a href='/NABRE/10/11/11'>2SM 11:11</a>). Davids answer supposes the discipline of a military campaign under the conditions of ""holy war"" (<a href='/NABRE/5/23/10'>DEU 23:10-15</a>)."
NABRE,9,21,8,"[3] Detained before the Lord: perhaps to fulfill a ritual obligation. Davids arrival at Nob seems to coincide with a festival day, since the showbread has recently been replaced with fresh bread. Shepherds: i.e., Sauls palace guard. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/22/9'>22:9-10</a>, where Doeg has easy access to Saul."
NABRE,9,21,10,[4] Ephod: here an object or image large enough to conceal Goliaths sword. Cf. Gideons ephod in <a href='/NABRE/7/8/27'>JUG 8:27</a>.
NABRE,9,21,13,"[5] Gath: a Philistine city (see note on <a href='/NABRE/9/5/1'>5:1-12</a>), the home of Goliath."
NABRE,9,22,2,"[1] Embittered: Hebrew mar-nephesh, ""bitter of spirit,"" used of Hannah, deprived of a child, in <a href='/NABRE/9/1/10'>1:10</a>, and of Davids soldiers, whose women and children the Amalekites had seized (<a href='/NABRE/9/30/6'>30:6</a>). Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/10/17/8'>2SM 17:8</a>. David becomes a hero for those who have endured loss or deprivation."
NABRE,9,22,4,[2] 22:4-5 Stronghold: seemingly connected with the cave complex in v. <a href='/NABRE/9/22/1'>1</a>.
NABRE,9,22,20,"[3] Abiathar: the sole survivor of Elis household (<a href='/NABRE/9/2/27'>2:27-36</a>). David now has in his service the only priest of the Lord left in the land and exclusive access to the ephod for consulting the Lord (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/23/9'>23:9-13</a>). David later appoints Abiathar co-high priest with Zadok in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/10/20/25'>2SM 20:25</a>), but Solomon exiles Abiathar to Anathoth when the priest does not support his bid for the throne. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/2/26'>1KG 2:26-27</a>."
NABRE,9,22,23,"[4] You are under my protection: once again a sharp contrast is drawn between Saul, who kills the Lords priests, and David, who protects the lone survivor."
NABRE,9,23,17,"[1] King of Israel: to emphasize the inevitability of the Lords plan, the narrator frames Jonathans statement with two accounts of Davids mercy toward Saul."
NABRE,9,24,1,"[1] The first of two accounts (see chap. <a href='/NABRE/9/26/1'>26</a>) in which David spares Sauls life. The two accounts, which do not make reference to each other, are probably alternative versions of the same story."
NABRE,9,25,8,"[1] Your son David: this kinship language may reflect a political or social relationship between Nabal and David. Nabal, however, does not acknowledge it."
NABRE,9,25,25,"[2] Hebrew nabalmeans ""fool"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/32/5'>ISA 32:5-7</a>). Abigail, on the other hand, acts wisely to save herself and her household by offering prudent counsel to the future king of Israel."
NABRE,9,25,26,"[3] Abigail, encouraging David to trust in Gods promise, anticipates that some misfortune will shortly overtake Nabal, as in fact it does (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/25/37'>37-38</a>)."
NABRE,9,25,29,"[4] The bundle of the living: the figure is perhaps taken from the practice of tying up valuables in a kerchief or bag for safekeeping. Abigail desires that David enjoy permanent peace and security, but that his enemies be subject to constant agitation and humiliation like a stone whirled about, cast out of the sling, and thereafter disregarded."
NABRE,9,26,1,[1] The second account of David sparing Sauls life; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/9/24/1'>24:1</a>.
NABRE,9,26,10,"[2] Perishes in battle: Davids words foreshadow how Saul will die (<a href='/NABRE/9/31/3'>31:3-4</a>). They also emphasize that David, unlike Saul, knows his proper place before God. David comes to the kingship innocent of Sauls blood, although the king pursues him like an enemy and David has had two opportunities to kill him."
NABRE,9,26,12,[3] Deep slumber: as in <a href='/NABRE/1/2/21'>GEN 2:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/15/12'>15:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/29/10'>ISA 29:10</a>. The Lord aids Davids foray into Sauls camp and allows David to come and go undetected.
NABRE,9,26,17,"[4] David my son: Sauls reference to David as his son, which appears three times in this chapter (vv. <a href='/NABRE/9/26/17'>17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/26/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/9/26/25'>25</a>), alludes to Davids role as his successor."
NABRE,9,26,19,"[5] The Lords heritage: the land and people of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/5/32/8'>DEU 32:8-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/33/12'>PS 33:12</a>). If driven from the land, David could not take part in worship of Israels God; nonetheless, God has blessed David (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/9/26/25'>25</a>)."
NABRE,9,26,20,"[6] Partridge: lit., ""the caller."" The metaphor is built on clever wordplay: in v. <a href='/NABRE/9/26/14'>14</a>, David calls out to the army and Abner asks the callers identity. David calls out the answer: ""the caller"" is the object of the kings pursuit."
NABRE,9,27,6,[1] Ziklag was a royal city and not part of Israels tribal land holdings. Jerusalem later enjoyed a similar status (<a href='/NABRE/10/5/7'>2SM 5:7-9</a>).
NABRE,9,27,10,[2] The Negeb of Judah: David deceives Achish by assuring him that he has attacked Israelite territory.
NABRE,9,28,1,[1] You and your warriors: David is faced with a potentially dangerous dilemma: either to reveal his continuing loyalty to his own people or to obey Achish and fight against his own people.
NABRE,9,28,7,"[2] A medium: Sauls own prohibition of necromancy and divination (v. <a href='/NABRE/9/28/3'>3</a>) was in keeping with the consistent teaching of the Old Testament (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/19/31'>LEV 19:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/20/6'>20:6, 27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/18/10'>DEU 18:10</a>)."
NABRE,9,28,15,[3] 28:15-19 The consultation with the medium serves to remind the reader that the Lords plan for David marches onward; no sorcery can thwart it.
NABRE,9,30,26,[1] Elders of Judah: David consolidates his power in southern Judah in preparation for his anointing at Hebron (<a href='/NABRE/10/5/3'>2SM 5:3</a>).
NABRE,9,31,12,[1] Burned them: cremation was not an Israelite custom. The people of Jabesh-gilead repay Sauls victory over the Ammonites on their behalf (chap. <a href='/NABRE/9/11/1'>11</a>) by providing burial and funeral rites for him and his sons. Probably the damaged state of the corpus necessitated cremation.
NABRE,10,1,21,"[1] Surging from the deeps: this conjectural reading of the Hebrew yields a parallelism with dew and rain: the mountains where the warriors have fallen in battle are to be desiccated, deprived of water from above (rain, dew) and below (the primordial deeps)."
NABRE,10,1,22,"[2] Unstained: lit., ""empty."" The sword was conceived as a devouring mouth; see, e.g., 2:26."
NABRE,10,2,8,"[1] Ishbaal: here and elsewhere in the Hebrew text, his name appears as ""Ishbosheth""; the second part of Ishbaal, -baal, refers to the Canaanite god Baal, and is therefore suppressed, replaced by bosheth, ""shame."""
NABRE,10,2,14,"[2] Perform: lit., ""play."""
NABRE,10,2,16,"[3] The nature of this gruesome game is not clear, and the place name is variously given in the older texts."
NABRE,10,3,7,[1] Asserting a right to the late kings harem was tantamount to claiming his kingship; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/16/21'>16:21-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/2/21'>1KG 2:21-22</a>.
NABRE,10,3,29,"[2] An assortment of imprecations, consisting of physical ailments, weakness, violent death, and poverty."
NABRE,10,4,4,"[1] Meribbaal: Hebrew has mephiboseth; see note on <a href='/NABRE/10/2/8'>2:8</a>. His name, in fact, is Meribbaal; cf. <a href='/NABRE/13/8/34'>1CH 8:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/9/40'>9:40</a>. He is the subject of chap. <a href='/NABRE/10/9/1'>9</a> below. The text of this verse may owe its present place to the fact that ancient copies of the Books of Samuel tended to confuse his name with that of his uncle Ishbaal, Sauls son and successor, a principal figure in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/10/2/1'>2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/10/4/1'>4</a>."
NABRE,10,5,5,"[1] 5:6-12 Davids most important military exploit, the taking of Jerusalem, is here presented before his battles with the Philistines, vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/5/17'>17-25</a>, which took place earlier. The sense of vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/5/6'>6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/5/8'>8</a> is in doubt. Perhaps the Jebusites boasted that Jerusalem was impregnable, using a metaphorical or proverbial expression that claimed the city was defensible even by people not suited for military action. The saying then received a different sense (v. <a href='/NABRE/10/5/8'>8</a>), to the effect that ""the blind and the lame"" were Davids enemies. <a href='/NABRE/40/21/14'>MAT 21:14</a> and <a href='/NABRE/42/14/13'>LUK 14:13</a> seem to play off, and transform, this saying."
NABRE,10,5,12,"[2] David now knew: Hirams carpenters and masons built David a house of cedar, the very model of a Canaanite kings palace. This house then represented the consolidation of Davids royal power, in the Canaanite mode, with Jerusalem as Davids personal fiefdom and capital city."
NABRE,10,5,17,[3] Refuge: probably near Adullam (<a href='/NABRE/9/22/1'>1SM 22:1-5</a>).
NABRE,10,5,18,"[4] 5:18-25 The successive defeats of the Philistines in the valley of Rephaim southwest of Jerusalem had the effect of blocking their access to the mountain ridge near Gibeon, and confining them to their holdings on the coast and in the foothills beyond Gezer to the west and south."
NABRE,10,5,20,"[5] Baal-perazim: here the title baal, ""master, lord,"" refers to the Lord; perazimis the plural of perez, which means ""breaking"" or ""bursting,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/10/6/8'>6:8</a>."
NABRE,10,5,24,[6] Sound of marching: the wind in the treetops suggestive of the footsteps of the Lord and the heavenly host.
NABRE,10,6,8,"[1] Perez-uzzah: this Hebrew phrase means ""the breaking out against Uzzah""; see note on <a href='/NABRE/10/5/20'>5:20</a>."
NABRE,10,6,14,"[2] Girt with a linen ephod: the ephod was some sort of priestly vestment (probably like an apron); cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/4'>EXO 28:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/17/5'>JUG 17:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/2/18'>1SM 2:18, 28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/14/3'>14:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/22/18'>22:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/23/6'>23:6</a>. The cultic procession that accompanies the ark to the holy mountain, Zion, is led by King David, dancing ecstatically and wearing a priestly vestment."
NABRE,10,6,20,"[3] 6:20-23 Michals reaction to Davids dancing comes from her conception of how a king should comport himself. David rejects this understanding, saying he needs no instruction from the house of the failed king, Saul."
NABRE,10,7,8,"[1] 7:8-16 The message Nathan delivers to David, called the Dynastic Oracle, is prompted by Davids intention to build a house (i.e., a temple) for the Lord, like Davids own house (i.e., palace) of cedar. David is told, in effect, not to bother building a house for the Lord; rather, the Lord will make a house for him—a dynasty, the House of David. Not only will he have descendants (v. <a href='/NABRE/10/7/12'>12</a>) who will sit upon the throne of Israel (v. <a href='/NABRE/10/7/13'>13</a>), their rule will last forever (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/7/13'>13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/7/16'>16</a>); and even if they transgress the Lords commands, the line of David will never be removed from kingship as Saul was (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/13/1'>1SM 13</a>; 15). The oracle establishes the Davidic king as standing in relationship to the Lord as a son to a father (v. <a href='/NABRE/10/7/14'>14</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/2/7'>PS 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/27'>89:27</a>). The Dynastic Oracle, with cognate texts in the Scriptures, is the basis for Jewish expectations of an anointed king (<a href='/NABRE/9/12/3'>1SM 12:3, 5</a>), son of David (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/9'>MAT 21:9</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/2/30'>ACT 2:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/1/5'>HEB 1:5</a>."
NABRE,10,7,13,"[2] He it is: Solomon, in the event."
NABRE,10,7,16,"[3] The unconditional promise made here, and reflected in <a href='/NABRE/19/89/34'>PS 89:34-35</a>, stands in contrast to the tradition in <a href='/NABRE/19/132/12'>PS 132:12</a>, where the continuation of the line of David depends on their fidelity to the Lord; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/11/2/4'>1KG 2:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/6/12'>6:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/8/25'>8:25</a>."
NABRE,10,7,20,"[4] Know: give recognition, choose, single out: cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/18/19'>GEN 18:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/33/12'>EXO 33:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/3/2'>AMO 3:2</a>."
NABRE,10,8,1,"[1] David took…: the original Hebrew seems irretrievable. The transmitted text gives ""the bridle of the cubit""; <a href='/NABRE/13/18/1'>1CH 18:1</a> understood ""Gath and its towns""; others implausibly read ""dominion of the capital city."""
NABRE,10,8,2,"[2] Two lengths…a full length for life: usually taken to mean that two-thirds of them were executed; but it could mean that two-thirds were spared, if the line was used full length in their case but doubled on itself to make ""two lines"" for those to be put to death.

NABRE,10,8,17,"[4] Zadok…Ahimelech, son of Abiathar, were priests: the names of Abiathar and Ahimelech are frequently associated with David (<a href='/NABRE/9/22/20'>1SM 22:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/23/6'>23:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/30/7'>30:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/15/24'>2SM 15:24, 29</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/15/35'>35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/17/15'>17:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/19/12'>19:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/20/25'>20:25</a>), but they show Abiathar acting as priest, not Ahimelech: Abiathar shared the priestly office with Zadok in Davids reign and even during Solomons early years (<a href='/NABRE/11/2/26'>1KG 2:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/4/4'>4:4</a>). Ahimelech was the name of Abiathars father. This verse and <a href='/NABRE/13/18/16'>1CH 18:16</a> may indicate that Abiathar had a son named Ahimelech who also acted as a priest, like his father and his namesake grandfather, in the last years of David."

NABRE,10,11,22,"[2] 11:22-24 In these verses the Greek text has David, angry with Joab, repeat exactly the questions Joab had foreseen in vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/11/20'>20-21</a>. In v. <a href='/NABRE/10/11/24'>24</a> of our oldest Greek text, the messenger specifies that about eighteen men were killed. The Greek is considerably longer than the transmitted Hebrew text, suggesting that the Hebrew may have lost some sentences."
NABRE,10,12,1,"[1] 12:1-7 David has committed adultery with Bathsheba and arranged the death of her husband. Instead of directly indicting the king for this criminal abuse of his royal authority, the prophet Nathan tells David a story. In the story, a parable of Davids own actions, a powerful man takes cruel advantage of his vulnerable neighbor. Hearing the story, David is outraged and denounces the rich man—thus unwittingly pronouncing judgment on himself (""You are the man,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/10/12/7'>7</a>)."

NABRE,10,20,8,[1] The text of this verse is quite uncertain.
NABRE,10,20,18,[2] 20:18-19 This proverbial expression is obscure but seems to reflect a tradition that this Danite town was associated with oracles or other sorts of revelation.

NABRE,10,22,1,"[1] 22:1-51 This psalm of thanksgiving also appears in the Psalter, with a few small variants, as <a href='/NABRE/19/18/1'>PS 18</a>. In both places it is attributed to David. Two main sections can be distinguished. In the first part, after an introductory stanza of praise to God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/2'>2-4</a>), the writer describes the peril he was in (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/5'>5-7</a>), and then poetically depicts, under the form of a theophany, Gods intervention in his behalf (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/8'>8-20</a>), concluding with an acknowledgment of Gods justice (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/21'>21-31</a>). In the second part, God is praised for having prepared the psalmist for war (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/32'>32-35</a>), given him victory over his enemies (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/36'>36-39</a>), whom he put to flight (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/40'>40-43</a>), and bestowed on him dominion over many peoples (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/44'>44-46</a>).

NABRE,10,22,11,"[6] Mounted on a cherub: in the traditional storm theophany, as here, the Lord appears with thunder, lightning, earthquake, rain, darkness, cloud, and wind. Sometimes these are represented as his retinue; sometimes he is said to ride upon the clouds or ""the wings of the wind"" (<a href='/NABRE/19/104/3'>PS 104:3</a>). The parallelism in v. <a href='/NABRE/10/22/11'>11</a> suggests that the winged creatures called cherubim are imagined as bearing the Lord aloft. In the iconography of the ark of the covenant, the Lord was ""enthroned upon the cherubim""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/37/7'>EXO 37:7-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/4/4'>1SM 4:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/6/2'>2SM 6:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/19/15'>2KG 19:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/80/2'>PS 80:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/99/1'>99:1</a>."

Then comes the story of a daring adventure by three unnamed members of the larger group of the Thirty (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/23/13'>13-17</a>). Next come the commanders of the kings bodyguard, Abishai (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/23/18'>18-19</a>) and Benaiah (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/23/20'>20-23</a>), with whom must be counted Asahel (v. <a href='/NABRE/10/23/24'>24</a>) and Joab (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/23/18'>18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/23/24'>24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/23/37'>37</a>), and finally the group of the Thirty (vv. <a href='/NABRE/10/23/24'>24-39</a>)."
NABRE,10,23,16,[3] Poured it out: as a libation.
NABRE,10,24,10,"[1] The narrative supposes that since the people belonged to the Lord rather than to the king, only the Lord should know their exact number. Further, since such an exact numbering of the people would make it possible for the king to exercise centralized power, imposing taxation, conscription, and expropriation upon Israel, the story shares the view of monarchy found in <a href='/NABRE/9/8/4'>1SM 8:4-18</a>. See also <a href='/NABRE/4/3/44'>NUM 3:44-51</a>, where census taking requires an apotropaic offering."
NABRE,11,1,1,"[1] 1:1-11:43 The story of the reign of Solomon comprises twelve major units, organized concentrically. That is, the first unit (<a href='/NABRE/11/1/1'>1:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/2/12'>2:12</a>a) balances the last (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/26'>11:26-43</a>), the second (<a href='/NABRE/11/2/12'>2:12</a>b-46) balances the second last (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/14'>11:14-25</a>), and so forth. (See the structural notes at the beginning of each major unit.) The center of the whole story is a diptych that narrates the construction of the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/1'>6:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/7/51'>7:51</a>) and its dedication (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/1'>8:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/9/10'>9:10</a>)."
NABRE,11,1,1,"[2] 1:1-2:12a The first major unit of the Solomon story concludes the so-called Succession Narrative (<a href='/NABRE/10/9/1'>2SM 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/10/20/1'>20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/1/1'>1KG 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/2/1'>2</a>). This unit tells how Solomon, a younger son, came to succeed David on the throne of Israel through the intervention of the prophet Nathan. Compare the last unit of the Solomon story, 11:26-43, where the prophet Ahijah begins the process whereby Jeroboam becomes king of the northern tribes after Solomons death. The story of Solomons accession is itself concentrically arranged: Davids decline, Adonijahs rise, Solomons supporters, Davids decision, Solomons inauguration, Adonijahs fall, Davids death. Chronicles has no developed parallel to this story (see <a href='/NABRE/13/23/1'>1CH 23:1</a>)."
NABRE,11,1,2,[3] The fulsome use of royal titles and the elaborate etiquette in the Succession Narrative suggest the raw ambition of the contending parties and the oppressive atmosphere of the court.
NABRE,11,1,9,[4] En-rogel: the modern Jobs Well just southeast of Jerusalem. It marked the ancient boundary between the tribes of Benjamin and Judah (<a href='/NABRE/6/15/7'>JOS 15:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/18/16'>18:16</a>).
NABRE,11,1,15,"[5] Entering the kings chambers, Bathsheba confronts two realities: he is very old; and she herself, the woman for whom David once committed adultery and murder, has been replaced at the kings side and in his bed."
NABRE,11,1,16,"[6] Throughout <a href='/NABRE/11/1/1'>1KG 1</a> the key question is ""Who shall be king (malak)?"" Davids feeble, two-syllable question to Bathsheba is an ironic echo of that key word: ""What do you wish?"" renders the Heb. mahlak?"
NABRE,11,1,18,"[7] Bathsheba uses a clever wordplay to conceal the rivalry between Solomon and Adonijah and imply that the real rivalry is between David and Adonijah. She repeatedly addresses David as ""my lord king"" (adoni hammelek), but claims that ""Adonijah has become king"" (adoniya malak). Know: the term means both ""be aware of"" and ""recognize, acknowledge, ratify."""
NABRE,11,1,20,[8] There was no precedent for determining succession to the throne of Israel. Adonijah and his supporters assumed that primogeniture would assure the succession as it did in the monarchies of the surrounding nations. But Bathsheba persuades David that he is free to name anyone he chooses.
NABRE,11,1,38,[9] Cherethites and Pelethites: mercenaries in Davids bodyguard. They became part of his retinue after he defeated the Philistines and established himself in Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/8/18'>2SM 8:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/15/18'>15:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/20/23'>20:23</a>.
NABRE,11,1,43,"[10] Hardly: Jonathans first word, abal, whose meaning (such as ""indeed,"" ""on the contrary"") must be discerned from the context, may be ironic. This irony is deepened by an untranslatable wordplay in Hebrew: a very similar word means ""to mourn,"" which is an appropriate comment about the death of Adonijahs hopes for the throne."
NABRE,11,1,50,[11] Horns of the altar: the protuberances on each of the four corners of the altar (<a href='/NABRE/2/27/2'>EXO 27:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/29/12'>29:12</a>). By grasping the horns of the altar Adonijah is claiming asylum (<a href='/NABRE/2/21/13'>EXO 21:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/2/28'>1KG 2:28</a>).
NABRE,11,2,5,"[1] 2:5-9 David urges Solomon to purge Joab and Shimei and supplies him with justification for doing so. Joab had killed Abner (<a href='/NABRE/10/3/22'>2SM 3:22-30</a>) and Amasa (<a href='/NABRE/10/20/4'>2SM 20:4-12</a>), thereby bringing blood guilt upon himself and perhaps upon his master David. Shimei had cursed David (<a href='/NABRE/10/16/5'>2SM 16:5-8</a>), though David pledged that Shimei would not be killed for it (<a href='/NABRE/10/19/16'>2SM 19:16-24</a>). Davids motives, however, may have been more personal. Joab also killed Davids son Absalom and chided David for his untimely public display of grief (<a href='/NABRE/10/18/9'>2SM 18:9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/10/19/8'>19:8</a>), and David may have felt himself free of the promise he made to Shimei because that promise was coerced by the presence of Shimeis thousand partisans backing him at the time."
NABRE,11,2,11,"[2] 2:12-46 The second major unit of the Solomon story shows how Solomon eliminated people he considered threats to the security of his throne. It is marked by a device called ""inclusion,"" where the text repeats a word, phrase, or idea at the beginning and end of a literary unit (see vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/2/12'>12b</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/2/46'>46b</a>). Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/11/14'>11:14-25</a>, where Solomon is unable to eliminate other threats to his security."
NABRE,11,2,17,"[3] 2:17-25 Abishag had belonged to Davids harem (<a href='/NABRE/11/1/3'>1:3-4</a>), which Solomon inherited. Adonijahs request could imply a challenge to Solomons accession and so exposes Adonijah to the suspicion of insurrection that will cost him his life; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/3/6'>2SM 3:6-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/16/21'>16:21-22</a>."
NABRE,11,2,26,[4] The narrator indulges in a subtle wordplay: Abiathars exile to Anathoth (anatot) continues the series of hardships he has endured (hitannita).
NABRE,11,2,42,"[5] 2:42-44 In his charge against Shimei, Solomon misrepresents the truth in two ways. He did not make Shimei take an oath. And he imposed capital punishment only on crossing the Wadi Kidron, to the east of Jerusalem. This was presumably to prevent Shimei from returning to his home, Bahurim, which lay in that direction; Gath, however, is southwest of Jerusalem. Solomons next words to Shimei reveal that he is really being punished for cursing David, not for violating Solomons command."
NABRE,11,3,1,"[1] 3:1-15 The third major unit of the Solomon story depicts the bright beginning of his reign. It includes the narrators remarks about Solomons marriage and his building projects, and a divine appearance to Solomon. Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/11/1'>11:1-13</a>, where the same themes recur, but in negative fashion. The story of the divine appearance is told also in <a href='/NABRE/14/1/1'>2CH 1:1-13</a>."
NABRE,11,3,15,"[2] 3:16-5:14 The fourth major unit of the Solomon story shows how Solomon used the three gifts that the Lord gave him in <a href='/NABRE/11/3/12'>3:12-13</a>: a listening heart (<a href='/NABRE/11/3/16'>3:16-28</a>), riches (<a href='/NABRE/11/4/1'>4:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/5/8'>5:8</a>), universal renown (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/9'>5:9-14</a>). In each case his gifts benefited the populace, from the lowest classes (<a href='/NABRE/11/3/16'>3:16-28</a>) to his whole people (<a href='/NABRE/11/4/20'>4:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/5/5'>5:5</a>) to the whole world (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/9'>5:9-14</a>). Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/9/26'>9:26</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/10/29'>10:29</a>, where the same three gifts all redound to the benefit of Solomon himself."
NABRE,11,3,26,"[3] 3:26-27 The true mother reveals herself by an uncommon and tender word for the child, ""baby."" With this, and the womans willingness to give up her child, Solomon realizes that she is the true mother, and quotes her words exactly in rendering his judgment."
NABRE,11,4,1,"[1] 4:1-5:8 The sub-unit on Solomons riches is organized around domestic affairs (<a href='/NABRE/11/4/1'>4:1-20</a>) and international affairs (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/1'>5:1-5</a>), with a short appendix on Solomons horses and chariots (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/6'>5:6-8</a>). Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/9/26'>9:26</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/10/29'>10:29</a>, where comparable elements reappear."
NABRE,11,4,7,"[2] 4:7-19 The administration of the kingdom thus initiated by Solomon continued in its main features for the duration of the monarchy in Israel and Judah. Note the use of ""all Israel"" to mean only the northern tribes (see also <a href='/NABRE/11/5/27'>5:27</a>). Solomons exactions did not fall evenly on the whole people, but favored his own southern tribe of Judah. Eventually this inequity would lead to the dissolution of the union of Israel and Judah (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/1'>12:1-19</a>)."
NABRE,11,4,8,[3] 4:8-19 Several of the governors are identified only by their fathers names.
NABRE,11,4,19,"[4] One governor…land of Judah: the royal territory of Judah had its own peculiar administration different from that of the twelve northern districts, each of which had to supply the king and his household with a months provisions of food each year (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/4/7'>7</a>)."
NABRE,11,5,1,"[1] 5:1-32 This translation follows the numeration of the Hebrew Bible, rather than the Vulgate; in many English translations, 5:1-14 is <a href='/NABRE/11/4/21'>4:21-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/5/15'>5:15</a> is <a href='/NABRE/11/5/1'>5:1</a>."
NABRE,11,5,1,"[2] The River: that is, the Euphrates. This claim may be exaggerated, but ""from the Euphrates to the border of Egypt"" was the traditional description of the extent of the Davidic holdings."
NABRE,11,5,2,"[3] The list of Solomons supplies may have originally belonged with the list of governors in <a href='/NABRE/11/4/7'>4:7-19</a>, but the author has placed it here to imply that Solomons vassal kingdoms, not his own citizenry, supplied his vast daily needs. The daily provisions listed could have supported several thousand people. Kors: see note on <a href='/NABRE/26/45/14'>EZE 45:14</a>."
NABRE,11,5,7,[4] This verse suggests that the governors also saw to the provender for Solomons animals (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/5/8'>8</a>).
NABRE,11,5,14,"[5] 5:15-32 The fifth major unit of the Solomon story explains the preparations Solomon made for the construction of the Temple. He negotiates with Hiram of Tyre for materiel (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/15'>5:15-26</a>), and conscripts a labor force for personnel (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/27'>5:27-32</a>). Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/9/11'>9:11-23</a>, which returns to the same two themes after the Temple has been built and dedicated. <a href='/NABRE/14/2/1'>2CH 2:1-17</a> presents another version of the same material."
NABRE,11,5,15,"[6] Davids friend: the term ""to be a friend,"" lit., ""to love,"" is political, and means that David and Hiram had been allies. The purpose of Hirams embassy is to determine whether Solomon is willing to continue the alliance. This unspoken agenda lies behind the negotiations about materials for the Temple, as the concluding v. <a href='/NABRE/11/5/26'>26</a> makes clear."
NABRE,11,5,22,"[7] 5:22-23 Although his reply is couched in polite, diplomatic language, Hiram renegotiates Solomons terms in his own favor. No Israelites are to enter Tyrian territory, and Solomon is not to pay the salary of Hirams laborers but rather to furnish ""provisions"" for his household—the same language used of the tribute Solomon received from his own vassals in v. <a href='/NABRE/11/5/2'>2</a>."
NABRE,11,5,25,"[8] Twenty kors: this means about two thousand gallons of the finest olive oil available, hand-pressed rather than produced in large olive presses, so that no debris (such as crushed olive pits, powder from the grinding stones) would contaminate the oil. Also see note on <a href='/NABRE/14/2/9'>2CH 2:9</a>."
NABRE,11,5,26,"[9] Made: lit., ""cut."" The story of Solomons arrangements with Hiram is framed by references to political alliance between Israel and Tyre (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/5/15'>15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/5/26'>26</a>). Since, in Hebrew idiom, Hiram and Solomon ""cut"" a covenant, this suggests that the agreement they reach for ""cutting"" wood (which clearly favors Hiram) reflects the terms of the larger treaty."

NABRE,11,6,1,"[1] 6:1-7:51 The central units of the Solomon story describe the building of the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/1'>6:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/7/51'>7:51</a>) and its dedication ceremony (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/1'>8:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/9/10'>9:10</a>). The account of the construction of the Temple (""the house"") is organized to give the reader a guided tour. Approaching from a distance, we see ground plans (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/2'>6:2-3</a>) and structural work in stone (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/4'>6:4-8</a>) and wood (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/9'>6:9-10</a>). After a brief interruption that recounts a divine word to Solomon (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/11'>6:11-13</a>), we enter the Temple to view the paneling and ornamentation of the nave (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/14'>6:14-18</a>), the gilded walls and golden entrance of the inner sanctuary or holy of holies (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/19'>6:19-22</a>), with its priceless interior decoration and furnishings (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/23'>6:23-28</a>). As we leave, we admire the interior carvings and gilded floor of the inner sanctuary (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/29'>6:29-30</a>), return to the nave through carved and gilded doors (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/31'>6:31-32</a>), and exit from the nave through another set of carved and gilded doors (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/33'>6:33-35</a>) to the courtyard (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/36'>6:36</a>). Our guide briefly points out the nearby palace complex (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/1'>7:1-12</a>); then we walk around the courtyard to marvel at Hirams heroic works in bronze: the two columns (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/15'>7:15-22</a>), the ""sea"" (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/23'>7:23-26</a>), and the ten stands and basins set along either side of the Temple buildings (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/27'>7:27-39</a>). The account ends with the smaller bronze vessels Hiram made for the Temple services (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/40'>7:40-47</a>) and the gold vessels that Solomon made (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/48'>7:48-50</a>). Unfortunately, several factors make it impossible to use the account to produce a satisfactory model of Solomons Temple. Throughout the account there are numerous technical architectural terms whose meaning is lost to us; and it is moreover likely that the author is describing the Temple as it stood in his own time, centuries after Solomons day. The Chronicler also describes the construction of the Temple in <a href='/NABRE/14/3/1'>2CH 3:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/14/4/22'>4:22</a> and its dedication in <a href='/NABRE/14/5/1'>2CH 5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/14/7/22'>7:22</a>."
NABRE,11,6,1,"[2] Construction of the Temple is here dated in relation to the traditional date of the exodus from Egypt, rounded off to a conventional twelve generations of forty years each. This chronology means that the Temple was built approximately midway between Israels two foundational deliverances, the exodus and the return from the Babylonian exile. The schematization of history implied in these figures recommends caution in using them for historical reconstruction."
NABRE,11,6,19,"[3] The innermost part of the house: the inner sanctuary or holy of holies reserved exclusively for the Lord, enthroned upon the cherubim over the ark of the covenant (<a href='/NABRE/14/3/10'>2CH 3:10-13</a>). See note on <a href='/NABRE/2/25/18'>EXO 25:18-20</a>."
NABRE,11,7,1,"[1] 7:1-12 The account of Solomons building of the Temple (the Lords ""house"") is interrupted by an account of his building of the palace (Solomons ""house""), which contained also the main buildings of public administration. The passage is anachronistic, since <a href='/NABRE/11/6/38'>6:38</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/7/1'>7:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/11/9/10'>9:10</a> imply that the palace was not begun until the Temple was completed. By placing the account here, the narrator highlights the fact that Solomon spent almost twice as long on his own ""house"" as on the Lords."
NABRE,11,7,8,"[2] Solomon did not build the house for Pharaohs daughter until Temple and palace were finished (<a href='/NABRE/11/3/1'>3:1</a>). By mentioning this marriage, the narrator keeps before the reader a developing theme in the Solomon story: the kings building activities for his foreign wives, which eventually implicate him in idolatry (<a href='/NABRE/11/3/1'>3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/7/8'>7:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/9/24'>9:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/11/1'>11:1-8</a>)."

NABRE,11,7,15,"[4] The two bronze columns were called Jachin and Boaz (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/7/21'>21</a>; also <a href='/NABRE/14/3/17'>2CH 3:17</a>); the significance of the names is unclear. The columns stood to the right and left of the Temple porch, and may have been intended to mark the entrance to the building as the entrance to Gods private dwelling. Their extraordinary size and elaborate decoration would have made them the most impressive parts of the Temple visible to the ordinary viewer, who was not permitted into the nave, let alone into the innermost sanctuary. According to <a href='/NABRE/24/52/21'>JER 52:21</a>, the columns were hollow, the bronze exterior being ""four fingers thick."""
NABRE,11,7,18,"[5] 7:18-20 The Hebrew text is corrupt in many places here, and alternative readings attested in the ancient versions are secondary attempts to make sense of the text. A clearer description of the columns and their decoration is found in vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/7/41'>41-42</a>."

NABRE,11,7,51,"[9] The account of the Temples construction has been punctuated by references to ""building"" (banah) or ""finishing"" (killah) it (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/1'>6:1b</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/6/9'>9a</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/6/14'>14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/6/38'>38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/7/40'>7:40</a>). Here, at the end of the account, the narrator uses a different verb for its ""completion,"" shillem, which allows him to play on the name of Solomon (shelomo)."
NABRE,11,8,1,"[1] 8:1-66 The account of the Temples dedication ceremony is organized concentrically: Solomon gathers the assembly (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/8/1'>1-13</a>), blesses it (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/8/14'>14-21</a>), utters a long dedicatory prayer (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/8/22'>22-53</a>), blesses the assembly again (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/8/54'>54-61</a>), and dismisses it (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/8/62'>62-66</a>). To this account is appended an appearance of the Lord to Solomon (<a href='/NABRE/11/9/2'>9:2-9</a>) that balances the divine word to Solomon in the account of the Temples construction (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/11'>6:11-13</a>)."
NABRE,11,8,2,"[2] ""The seventh month"" (""Ethanim"" in the Canaanite calendar) corresponded to late September/early October. The great festival at that time of year is the feast of Booths, or Succoth/Sukkoth (see <a href='/NABRE/3/23/33'>LEV 23:33-43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/16/13'>DEU 16:13-15</a>). The feast was important enough to warrant holding the dedication ceremony either a month before or eleven months after the Temple was completed in the eighth month (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/38'>6:38</a>)."
NABRE,11,8,6,"[3] 8:6-9 The transfer of the ark of the covenant into the newly constructed Temple building, Gods act of possession (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/10'>8:10-13</a>), and Solomons dedicatory prayer and sacrifices constituted the Temples solemn dedication and made of it the place of Gods presence in the midst of Israel for which David had hoped (<a href='/NABRE/10/6/12'>2SM 6:12-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/7/1'>7:1-3</a>). Later God expresses approval of the Temple with an oracle (<a href='/NABRE/11/9/3'>1KG 9:3-9</a>)."
NABRE,11,8,12,"[4] 8:12-13 This brief poem is rich in layered meanings. The ""dark cloud"" in which the Lord intends to dwell refers not only to the cloud that filled the Temple (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/8/10'>10</a>) but to the darkness of the windowless holy of holies and to the mystery of the God enthroned invisibly upon the cherubim as well. Solomon calls the Temple he offers God a firm base, using terminology similar to that used for Gods firm establishment of Solomons own kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/11/2/12'>2:12, 46</a>). Finally, Solomon intends this as a place for God to yashab, but the Hebrew word yashabcan mean ""to dwell"" or ""to sit."" In other words, the Temple can be understood both as a place where God resides and as the earthly foundation of Gods heavenly throne. The double meaning allows an understanding of the divine presence as both transcendent and graciously immanent. See Solomons sentiments in <a href='/NABRE/11/8/27'>8:27</a>, and the frequent reference in <a href='/NABRE/11/8/30'>8:30-52</a> to Gods hearing in heaven prayers that were offered in or toward the Temple."
NABRE,11,8,61,"[5] In urging the people to be ""wholly devoted"" (shalem), Solomon plays on his own name (shelomo), as if to imply that he himself exemplifies perfect fidelity to God."
NABRE,11,8,63,"[6] ""Communion offerings"" (shelamim) is another wordplay on the name of Solomon."
NABRE,11,9,9,"[1] 9:10-25 This unit of the Solomon story corresponds to <a href='/NABRE/11/5/15'>5:15-32</a>. It comprises the same two themes, negotiations with Hiram of Tyre (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/9/10'>10-14</a>) and use of conscripted labor (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/9/15'>15-23</a>); the last two verses mark the end of the account of Solomons building projects (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/9/24'>24-25</a>).

NABRE,11,9,14,"[3] The talent was a measure of weight that varied in the course of ancient Israels history from forty-five to one hundred thirty pounds. This would mean that, at the least, Hiram sent five thousand pounds of gold to Solomon, and the figure may be as much as three times that amount."
NABRE,11,9,15,"[4] Millo: probably means ground fill, and may refer to an artificial earthwork or platform of stamped ground south of the Temple area. It was begun by David (<a href='/NABRE/10/5/9'>2SM 5:9</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/9/24'>1KG 9:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/11/27'>11:27</a>."
NABRE,11,9,25,"[5] With these words the account of the construction and dedication of the Temple, which began in <a href='/NABRE/11/6/1'>6:1</a>, comes to a close. The verb ""complete"" (shillem) is a play on Solomons name (shelomo); see also the note on <a href='/NABRE/11/7/51'>7:51</a>."
NABRE,11,9,25,"[6] 9:26-10:29 The next major unit of the Solomon story returns to the theme of the three gifts the Lord gave Solomon in <a href='/NABRE/11/3/12'>3:12-13</a>: a listening heart (<a href='/NABRE/11/10/1'>10:1-13</a>), riches (<a href='/NABRE/11/9/26'>9:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/10/14'>10:14-22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/10/26'>26-29</a>), universal renown (<a href='/NABRE/11/10/23'>10:23-25</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/11/3/16'>3:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/5/14'>5:14</a>, where the same three themes structure the passage, the emphasis was on the benefits these gifts brought to the whole nation; here it is on the luxury they afford to Solomons own court. The material in <a href='/NABRE/11/9/26'>9:26-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/10/11'>10:11-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/10/22'>22</a> dealing with Solomons commercial fleet corresponds to the material on Solomons international affairs in <a href='/NABRE/11/5/1'>5:1-5</a>. Chronicles has a partial parallel to this material in <a href='/NABRE/14/9/17'>2CH 9:17-28</a>; see also <a href='/NABRE/14/1/14'>2CH 1:14-17</a>."

NABRE,11,10,1,"[1] 10:1-13 The sub-unit on Solomons wisdom contrasts with <a href='/NABRE/11/3/16'>3:16-28</a>. There Solomons gifts led him to listen to the humblest of his subjects; he accomplished justice and was revered by all his people. Here the emphasis is on his clever speech to a foreign monarch. She is duly impressed by the glory of his court, but it is she, not Solomon, who recalls the monarchs duty of establishing justice (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/10/9'>9</a>). The unit is interrupted briefly by a remark about Solomons maritime commerce (<a href='/NABRE/11/10/11'>10:11-12</a>)."

NABRE,11,10,13,"[4] 10:14-29 The material on Solomons riches, like that in <a href='/NABRE/11/4/1'>4:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/5/8'>5:8</a>, is organized around domestic affairs, international affairs, and chariots and horses (see note on <a href='/NABRE/11/4/1'>4:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/5/8'>5:8</a>), but contrasts with that earlier passage. There, Solomons domestic administration produced prosperity for all Judah and Israel (<a href='/NABRE/11/4/20'>4:20</a>); here the focus is on the wealth and luxury of Solomons own palace (<a href='/NABRE/11/10/14'>10:14-21</a>). There his international hegemony assured peace for all Judah and Israel (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/5'>5:5</a>); here his maritime ventures simply bring him more and more wealth (<a href='/NABRE/11/9/26'>9:26-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/10/11'>10:11-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/10/22'>22</a>). There even his livestock benefited from his prudent administration; here chariotry and horses are just another commodity to be traded (<a href='/NABRE/11/10/26'>10:26-29</a>)."
NABRE,11,10,22,"[5] Tarshish ships: large, strong vessels for long voyages. Tarshish was probably the ancient Tartessus, a Phoenician colony in southern Spain. Ivory, apes, and peacocks: the Hebrew words are obscure and the translations conjectural; however, the reference is certainly to exotic luxury items."
NABRE,11,11,1,"[1] 11:1-13 The next major unit of the Solomon story corresponds to <a href='/NABRE/11/3/1'>3:1-15</a>. Like the earlier passage it includes the narrators remarks about Solomons foreign wives and his building projects, and a divine word commenting on Solomons conduct. However, where <a href='/NABRE/11/3/1'>3:1-15</a> is generally positive toward Solomon, the present passage is unrelievedly negative. Chronicles has no parallel to this material."
NABRE,11,11,2,[2] Them: both the nations and their gods.
NABRE,11,11,13,"[3] 11:14-25 This unit of the Solomon story corresponds to <a href='/NABRE/11/2/12'>2:12</a>b-46, where Solomon secured his kingdom by eliminating three men he perceived as threats. In this passage, we learn of two foreigners the Lord raised up as ""adversaries"" to Solomon as early as the beginning of his reign (despite Solomons complacent claim to Hiram in <a href='/NABRE/11/5/18'>5:18</a> that he had no adversary). In the next section we will learn of a third opponent, Israelite rather than foreign, who turns out to be the ""servant of Solomon"" announced by the Lord in <a href='/NABRE/11/11/11'>11:11</a>. Chronicles has no parallel to this material."
NABRE,11,11,14,"[4] Adversary: Hebrew śatan, one who stands in opposition; in this context a political opponent."
NABRE,11,11,25,"[5] 11:26-43 The last major unit of the Solomon story tells how the prophet Ahijah announces the divine intention to take the larger part of Solomons kingdom from his control and give it to Jeroboam, Solomons servant. This counterbalances the first unit of the story, 1:1-2:12a, where another prophet, Nathan, managed to influence the royal succession and obtain the throne for Solomon. The unit is also the first part of the story of Jeroboam (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/26'>11:26</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/14/20'>14:20</a>). It thus acts as a literary hinge connecting the two stories. Chronicles contains a death notice for Solomon in <a href='/NABRE/14/9/29'>2CH 9:29-31</a>."
NABRE,11,11,29,"[6] The narrator uses a powerful wordplay here. In the Hebrew consonantal text, Ahijahs cloak (slmh) is indistinguishable from Solomons name (slmh). Since a prophetic gesture such as Ahijahs was understood as effecting the event it announced, Ahijahs tearing of his cloak embodies the divine action that will tear Solomons kingdom apart (cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/11/11'>11-13</a>)."
NABRE,11,12,1,"[1] 12:1-14:20 Like the story of the reign of Solomon, the story of the reign of Jeroboam is concentrically organized. Ahijahs oracle of promise to Jeroboam (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/26'>11:26-43</a>) belongs to both stories, ending that of Solomon (see note on <a href='/NABRE/11/1/1'>1:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/11/43'>11:43</a>) and beginning that of Jeroboam; it corresponds to Ahijahs oracle of condemnation in <a href='/NABRE/11/14/1'>14:1-20</a>. Within those literary boundaries are accounts of political (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/1'>12:1-20</a>) and religious (<a href='/NABRE/11/13/11'>13:11-34</a>) disunity between Israel and Judah. The center of the story is the account of Jeroboams heterodox cultic innovations (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/26'>12:26-31</a>)."
NABRE,11,12,1,"[2] 12:1-20 The first major unit of the Jeroboam story was Ahijahs oracle (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/26'>11:26-40</a>), followed by the notice of Solomons death (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/41'>11:41-43</a>). This is the second major unit. It tells how Jeroboam came to the throne of Israel after the intransigence of Solomons son Rehoboam provoked the northern tribes to secede from Jerusalem. The political disunity of the two kingdoms fulfills the word spoken by Ahijah. Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/13/11'>13:11-32</a>, where Jeroboams improper cultic innovations produce religious disunity as well. The scene is concentrically arranged: narrative introduction, first interview, first consultation, second consultation, second interview, narrative conclusion. Chronicles has a parallel version of this story in <a href='/NABRE/14/10/1'>2CH 10:1-19</a>."
NABRE,11,12,1,"[3] Shechem: chief city of the northern tribes, where a covenant had previously been made between the Lord and his people and a stone of witness had been erected in memory of the event (<a href='/NABRE/6/24/25'>JOS 24:25-27</a>). All Israel: see note on <a href='/NABRE/11/4/7'>4:7-19</a>."
NABRE,11,12,16,"[4] What share have we in David?: even in Davids time the northern tribes seemed ready to withdraw from the union with Judah (<a href='/NABRE/10/20/1'>2SM 20:1</a>). The unreasonable attitude of Rehoboam toward them intensified the discontent caused by the oppression of Solomon (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/12/4'>4</a>) and thus precipitated the political separation of the two kingdoms. In the view of the Deuteronomistic historian (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/35'>1KG 11:35-36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/12/24'>12:24</a>), this was by the Lords decree."
NABRE,11,12,18,"[5] Adoram: the name is a shortened form of ""Adoniram"" (see <a href='/NABRE/11/4/6'>4:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/5/28'>5:28</a>). If this is the same Adoram who held the position in Davids day (<a href='/NABRE/10/20/24'>2SM 20:24</a>), he would have been a very old man."
NABRE,11,12,20,"[6] 12:21-25 The center of this unit is a divine oracle delivered by a man of God of the Southern Kingdom in which the Lord affirms his approval of the secession of the northern tribes. Compare <a href='/NABRE/11/13/1'>13:1-10</a>, where another man of God from Judah proclaims the Lords condemnation of Jeroboams religious separatism. Chronicles has a very similar version of Shemaiahs oracle in <a href='/NABRE/14/11/1'>2CH 11:1-4</a>."
NABRE,11,12,25,"[7] 12:26-31 At the center of the story of Jeroboam the narrator describes how the king went beyond the political separation of Israel from Judah to create a separatist religious system as well. Jeroboam feared that continued worship in the single Temple in Jerusalem would threaten the political independence of his kingdom. To prevent this he established sanctuaries with non-levitical clergy in his own territory. At two of the sanctuaries he set up golden calves, which the narrator depicts as idols. Thus begins what will later be called ""the sin of Jeroboam"" (<a href='/NABRE/11/13/34'>13:34</a>), a theme that will be echoed throughout 1-2 Kings in the condemnations of almost every king of the Northern Kingdom. Historically, Jeroboams innovations were not as heterodox as our narrative portrays them. Bethel was an ancient and traditional site for worship of the Lord; and the calves were probably intended to be a dais for the deity invisibly enthroned upon them, rather like the cherubim atop the ark of the covenant."
NABRE,11,12,29,"[8] Bethel…Dan: at the southern and northern boundaries of the separate kingdom of Israel, where sanctuaries had existed in the past (<a href='/NABRE/1/12/8'>GEN 12:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/13/3'>13:3-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/28/10'>28:10-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/35/1'>35:1-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/18/1'>JUG 18:1-31</a>)."
NABRE,11,12,31,"[9] 12:32-13:10 This unit of the Jeroboam story corresponds to <a href='/NABRE/11/12/21'>12:21-25</a>. Before Jeroboams cultic innovations, a man of God from Judah proclaimed the Lords approval of the political separation of the kingdoms. After Jeroboams cultic innovations, a man of God from Judah proclaims the Lords disapproval of Israels religious separatism. The unit begins with a long, detailed introduction about the dedication festival Jeroboam holds at Bethel (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/32'>12:32-33</a>); then follows the scene of the ceremony disrupted by the oracle of the man of God (<a href='/NABRE/11/13/1'>13:1-10</a>)."
NABRE,11,13,10,"[1] 13:11-34 The next major unit illustrates how Jeroboams cultic innovations begin to alienate prophetic figures of the two kingdoms. Nevertheless, the Lords word is stronger than any human attempt to thwart it. The two prophets also foreshadow the destinies of their respective kingdoms. Israels experiment with idolatry can tempt Judah to abandon its faithfulness to the Lord. If Judah succumbs, and no longer speaks the word that can call Israel back to the true God, then the only hope for reuniting the two kingdoms will be when they have both died the death of exile."
NABRE,11,14,1,"[1] 14:1-20 The last major unit of the Jeroboam story recounts the story of Ahijah of Shilohs oracle condemning the entire house of Jeroboam; this is followed by a formulaic notice of Jeroboams death and the succession of his son. Compare the first unit of the Jeroboam story, 11:26-43, which recounted Ahijahs oracle proclaiming Jeroboams kingship, followed by the formulaic notice of the death of Solomon."
NABRE,11,14,15,[2] The River: the Euphrates; see note on <a href='/NABRE/11/5/1'>5:1</a>.
NABRE,11,14,21,"[3] 14:21-16:34 The treatment of the events of Jeroboams reign shows that the author believes that the political division of the kingdoms embodies the Lords will, but that their religious separation is undesirable. The Israelites are, in effect, one people of God under two royal administrations. This complex arrangement is reflected in the way 1-2 Kings organizes the history of the divided kingdoms. Each reign is treated as a unity: the kings, whether of Israel or Judah, are legitimate rulers. But the accounts of northern and southern kings are interwoven in the order in which each came to the throne, without regard to which kingdom they ruled: the people of God is one."
NABRE,11,14,21,"[4] The account of each kings reign follows the same basic pattern: a formulaic introduction, a theological evaluation based on religious fidelity, a brief account of an event from the kings reign, and a formulaic conclusion."
NABRE,11,14,23,[5] Asherahs: see note on <a href='/NABRE/2/34/13'>EXO 34:13</a>.
NABRE,11,14,25,"[6] 14:25-28, 30 The narrator recounts Shishaks campaign here to imply that it was punishment for Judahs evil, and perhaps to cast him as supporting Jeroboam in his constant warfare with Rehoboam. (Shishak was named as Jeroboams protector and patron in <a href='/NABRE/11/11/40'>11:40</a>.) Egyptian records of the campaign list one hundred fifty cities conquered in Israel as well as Judah, but Jerusalem is not one of them. Chronicles has a parallel version of this account in <a href='/NABRE/14/12/9'>2CH 12:9-11</a>."
NABRE,11,15,10,"[1] Maacah was in fact Asas grandmother (see v. <a href='/NABRE/11/15/2'>2</a>), but ""kings mother"" was perhaps a title for the gebira, the ""Great Lady"" or ""queen mother"" (see, for instance, 2:19). This influential position was usually held by the kings biological mother, but Maacah may have retained it after the early death of her son Abijam."
NABRE,11,15,18,"[2] Ben-hadad…king of Aram: Ben-hadad I, third successor of Rezon, who had thrown off the yoke of the Israelites during the reign of Solomon and become king of Aram (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/23'>11:23-24</a>). Chronicles has a parallel version of this account in <a href='/NABRE/14/16/1'>2CH 16:1-6</a>. Who ruled: lit., ""sitting,"" i.e., enthroned, possibly also meaning ""resident"" or ""residing."""
NABRE,11,16,34,[1] See note on <a href='/NABRE/6/6/26'>JOS 6:26</a>.
NABRE,11,17,1,"[1] 17:1-19:21 The central section of 1-2 Kings tells the story of the dynasty of Omri. That dynasty begins and ends in civil war (<a href='/NABRE/11/16/21'>1KG 16:21-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/9/1'>2KG 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/11/1'>11</a>). Most of the story is set during the reigns of Ahab of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/11/16/29'>1KG 16:29</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/22/40'>22:40</a>) and his son Joram (<a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>2KG 3:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/9/26'>9:26</a>) and focuses particularly on the interaction of the king with various prophets, especially Ahab with Elijah and Joram with Elisha. The story of Ahab itself contains two large complexes, a series of narratives about Elijah (<a href='/NABRE/11/17/1'>1KG 17:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/19/21'>19:21</a>) and a series about hostility between Ahab and the prophets (<a href='/NABRE/11/20/1'>1KG 20:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/22/38'>22:38</a>)."
NABRE,11,17,1,[2] 17:1-24 The story of Elijah is in three parts. The first (chap. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/1'>17</a>) describes how Elijah proclaimed a drought on Gods authority and how he survived during the drought. The second (chap. <a href='/NABRE/11/18/1'>18</a>) describes how he ends the drought by bringing the populace back to exclusive worship of the Lord. The third (chap. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/1'>19</a>) describes Elijahs despair at the failure of his prophetic mission and his consequent attempt to resign from the prophetic office.
NABRE,11,17,1,"[3] This verse introduces the enigmatic figure of Elijah the Tishbite. (The name ""Elijah"" means ""the Lord is my God."" The meaning of ""Tishbite"" is unknown; it may refer to a place or to a social class.) His appearance before Ahab is abrupt and involves several matters that will unify the whole Elijah story. His claim to ""serve the Lord"" (lit., to ""stand before the Lord"") points forward to <a href='/NABRE/11/19/13'>19:13</a>, where he refuses to do so; the center of narrative tension on this level is the question of the prophets autonomy in Gods service. His proclamation of a drought points forward to <a href='/NABRE/11/18/41'>18:41-45</a> where he announces the droughts end; the center of narrative tension on this level is the struggle between the Lord and the Canaanite fertility god Baal for the loyalties of Israel. His claim that the drought is due to his own word of power (""except at my word"") points forward to <a href='/NABRE/11/17/24'>17:24</a> where the widow acknowledges the divine source of the word Elijah speaks; the center of narrative tension on this level is the gradual characterization of the prophet as one who receives a divine word (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/17/8'>8</a>), obeys it (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/5'>5</a>), conveys an effective divine word of threat (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/1'>1</a>) or promise (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/14'>14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/17/16'>16</a>), and even speaks an effective human word of entreaty to God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/17/22'>22</a>)."
NABRE,11,18,1,"[1] 18:1-45 The story of the conflict with the prophets of Baal (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/18/21'>21-40</a>) is embedded in the story of the drought and its ending (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/18/1'>1-20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/18/41'>41-45</a>). The connection between the two stories is found in Canaanite theology, in whose pantheon Baal, ""the Cloud Rider,"" the god of rain and storm, was recognized as the one who brings fertility. Worship of many gods was virtually universal in the ancient world; the Israelite requirement of exclusive worship of the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/2/20/3'>EXO 20:3</a>) was unique. The people of Israel had apparently become comfortable worshiping both Baal and the Lord, perhaps assigning mutually exclusive spheres of influence to each. By claiming authority over the rain (<a href='/NABRE/11/17/1'>17:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/18/1'>18:1</a>), the Lord was challenging Baals power in Baals own domain. The entire drought story in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/1'>17</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/18/1'>18</a> implies what becomes explicit in <a href='/NABRE/11/18/21'>18:21-40</a>: this is a struggle between the Lord and Baal for the loyalties of the people of Israel."
NABRE,11,18,8,"[2] Elijah is here: the Hebrew hinneh eliyahuinvolves a pun. The sentence means both ""Elijah is here,"" informing Ahab that the prophet has been found, and ""Behold, Yhwh is my God"" (the meaning of the name ""Elijah"")."
NABRE,11,19,1,"[1] 19:1-21 The story of Elijahs journey to Mount Horeb begins as a flight from danger, but takes a surprising turn. The prophet makes his solitary way to the mountain where the Lord had appeared to Moses and the Israelites (""Horeb"" is an alternate name for ""Sinai""). Like Moses on the holy mountain, Elijah experiences a theophany and receives a commission."
NABRE,11,19,5,"[2] 19:5-7 Sound asleep, Elijah is startled awake by an unspecified ""messenger."" Only in v. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/7'>7</a> is the figure identified as a messenger (or ""angel"") of the Lord."
NABRE,11,19,11,"[3] 19:11-13 To ""stand before the Lord"" is a literal translation of a Hebrew idiom meaning ""to serve the Lord""; Elijah has used this idiom twice before to describe himself as the Lords servant (<a href='/NABRE/11/17/1'>17:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/18/15'>18:15</a>). The Lords command, then, means that Elijah is to take up once again the prophetic service to which he has been appointed. The Lords question, ""Why are you here?"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/9'>9</a>, repeated in v. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/13'>13</a>), could imply an accusation that he is abandoning his prophetic office. In v. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/15'>15</a>, the Lord tells him to go back."
NABRE,11,19,12,"[4] Compare these divine manifestations to Elijah with those to Moses on the same mountain (<a href='/NABRE/2/19/16'>EXO 19:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/33/18'>33:18-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/5'>34:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/10'>DEU 4:10-15</a>). Though various phenomena, such as wind, storms, earthquakes, fire, accompany the divine presence, they do not constitute the presence itself which, like the ""silent sound,"" is mysterious and ultimately ungraspable. Moses and Elijah, the two figures who experienced Gods theophany on this mountain, reappear with Jesus on another mountain at his transfiguration (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/1'>MAT 17:1-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/9/2'>MAK 9:2-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/9/28'>LUK 9:28-36</a>)."
NABRE,11,19,15,"[5] 19:15-17 Elijah himself carried out only the last of the three commissions entrusted to him (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/19'>19-21</a>); Elisha performed the first himself (<a href='/NABRE/12/8/7'>2KG 8:7-19</a>), and the second, the anointing of Jehu, through one of his followers (<a href='/NABRE/12/9/1'>2KG 9:1-10</a>)."
NABRE,11,19,19,"[6] 19:19-21 Elijahs act of throwing his mantle over the shoulders of Elisha associates him with Elijah as a servant (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/19/21'>21</a>). Elisha will later succeed to Elijahs position and prophetic power (<a href='/NABRE/12/2/1'>2KG 2:1-15</a>). Elishas prompt response, destroying his plow and oxen, signifies a radical change from his former manner of living."
NABRE,11,20,1,"[1] 20:1-22:54 Although coverage of Ahabs reign began in <a href='/NABRE/11/16/29'>16:29</a>, he was only a secondary character in the chapters about Elijah. Now attention focuses on Ahab. Each of these chapters tells a story of the king (<a href='/NABRE/11/20/1'>20:1-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/21/1'>21:1-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/1'>22:1-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/22/29'>29-38</a>), to which is attached a scene of prophetic condemnation (<a href='/NABRE/11/20/30'>20:30-42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/21/17'>21:17-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/5'>22:5-28</a>). As relations between Ahab and the prophets of the Lord deteriorate, the scenes of prophetic condemnation get longer and the condemnations themselves become more pointed. Some historians doubt that the stories of hostility between Israel and Aram (chaps. 20 and 22) originally pertained to the reign of Ahab. If this is correct, their original setting may have been several decades later."
NABRE,11,20,1,"[2] 20:1-34 This story recounts two battles through which Ahab won freedom for Israel from vassalage to Ben-hadad of Syria. The story is chiastically arranged: negotiations (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/1'>1-12</a>), battle (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/13'>13-21</a>), battle (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/22'>22-30</a>), negotiations (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/31'>31-34</a>). The ensuing prophetic condemnation is surprising, since the portrait of Ahab in vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/1'>1-34</a> is apparently quite positive."
NABRE,11,20,16,"[3] 20:16-19 The narrator uses a sort of verbal split-screen technique to show us two separate and simultaneous scenes. At the gates of Samaria, the Israelite forces are coming out to battle (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/16'>16a</a>): first the aides (lit., ""young men""; v. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/17'>17a</a>), then the whole army (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/19'>19</a>). Meanwhile in the Aramean camp Ben-hadad is getting drunk (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/16'>16</a>b), receiving reports (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/17'>17</a>b) and issuing commands (v. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/18'>18</a>)."
NABRE,11,20,22,"[4] At the turning of the year: the idiom may mean ""next year about this time"" or ""at the beginning of the year,"" i.e., the spring (cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/11/1'>2SM 11:1</a>)."
NABRE,11,20,32,[5] He is my brother: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/11/9/13'>9:13</a>.
NABRE,11,20,39,"[6] The ""man"" is ostensibly a prisoner of war, to be kept or sold as a slave. In the event he escapes, the one charged with guarding him would be obliged either to pay a fine or to take his place as a slave. The fine, however, is exorbitant: a talent of silver is roughly one hundred times the price of an ordinary slave (see <a href='/NABRE/2/21/32'>EXO 21:32</a>). This is the only clue Ahab will get that he is being set up and that the story is really about himself in his dealings with Ben-hadad. In <a href='/NABRE/10/14/1'>2SM 14:1-20</a>, the wise woman of Tekoa uses the same technique with King David: she tells a story that elicits a reaction from the king; David is tricked into pronouncing judgment on himself, as the story parallels his own situation. The prophet Nathan (<a href='/NABRE/10/12/1'>2SM 12:1-7</a>) likewise uses a story that leads David to see his sin for what it is."
NABRE,11,20,42,[7] Under the ban: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/5/2/34'>DEU 2:34</a>.
NABRE,11,21,1,"[1] 21:1-16 The story tells how Jezebel manipulates important structures of Israelite social order, law, and religious observance to eliminate a faithful Israelite landowner who frustrates Ahabs will."
NABRE,11,21,3,"[2] Heritage: Hebrew naḥalah. Naboth is unwilling to sell or exchange his vineyard. According to the Israelite system of land tenure and distribution, land was held in common within a social unit. The ancestral naḥalahwas not private property, to be alienated at will."
NABRE,11,21,20,"[3] 21:20-26 In these verses the narrator uses against the third Israelite dynasty the same condemnation formula that was uttered against the first two dynasties, those of Jeroboam (<a href='/NABRE/11/14/9'>14:9-11</a>) and Baasha (<a href='/NABRE/11/16/2'>16:2-4</a>). Part of the formula is put in Elijahs mouth, in an oracle against Ahab and his descendants (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/21/21'>21-22</a>), and part of it in an aside to the reader that extends the condemnation to Ahabs wife, Jezebel, and his whole household (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/21/23'>23-24</a>). The oracle against Jezebel will be fulfilled in <a href='/NABRE/12/9/36'>2KG 9:36</a>; the obliteration of the dynasty will be recounted in the bloody stories of <a href='/NABRE/12/9/1'>2KG 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/11/1'>11</a>."
NABRE,11,22,1,"[1] 22:1-40 This chapter presents a contrasting parallel to chap. <a href='/NABRE/11/20/1'>20</a>, where Ahab enjoyed victories over Arams aggression. Here Ahab is the aggressor, but falls in battle against Aram. Like the preceding chapters, it contains a story of Ahab plus an episode of prophetic condemnation. The story ends with the formulaic conclusion to Ahabs reign (vv. <a href='/NABRE/11/22/39'>39-40</a>). Chronicles has a parallel version of this account in <a href='/NABRE/14/18/1'>2CH 18:1-34</a>. After the story of Ahabs death come accounts of the reign of Jehoshaphat (paralleled in <a href='/NABRE/14/20/31'>2CH 20:31-37</a>) and of the beginning of the reign of Ahaziah."
NABRE,11,22,6,"[2] Though Ahab is clearly intended to understand the oracle as prophesying his success, the prophets words are ambiguous. ""The lord"" (not ""the Lord,"" i.e., the proper name of Israels God) who will give victory is unidentified, as is the king to whom it will be given."
NABRE,11,22,11,"[3] The ""two"" horns probably symbolize the coalition of two kings, Ahab and Jehoshaphat."
NABRE,11,22,17,"[4] Micaiahs oracle uses the common ancient metaphor of ""shepherd"" for the king. It means that the Israelite forces will be left leaderless because the king (or perhaps both kings: the word ""master"" could be singular or plural in Hebrew) will die in battle."
NABRE,11,22,19,"[5] 22:19-23 Since Ahabs intention to attack Ramoth-gilead is unshaken, Micaiah reveals Gods plan to trick Ahab to his death, and thus virtually dares Ahab to walk into the trap with his eyes open. The work of the ""lying spirit"" explains the ambiguities of the prophets original oracle in v. <a href='/NABRE/11/22/6'>6</a>. Prophets ""stand in the council of the Lord"" and are privy to its deliberations; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/22'>JER 23:22</a>."
NABRE,11,22,20,"[6] Fall on Ramoth-gilead: lit., ""heights of Gilead""; even the Lords words are double-meaning. God wants Ahab to ""fall on"" (that is, attack) Ramoth-gilead so that he will ""fall on"" (that is, die on) Ramoth-gilead."
NABRE,11,22,28,"[7] The last words of the verse are a scribal gloss attributing to Micaiah, son of Imlah, the opening words of the book of a different Micaiah (Micah), the prophet of Moresheth, the sixth of the twelve minor prophets of the Old Testament canon."
NABRE,11,22,51,[8] 22:52-54 The account of Ahaziahs reign continues in 2 Kings.
NABRE,11,22,52,"[9] Seventeenth year: so the present Hebrew text. This is consistent with the figures in <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>2KG 3:1</a>, but together those figures conflict with information in <a href='/NABRE/11/22/42'>1KG 22:42</a> and <a href='/NABRE/12/1/17'>2KG 1:17</a>. The problem of the chronology of the kings of Israel and Judah has never been convincingly resolved; it is complicated by the fact that the ancient Greek translation sometimes has different lengths of reign and different accession dates. See further note on <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>2KG 3:1</a>."
NABRE,12,1,2,"[1] Baalzebub: in this form, ""Baal of flies."" The name in the Hebrew text is a derisive alteration of Baalzebul, ""Prince Baal."" The best New Testament evidence supports the latter form in <a href='/NABRE/40/10/25'>MAT 10:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/11/15'>LUK 11:15</a>."
NABRE,12,1,8,[2] Hairy garment: a sign of prophetic calling; see <a href='/NABRE/38/13/4'>ZEC 13:4</a>. John the Baptizer wore a similarly distinctive mantle; see <a href='/NABRE/40/3/4'>MAT 3:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/1/6'>MAK 1:6</a>.
NABRE,12,1,12,"[3] Divine fire: lit., ""fire of God,"" which in Hebrew sounds quite like ""man of God."" The play on words is the basis for Elijahs retort. This story was told among the people to enhance the dignity of the prophet and to reflect the power of God whom he served. A similar phrase, ""the Lords fire,"" described the miraculous divine fire that fell from a cloudless sky to consume Elijahs offering in <a href='/NABRE/11/18/38'>1KG 18:38</a>."
NABRE,12,1,17,"[4] Joram: in 2 Kings the name ""Joram"" (yoram) and its variant ""Jehoram"" (yehoram) are used interchangeably. To avoid the impression that they are different names and designate different people, both forms are rendered ""Joram"" in this translation. Confusion arises, however, because the king of Israel whose reign is recounted beginning in <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>3:1</a> and the contemporary king of Judah whose reign is recounted beginning in <a href='/NABRE/12/8/16'>8:16</a> share this name. On the relationship of Joram of Israel to Joram of Judah, see note on <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>3:1</a>."
NABRE,12,2,1,"[1] 2:1-25 The story of Elishas succession to Elijahs prophetic office is oddly set between the death of Ahaziah (<a href='/NABRE/12/1/17'>1:17</a>) and the accession of his successor (<a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>3:1</a>). The effect is to place this scene, which is the central scene in the whole of 1-2 Kings, outside of time. It thereby becomes almost mythic in its import and reminds us that, behind the transitory flow of kings and kingdoms, stand the eternal word of God and the prophets who give it voice. Just as 1-2 Kings pivots on this chapter, so this scene too is concentrically constructed. Together Elijah and Elisha journey to Bethel, thence to Jericho, and thence across the Jordan. There Elijah is taken up in the whirlwind and Elijahs mantle of power comes to Elisha. Now alone, Elisha crosses the Jordan again, returns to Jericho and thence back to Bethel."
NABRE,12,2,1,"[2] Gilgal: there are several places in the Hebrew Bible named Gilgal; the word probably means ""circle,"" viz. of stones. Here the route of the prophets journey rules out the most famous Gilgal (<a href='/NABRE/6/4/1'>JOS 4</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/5/1'>5</a>), the one near Jericho. This Gilgal may have been located in the area of modern Jiljulieh, approximately seven miles north of Bethel, which seems to preserve the ancient name."
NABRE,12,2,9,"[3] Double portion of your spirit: as the firstborn son inherited a double portion of his fathers property (<a href='/NABRE/5/21/17'>DEU 21:17</a>), so Elisha asks to inherit from Elijah his spirit of prophecy in the degree befitting his principal disciple. In <a href='/NABRE/4/11/17'>NUM 11:17-25</a>, God bestows some of the spirit of Moses on others."
NABRE,12,2,12,"[4] My father: a religious title accorded prophetic leaders; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/6/21'>6:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/8/9'>8:9</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/12/13/14'>13:14</a>, where King Joash of Israel reacts to Elishas own impending death with the same words Elisha uses here."
NABRE,12,2,14,"[5] The Lord, the God of Elijah—where is he now?: the words in Hebrew have an incantatory quality, as if Elisha is invoking both the divine name and the name of his departed master in an attempt to duplicate Elijahs miracle."
NABRE,12,2,23,[6] 2:23-24 This story probably was told to warn children of the importance of respect for prophets.
NABRE,12,3,1,"[1] 3:1-9:13 After the formulaic introduction to the reign of Joram of Israel, this section falls into two parts. The first contains several stories about the prophet Elisha, both in private and in public life. There are four longer stories, arranged in an ABBA pattern: drought during war with Moab (vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/3/4'>4-27</a>), restoration of the Shunammites son (<a href='/NABRE/12/4/8'>4:8-37</a>), healing of Naaman (<a href='/NABRE/12/5/1'>5:1-27</a>), famine during war with Aram (<a href='/NABRE/12/6/24'>6:24</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/7/20'>7:20</a>). The last three of these stories are each preceded and followed by short anecdotal tales about Elisha. The second part of this section turns to the political realm. Elisha carries out the Lords commissions to Elijah (<a href='/NABRE/11/19/15'>1KG 19:15-17</a>) to anoint Hazael king of Aram (<a href='/NABRE/12/8/7'>2KG 8:7-15</a>) and Jehu king of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/12/9/1'>9:1-13</a>). To prepare for the story of Jehus insurrection (<a href='/NABRE/12/9/14'>9:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/11/20'>11:20</a>), the narrator places between those two narratives notices about the royal succession in Judah (<a href='/NABRE/12/8/16'>8:16-24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/8/25'>25-29</a>). The formulaic conclusions to the reigns of Joram of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah (<a href='/NABRE/12/8/25'>8:25-29</a>) are missing, since the deaths of both will be recounted in the story of Jehus insurrection."
NABRE,12,3,1,"[2] The contradiction between <a href='/NABRE/12/1/17'>1:17</a> and v. <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>1</a> regarding the year when Joram succeeded Ahaziah of Israel makes any reconstruction of the chronology of Israels and Judahs kings uncertain. Some scholars think that one or the other notice is simply incorrect. Others propose to explain the discrepancy by a co-regency: Jehoshaphat of Judah would have shared the throne with his son Joram from Jehoshaphats seventeenth year until he died in the twenty-fifth year of his reign (<a href='/NABRE/11/22/42'>1KG 22:42</a>; see also <a href='/NABRE/12/8/16'>2KG 8:16</a>). The issue is further complicated by the speculation of some historians that ""Joram of Israel"" (""son"" of Ahab of Israel: v. <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>1</a>) and ""Joram of Judah"" (""son-in-law"" of Ahab of Israel: 8:18) were in fact the same person, in whom the royal houses and separate realms of Israel and Judah were briefly reunited."
NABRE,12,3,4,"[3] In the period of oral tradition, it seems that stories of kings were often told without identifying the kings by name. (Vestiges of this anonymity are still visible in <a href='/NABRE/11/3/16'>1KG 3:16-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/20/4'>20:4-43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/1'>22:1-38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/6/8'>2KG 6:8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/7/20'>7:20</a>.) Names (such as ""Ahab"" in <a href='/NABRE/11/20/13'>1KG 20:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/20'>22:20</a>) were added later. As a consequence, the historical attachment of such stories to the kings about whom they are told is open to question. (See note on <a href='/NABRE/11/20/1'>1KG 20:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/22/54'>22:54</a>.) The present story about a campaign against Moab by Joram and Jehoshaphat has several striking similarities to the campaign against Ramoth-gilead by Ahab and Jehoshaphat in <a href='/NABRE/11/22/1'>1KG 22:1-38</a>. There exists a Moabite inscription that contains Meshas self-aggrandizing account of his successful rebellion against Israel, but the times and places it mentions are different from those implied in vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/3/4'>4-27</a>."
NABRE,12,3,11,"[4] Poured water on the hands of Elijah: possibly a metaphor for ""was Elijahs servant."" But the phrase occurs nowhere else in the Old Testament and its meaning is not certain."
NABRE,12,3,25,"[5] Kir-hareseth: a major city of Moab, identified with modern Kerak, east of the Dead Sea; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/16/7'>ISA 16:7, 11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/48/31'>JER 48:31, 36</a>."
NABRE,12,3,27,"[6] The wrath against Israel: probably the wrath of Chemosh, the Moabite god to whom the child was offered. The Israelites, intimidated by this wrath, retreat."
NABRE,12,4,1,[1] His creditor…into servitude: Israelite law permitted the selling of wife and children into slavery for debt; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/21/7'>EXO 21:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/2/6'>AMO 2:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/8/6'>8:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/50/1'>ISA 50:1</a>.
NABRE,12,4,13,"[2] I am living among my own people: the Shunammite woman declines Elishas offer. Surrounded by the support of her family and her clan, she is secure. Ironically, at some point in the future Elishas advice will send her to live among foreigners (see <a href='/NABRE/12/8/1'>8:1-2</a>)."
NABRE,12,4,29,"[3] Give no greeting: a profuse exchange of greetings and compliments would normally surround the chance encounter of acquaintances on the road. This would, however, take time, and Gehazis mission was urgent. Compare <a href='/NABRE/42/10/4'>LUK 10:4</a>."
NABRE,12,5,1,"[1] Leper: the terms traditionally translated ""leper"" and ""leprosy"" covered a wide variety of skin disorders like psoriasis, eczema, and seborrhea, but probably not Hansens disease (modern ""leprosy""); there is no clear evidence of its existence in biblical times."
NABRE,12,5,12,"[2] Wash in them and be cleansed: typical of the ambiguity in ritual healing or cleanliness. The muddy waters of the Jordan are no match hygienically for the mountain spring waters of Damascus; ritually, it is the other way around."
NABRE,12,5,17,"[3] Two mule-loads of earth: worship of the Lord is associated with the soil of the Holy Land, where he is present."
NABRE,12,5,19,"[4] Go in peace: Elisha understands and approves the situation of Naaman who, though now a worshiper of the God of Israel, is required by his courtly office to assist his master, the king (""leans upon my arm,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/12/5/18'>18</a>), worshiping in the temple of the Canaanite god Baal-Rimmon."
NABRE,12,5,27,"[5] With skin like snow: ""snow"" is often used to describe the skin conditions covered by the term ""leprosy"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/4/6'>EXO 4:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/12/10'>NUM 12:10</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/12/5/1'>5:1</a>). It is unclear whether the comparison is with the white color, dry flakes, or moist shine, any of which can occur in the relevant skin diseases."
NABRE,12,6,22,"[1] With your sword or bow: since the king would not slay prisoners who had surrendered to his power, much less should he slay prisoners captured by Gods power. This wartime practice stands in contrast to that of holy war, where prisoners were placed under the ban and so devoted to destruction (see <a href='/NABRE/11/20/35'>1KG 20:35-43</a>)."
NABRE,12,6,25,"[2] ""Dove droppings"": it is unclear whether this phrase is to be read literally (e.g., dung used as fuel) or as the nickname of a type of edible plant, as attested in Arabic. A kab was probably around a quart."
NABRE,12,6,33,"[3] The messenger speaks in the kings name. Similarly, Elishas response in the next verse can be spoken of as delivered to the king (<a href='/NABRE/12/7/18'>7:18</a>)."

Hazael focuses on the question of his power, making no comment on the atrocities Elisha predicts he will commit."
NABRE,12,8,16,"[4] On the apparent contradictions among <a href='/NABRE/12/1/17'>1:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>3:1</a>, and this verse, see note on <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>3:1</a>."
NABRE,12,8,24,"[5] 8:25-29 The narrative of Ahaziahs reign, like that of Joram of Israel, lacks the standard formulaic conclusion. The deaths of both kings, and indeed the obliteration of the whole house of Omri, will be recounted in the story of Jehus insurrection."
NABRE,12,8,26,"[6] It is unclear whether Athaliah was Omris daughter (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/8/26'>26</a>) or his granddaughter (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/8/18'>18</a>). Perhaps ""daughter"" here is being used loosely for ""female descendant."""
NABRE,12,9,1,[1] 9:1-13 Elisha carries out the commission the Lord gave Elijah in <a href='/NABRE/11/19/16'>1KG 19:16</a>. See note on <a href='/NABRE/12/3/1'>2KG 3:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/9/13'>9:13</a>.
NABRE,12,9,7,"[2] 9:7-10 The author has Elishas emissary expand considerably the speech Elisha told him to deliver by adding the same type of prophetic indictments and sanctions as were invoked on previous occasions against the dynasties of Jeroboam (<a href='/NABRE/11/14/10'>1KG 14:10-11</a>), of Baasha (<a href='/NABRE/11/16/3'>1KG 16:3-4</a>), and of Ahab himself (<a href='/NABRE/11/21/21'>1KG 21:21-24</a>)."
NABRE,12,9,14,"[3] 9:14-11:20 Death pervades this section. The dynasty founded by Omri (<a href='/NABRE/11/16/23'>1KG 16:23</a>) drowns in a bloodbath, taking numberless others along with it. The scenes are in three parallel sets of three: death comes (1) to Joram of Israel, Ahabs son; to Ahaziah of Judah, his son-in-law; and to Jezebel, the Baalist queen mother of Israel; (2) then to seventy descendants of Ahab; to forty-two relatives of Ahaziah of Judah; and to numerous Baal worshipers; (3) finally to Jehu of Israel; to the blood royal of Judah; and to Athaliah, the Baalist queen mother of Judah and last of the Omrids."
NABRE,12,9,22,[4] Harlotry and sorcery: both terms are metaphors referring to Jezebels worship of the foreign god Baal.
NABRE,12,10,6,"[1] Heads of your masters sons: Jehus command is cleverly ambiguous. He allows the Samarian leaders to understand ""heads"" either literally or metaphorically as ""most important individuals."" Then, when the leaders decapitate Ahabs potential successors, Jehu can claim to be innocent of their blood (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/10/9'>9</a>)."
NABRE,12,10,13,"[2] Since Athaliah, the queen mother in Judah, was of the Israelite royal house (<a href='/NABRE/12/8/18'>8:18, 26</a>), both the ""princes"" (lit., the ""kings sons"") and the queen mothers ""family"" (lit., her ""sons"") would belong to the royal houses of both kingdoms. They may thus be numbered among the seventy ""sons of Ahab"" killed in vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/10/1'>1-7</a>. Because ""sons"" can refer to more remote offspring, the queen mothers ""sons"" may include Ahaziahs brothers, sons, nephews, as well as the ""relatives"" (lit., the ""brothers"") of Ahaziah who are speaking in this scene."
NABRE,12,11,2,"[1] According to <a href='/NABRE/14/22/11'>2CH 22:11</a>, Jehosheba was the wife of Jehoiada, the high priest. If this is historical, it would explain her access to the Temples residential precincts."
NABRE,12,11,4,"[2] Carians: foreign mercenaries serving as the royal bodyguard. Compare ""Cherethites and Pelethites"" in <a href='/NABRE/11/1/38'>1KG 1:38</a>."
NABRE,12,11,12,"[3] Testimony: that is, the two tablets of the law preserved in the ark in the Temple. Presumably they were placed upon the king during his installation ceremony as a reminder of the law he was to uphold."

People of the land: in this period, the phrase referred to the important citizenry, whose influence sometimes extended to the selection of royal successors (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/11/14'>2KG 11:14-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/15/5'>15:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/16/15'>16:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/21/24'>21:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/6'>23:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/23/30'>30-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/24/14'>24:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/25/3'>25:3, 19</a>). In postexilic times, by contrast, the phrase was used of the poor."
NABRE,12,11,17,"[5] There are two covenants. One is between the Lord as one party and the people, headed by the king, as the other. The second covenant, between king and people, is comparable to that made between David and the elders of Israel at Hebron (<a href='/NABRE/10/5/3'>2SM 5:3</a>)."
NABRE,12,12,1,"[1] 12:1-17:5 This section recounts briefly the reigns of the last several kings of Israel and the kings of Judah contemporary with them. As always, the accounts of the kings are given in the order in which each came to the throne, without regard to which kingdom they ruled. See note on the similar section that begins in <a href='/NABRE/11/14/21'>1KG 14:21</a>."
NABRE,12,12,19,"[2] Joash: in 2 Kings the name ""Joash"" and its variant ""Jehoash"" are interchangeable (see note on ""Joram"" and ""Jehoram"" at <a href='/NABRE/12/1/17'>1:17</a>), whether in reference to the king of Judah (vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/12/1'>1-22</a>) or his slightly later contemporary, Joash of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/12/13/10'>13:10-25</a>).

NABRE,12,13,5,"[1] A savior: i.e., a military leader (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/3/9'>JUG 3:9, 15</a>). Here the identity of the savior is unclear, but the reappearance of a militant Elisha in this chapter after an absence of several chapters and nearly thirty years suggests the narrator may have had him in mind. Two generations later Joashs grandson, Jeroboam II, will also ""save"" Israel (<a href='/NABRE/12/14/27'>14:27</a>)."

In both places it disrupts the standard pattern followed in the Books of Kings. The account of Joashs reign ends in vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/13/12'>12-13</a>; this leaves the story of Elishas last illness (in which Joash figures prominently) suspended between regnal accounts, much as the story of Elishas succession to Elijahs prophetic office (chap. <a href='/NABRE/12/2/1'>2</a>) was suspended between the accounts of Ahaziah and Joram. In <a href='/NABRE/12/14/15'>14:15-16</a> the concluding formula for Joashs reign interrupts the account of the reign of Amaziah of Judah (<a href='/NABRE/12/14/1'>14:1-22</a>), much as Joash himself invaded Amaziahs kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/12/14/11'>14:11-14</a>)."

The kings of Judah between Athaliah and Ahaz are assigned too many years in all to correspond to the reigns in Israel from Jehu to the fall of Samaria. Various theories have been proposed in an attempt to explain the discrepancy, such as co-regencies, or textual corruption in the process of transmission."

NABRE,12,15,27,[4] The twenty years here ascribed to Pekah are difficult to reconcile with other chronological notices about the kings. One theory would see Pekah and Menahem as rival kings over parts of a divided Israelite territory; this could explain Menahems concern for Assyrian support (vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/15/19'>19-20</a>) and Assyrias attack on Pekah (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/15/29'>29</a>).

NABRE,12,15,30,"[5] The twenty years here reckoned to Jotham of Judah may include his co-regency with Azariah (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/15/5'>5</a>); otherwise they are impossible to reconcile with v. <a href='/NABRE/12/15/33'>33</a>, which ascribes him only sixteen years. The verse also appears to contradict <a href='/NABRE/12/16/1'>16:1</a>, which has Jothams son and successor, Ahaz, coming to the throne while Pekah still reigns in Israel, and <a href='/NABRE/12/17/1'>17:1</a>, which dates Hosheas accession to the throne to the twelfth year of Ahaz."

These data make it possible to connect the chronology of Israel and Judah to the larger chronology of ancient Near Eastern history, but they also complicate further the already vexed problem of inconsistencies in the biblical data about accession years and lengths of reign."

NABRE,12,17,6,"[3] 17:6-41 This brief section is the Deuteronomistic historians theological reflection on the causes and aftermath of Assyrias conquest of the Northern Kingdom. The text contrasts the Israelites, who were deported (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/6'>6</a>) because they abandoned the worship of the Lord (vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/7'>7-23</a>), with the foreigners who were brought into the land (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/24'>24</a>) and undertook, however imperfectly, to worship the Lord alongside their own traditional deities (vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/25'>25-34</a>a). The last verses recapitulate the apostasy of the Israelites (vv. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/34'>34b</a>-40) and the syncretism of the foreigners (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/17/41'>41</a>).

Since Sennacheribs invasion in the fourteenth year of Hezekiah (v. <a href='/NABRE/12/18/13'>13</a>) took place in 701, Hezekiah cannot have been on the throne twenty years earlier. Various solutions have been proposed: scribal errors in writing the numbers; a Hezekian co-regency with his father Ahaz beginning in 729; etc. None of the solutions has won a consensus among historians."

If the coalition had succeeded, it could have broken Assyrian control over the whole region, including Samaria, and allowed the kingdom of Israel to free itself. When Assyria crushed the coalition, it also crushed Israels hopes for liberation."

NABRE,12,20,12,"[1] Berodach-baladan: this famous kings name is more correctly recorded in <a href='/NABRE/23/39/1'>ISA 39:1</a> as ""Merodach-baladan."" The Babylonian form, Marduk-apal-idinna, means ""Marduk has granted a son."" Historically, any embassy from him to Hezekiah must have been aimed at establishing an anti-Assyrian strategy of cooperation."

NABRE,12,23,10,"[2] Topheth…by fire: Topheth was a cultic site probably in the Hinnom Valley just west of Jerusalem where, apparently, children were immolated to the deity Molech (Hebrew melek, ""king,"" deformed in the biblical tradition to ""Molech""). The practice was condemned by Deuteronomic law and denounced by Jeremiah (<a href='/NABRE/5/12/31'>DEU 12:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/29'>JER 7:29-31</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/24/19/1'>JER 19</a> the deity is identified as the Canaanite god Baal."
NABRE,12,23,13,"[3] Mount of the Destroyer: the name of the mountain in Hebrew is a wordplay. ""The Mount of the mashchit"" means ""the Mount of the Destroyer"" or perhaps ""the Mount of Destruction."" The word plays on mishchah, ""anointment,"" and on mashiach, ""anointed one,"" both of which are references to the ceremony that consecrated the king. The mountain in question was the Mount of Olives, whose trees produced oil for the royal anointing. In the present context, both sides of the wordplay allude to Solomon, the anointed king (mashiach), whose building of non-Yahwistic shrines on this very mountain resulted in the destruction (mashchit) of the Davidic realm (see <a href='/NABRE/11/11/4'>1KG 11:4-13</a>). Horror…abomination: all three idols are described with pejorative terms."
NABRE,12,23,18,[4] From Samaria: an anachronistic use of the name of the later capital city for the whole region. The prophet was from Bethel; cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/13/11'>1KG 13:11</a>.

NABRE,12,23,29,"[6] Against the king of Assyria: the narrator depicts Necos advance as an attack on Assyrian forces. The Babylonian record of the event, however, implies that Neco intended to support the remnant of Assyrian forces against a Babylonian onslaught in order to prop up a buffer state between Egypt and Babylon and assure Egyptian control of the Syro-Palestinian region."
NABRE,12,23,33,"[7] A talent of gold: unless the fine imposed was a mere token, this figure seems too low; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/18/14'>18:14</a>. A number may have dropped from the Hebrew text; various ancient translations read ""ten"" or ""one hundred"" here."

NABRE,13,1,1,"[1] 1:1-9:34 The Chroniclers intention seems to have been to retell, from his particular viewpoint, the story of Gods people from creation down to his own day. Since his primary interest was the history of David and the Davidic dynasty of Judah, he hurries through everything that preceded the death of Saul, Davids predecessor as king, by the use of genealogical lists. The sources for these genealogies are mostly the books, already largely in their present form in the Chroniclers time, that eventually formed the Hebrew canon.

NABRE,13,2,3,"[1] 2:3-4:23 The Chronicler had two reasons for placing his genealogy of the tribe of Judah before those of the other tribes, and for making it longer than all the others: his interest in David, who was of the tribe of Judah; and the prominence of descendants of that tribe among the Jews of the Chroniclers time."

If twenty-five years are allowed for each generation, the ten generations between Jeconiah and Anani (the last name on the list) would put the birth of the latter at about 405 B.C.—an important item in establishing the approximate date of the Chroniclers work in its final form."

NABRE,13,18,17,"[2] Chief assistants to the king: according to <a href='/NABRE/10/8/18'>2SM 8:18</a>, the Chroniclers source here, Davids sons were priests. The Chroniclers modification reflects his conviction that only Aarons descendants could be priests."
NABRE,13,20,1,"[1] At the turn of the year: thus in <a href='/NABRE/10/11/1'>2SM 11</a> begins the story of Davids adultery with Bathsheba and his murder of her husband Uriah, but the Chronicler omits it."
NABRE,13,20,5,"[2] Elhanan…slew Lahmi, the brother of Goliath: with this notice the Chronicler solves the difficulty of the apparent contradiction between <a href='/NABRE/9/17/49'>1SM 17:49, 51</a> (David killed Goliath) and <a href='/NABRE/10/21/19'>2SM 21:19</a> (Elhanan killed Goliath)."
NABRE,13,21,1,"[1] A satan: in the parallel passage (<a href='/NABRE/10/24/1'>2SM 24:1</a>) David is led astray because of the Lords anger. The Chroniclers modification reflects the changed theological outlook of postexilic Israel, when evil was no longer attributed directly to God. At an earlier period the Hebrew word satan(""adversary,"" or, especially in a court of law, ""accuser"") designated both human beings (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/14'>1KG 11:14</a>) and a ""son of God"" who accused people before God (<a href='/NABRE/18/1/6'>JOB 1:6-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/2/1'>2:1-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/3/1'>ZEC 3:1-2</a>). In later Judaism (cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/2/24'>WIS 2:24</a>) and in the New Testament, satan, or the ""devil"" (from diablos, the Greek translation of the Hebrew word), designates an evil spirit who tempts people to do wrong."
NABRE,13,21,25,"[2] Six hundred shekels of gold: according to <a href='/NABRE/10/24/24'>2SM 24:24</a>, David paid only fifty shekels of silver for Ornans threshing floor; the Chroniclers higher figure reflects the value the site of the future Temple had in his eyes."
NABRE,13,22,2,"[1] 22:2-4 According to <a href='/NABRE/11/5/15'>1KG 5:15-32</a>, Solomon himself made the material preparations for building the Temple, even though David had wished to do so (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/17'>1KG 5:17-19</a>). The Chronicler, however, seeks to enhance Davids role in the building of the Temple."
NABRE,13,22,9,"[2] The Hebrew word for peace, shalom, is reflected in the name Solomon, in Hebrew, Shelomo. The Chronicler draws a contrast here between Solomon, the ""peaceful man,"" and David, who ""waged great wars"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/13/22/8'>8</a>). David was prevented from building the Temple, not only because his time was taken up in waging war (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/17'>1KG 5:17</a>), but also because he shed much blood (<a href='/NABRE/13/22/8'>1CH 22:8</a>), thereby making himself, in the Chroniclers view, ritually unfit for the task."
NABRE,13,22,14,"[3] A hundred thousand talents of gold: about 3,775 tons of gold. A million talents of silver: about 37,750 tons of silver. These highly exaggerated figures are intended to stress the inestimable value of the Temple as the center of Israelite worship. More modest figures are given in <a href='/NABRE/11/9/14'>1KG 9:14, 28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/10/10'>10:10, 14</a>."

NABRE,13,25,1,"[1] This list of twenty-four classes of Temple singers balances the list of the twenty-four classes of priests (<a href='/NABRE/13/24/4'>24:4-19</a>). The last nine names in v. <a href='/NABRE/13/25/4'>4</a>, which seem to form a special group, were perhaps originally fragments or incipits (the opening words) of hymns. With some slight changes in the vocalization, these names would mean: ""Have mercy on me, O Lord,"" ""Have mercy on me,"" ""You are my God,"" ""I magnify,"" ""I extol the help of…,"" ""Sitting in adversity,"" ""I have fulfilled,"" ""He made abundant,"" and ""Visions."""
NABRE,13,26,18,"[1] The large building: parbar, mentioned also in <a href='/NABRE/12/23/11'>2KG 23:11</a>; the meaning of the word is unclear."

NABRE,13,27,1,"[1] 27:1-15 This list of army commanders is similar to, but distinct from, the list of Davids warriors given in <a href='/NABRE/13/11/10'>11:10-47</a>. The schematic enumeration of the soldiers presented here appears artificial and exaggerated (12 x 24,000 = 288,000 men!). However, the Hebrew word (eleph) translated ""thousand"" might also designate a military unit of much smaller size."
NABRE,13,27,34,"[2] After Ahithophel: after Ahithophels suicide (<a href='/NABRE/10/17/23'>2SM 17:23</a>), Jehoiada succeeded him as the kings counselor. Abiathar: Davids priest, along with Zadok. See note on <a href='/NABRE/13/18/16'>18:16</a>."
NABRE,13,28,2,"[1] The ark…the footstool…of our God: the Lord, who was invisibly enthroned upon the cherubim associated with the ark of the covenant at Shiloh and later in the Jerusalem Temple, had the ark as his footstool; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/99/5'>PS 99:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/132/7'>132:7</a>. There was no ark in the postexilic Temple. Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/14/5/9'>2CH 5:9</a>."

NABRE,13,29,22,[1] For a second time: the first time is in <a href='/NABRE/13/23/1'>23:1</a> where David appoints Solomon his successor. Now there is a solemn public ratification of that appointment.
NABRE,14,1,5,"[1] The bronze altar…the tabernacle of the Lord: by this notice, the Chronicler justifies Solomons worship at the high place of Gibeon. He pictures the tabernacle, i.e., the Mosaic meeting tent, and the bronze altar made at Moses command (<a href='/NABRE/2/31/1'>EXO 31:1-9</a>) as remaining at Gibeon after David had installed the ark of the covenant in another tent in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/13/15/1'>1CH 15:1, 25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/16/1'>16:1</a>). Bezalels altar was made of acacia wood plated with bronze (<a href='/NABRE/2/27/1'>EXO 27:1-2</a>). Later, Solomon made an all-bronze altar for the Temple in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/14/4/1'>2CH 4:1</a>)."
NABRE,14,1,16,"[2] 1:16-17 Egypt and Cilicia: it seems likely that the horses came from Cilicia and the chariots from Egypt. Some scholars find a reference to Musur, a mountain district north of Cilicia, rather than to Egypt (Misrayim) in <a href='/NABRE/11/10/28'>1KG 10:28-29</a>, the Chroniclers source for this notice. The Chronicler himself probably understood the source to be speaking of Egypt; cf. <a href='/NABRE/14/9/28'>2CH 9:28</a>."

In between (vv. <a href='/NABRE/15/4/6'>6-23</a>) is a series of notices about opposition to the returned exiles voiced at the Persian court in the early fifth century B.C., after the Temple had been built."
NABRE,15,4,6,[4] Ahasuerus: Xerxes (486-465 B.C.); the early years of his reign were occupied with revolts in several parts of the empire.
NABRE,15,4,7,[5] There is a note placed in the original text to indicate a change from Hebrew to Aramaic. The Aramaic section beginning here ends with <a href='/NABRE/15/6/18'>6:18</a>; in <a href='/NABRE/15/7/12'>7:12-26</a> a royal letter is cited in Aramaic.
NABRE,15,4,8,"[6] 4:8-23 The letter to Artaxerxes I (465-424 B.C.) deals with the building of the fortification walls of Jerusalem, not the building of the Temple. The interruption of the work on the city wall some time before 445 B.C. was the occasion for the arrival of Nehemiah in the province (<a href='/NABRE/16/1/1'>NEH 1:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/2/1'>2:1-5</a>)."
NABRE,15,4,10,[7] Osnappar: probably Ashurbanipal; see note on <a href='/NABRE/15/4/2'>4:2</a>.
NABRE,15,4,14,[8] Eat the salt of the palace: the idiom signifies sharing in the benefits of the palace.
NABRE,15,4,24,"[9] The second year…of Darius: that is, 520 B.C.; it marks the beginning of the successful restoration of the Temple, completed within the five years following (<a href='/NABRE/15/5/1'>5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/15/6/18'>6:18</a>)."
NABRE,15,5,1,[1] The prophets Haggai and Zechariah: Haggai and Zechariah were active during the early years of Darius I. They document the rebuilding of the Temple and the messianic expectations associated with the Davidic descendant Zerubbabel.
NABRE,15,6,1,"[1] 6:1-2 Babylon was the capital city of the satrapy to which Judah belonged; it was therefore the natural place to look. The decree was discovered eventually, however, in Ecbatana (Hamadan), the former capital of the Medes and summer residence of the Persian kings. Cf. the Hebrew version of the decree (<a href='/NABRE/15/1/2'>1:2-4</a>)."
NABRE,15,6,22,"[2] The king of Assyria: ""Assyria"" is perhaps used in a broad sense for the Persian empire; or the editor may have in mind the account of Hezekiahs Passover which refers to those who had escaped the hand of the king of Assyria (<a href='/NABRE/14/30/6'>2CH 30:6</a>)."
NABRE,15,7,1,"[1] 7:1-10 The editors introduction to Ezras autobiographical narrative. The context suggests the seventh year of Artaxerxes I, therefore, 458 B.C., as the date of Ezras arrival in Jerusalem. The arguments often advanced for 398 B.C., the seventh year of Artaxerxes II, or less often for the thirty-seventh year of Artaxerxes I, that is, 428 B.C., are inconclusive. For Ezras descent from Aaron, the editor has drawn selectively on <a href='/NABRE/13/5/27'>1CH 5:27-41</a>. Seraiah, the chief priest executed by the Babylonians after the fall of Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/12/25/18'>2KG 25:18-21</a>), cannot be Ezras father in a literal sense, and Ezra was not himself high priest."

NABRE,15,7,25,"[3] The wisdom of your God: with reference to the law (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/4/6'>DEU 4:6</a>). The law in question was certainly not new, since it was assumed to be known by Jews in Judah and elsewhere. It corresponded to Pentateuchal law, though perhaps this had not yet been given its final form."
NABRE,15,8,15,"[1] Ahava: an unidentified location near Babylon; also the name of the river or canal on which it stood (vv. <a href='/NABRE/15/8/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/15/8/31'>31</a>). A location near water was dictated by ritual as well as practical reasons (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/137/1'>PS 137:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/1/1'>EZE 1:1, 3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/3/15'>3:15</a>)."
NABRE,15,8,36,"[2] The story of Ezras mission is apparently continued from this point by <a href='/NABRE/16/7/72'>NEH 7:72</a>b-8:18, which may be read before <a href='/NABRE/15/9/1'>EZR 9:1</a>."
NABRE,15,9,4,"[1] All who were in dread…God of Israel: lit., ""all who trembled""; these people are also mentioned at <a href='/NABRE/15/10/3'>10:3</a>, and a similar designation occurs at <a href='/NABRE/23/66/2'>ISA 66:2, 5</a>, a text more or less contemporary with this passage. The allusion may be to a distinct social group of rigorist tendencies who supported Ezras marriage reform."
NABRE,15,9,6,"[2] 9:6-15 The prayer attributed to Ezra is a communal confession of sin, of a kind characteristic of the Second Temple period (cf. <a href='/NABRE/16/9/6'>NEH 9:6-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/9/4'>DAN 9:4-19</a>; 1QS 1:4-2:1), but adapted to the present situation."
NABRE,15,10,6,"[1] Johanan, son of Eliashib: if this Eliashib is identical with the high priest of that name during Nehemiahs mission (<a href='/NABRE/16/3/1'>NEH 3:1</a>), it would be difficult to avoid the conclusion that Ezra followed Nehemiah. But Eliashib is a common name, and, on the hypothesis of Nehemiahs chronological priority, it would be unlikely that Ezra would consort with a family which had ""defiled the priesthood"" (<a href='/NABRE/16/13/28'>NEH 13:28-29</a>)."
NABRE,15,10,9,"[2] The ninth month: Kislev (November-December), during the first of two rainy seasons in Palestine."
NABRE,15,10,16,"[3] 10:16-17 The work of the committee lasted three months, from the first day of the tenth month, Tebeth (December-January), to the first day of the first month, Nisan (March-April), of the following year."
NABRE,15,10,44,"[4] Some scholars find the continuation of the account of the marriage reform in <a href='/NABRE/16/9/1'>NEH 9:1-5</a>, though the date given at <a href='/NABRE/16/9/1'>NEH 9:1</a> would fit better after <a href='/NABRE/15/10/15'>EZR 10:15</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/10'>HAG 2:10-14</a>. The abrupt conclusion to <a href='/NABRE/15/9/1'>EZR 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/15/10/1'>10</a> suggests that the policy of forced separation from foreign wives, not mandated by any law known to us, did not succeed. Assuming the chronological priority of Ezra, marriage outside the community was still prevalent during Nehemiahs administration, and the remarkable demographic expansion of Judaism in the following centuries would be difficult to explain if Ezras measures had been put into effect."
NABRE,16,1,1,"[1] The first mission of Nehemiah, from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes I, lasted from the spring (<a href='/NABRE/16/2/1'>2:1</a>) of 445 B.C. until 433 B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/16/5/14'>5:14</a>). It is recounted in <a href='/NABRE/16/1/1'>1:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/16/6/15'>6:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/12/27'>12:27-43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/6/16'>6:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/16/7/5'>7:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/11/1'>11:1-21</a>; in terms of chronology, these texts may usefully be read in that order. Kislev: the ninth month (November-December). Susa: the winter residence of the Persian kings, in southwest Iran."
NABRE,16,1,5,"[2] Nehemiahs prayer is a communal confession of sin, characteristic of Second Temple piety; cf. <a href='/NABRE/15/9/6'>EZR 9:6-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/9/6'>NEH 9:6-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/9/4'>DAN 9:4-19</a>."
NABRE,16,1,11,[3] Cupbearer to the king: an important official in the royal household.
NABRE,16,2,10,"[1] Sanballat the Horonite: the governor of the province of Samaria (<a href='/NABRE/16/3/33'>3:33-34</a>), apparently a native of one of the Beth-horons. A letter from the Jews living at Elephantine in southern Egypt, dated 408-407 B.C., mentions ""Delayah and Shelemyah, the sons of Sanballat, the governor of Samaria,"" and papyri discovered in the Wadi ed-Dâliyeh in the Jordan Valley refer to a Sanballat, governor of Samaria, during the last years of Persian rule. Although his own name was Babylonian—Sin-uballit, i.e., ""Sin (the moon god) has given life""—his two sons had names based on the divine name Yhwh. Tobiah the Ammonite official: the governor of the province of Ammon in Transjordan. His title, ""official,"" lit., ""servant"" (in Hebrew, ebed), could also be understood as ""slave,"" and Nehemiah perhaps meant it in this derogatory sense. The Tobiads remained a powerful family even in Maccabean times, and something of their history is known from 2 Maccabees (<a href='/NABRE/16/3/11'>3:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/12/17'>12:17</a>), Josephus (Ant. 12:160-236), the Zeno papyri of the third century B.C., and excavation at Araq el-Emir in Jordan. Sanballat and Tobiah, together with Geshem the Arab (<a href='/NABRE/16/2/19'>NEH 2:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/6/1'>6:1-2</a>), who was probably in charge of Edom and the regions to the south and southeast of Judah, opposed the rebuilding of Jerusalems walls on political grounds; the city was the capital of a rival province."
NABRE,16,2,13,"[2] 2:13-15 Nehemiah left Jerusalem by the Valley Gate near the northwestern end of the old City of David and went south down the Tyropoean Valley toward the Dragon Spring (or the En-rogel [<a href='/NABRE/6/15/7'>JOS 15:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/18/16'>18:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/17/17'>2SM 17:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/1/9'>1KG 1:9</a>], now known as Jobs Well) at the juncture of the Valley of Hinnom and the Kidron Valley. He then turned north at the Dung Gate (or the Potsherd Gate of <a href='/NABRE/24/19/2'>JER 19:2</a>) at the southern end of the city and proceeded up the wadi, that is, the Kidron Valley, passing the Fountain Gate (at the Spring of Gihon) and the Kings Pool (unidentified); finally he turned west and then south to his starting point."
NABRE,16,2,19,"[3] Geshem the Arab: see also <a href='/NABRE/16/6/1'>6:1-2</a>; in <a href='/NABRE/16/6/6'>6:6</a> the name occurs as Gashmu. He is known from a contemporary inscription as ruler of the Kedarite Arabs, who were threatening Judah from the south and east."
NABRE,16,2,20,"[4] Neither share nor claim nor memorial: although Sanballat and Tobiah worshiped Yhwh, Nehemiah would not let them participate in any of the activities of the religious community in Jerusalem."
NABRE,16,3,1,"[1] 3:1-32 The construction work on the gates and walls of the city is described in counterclockwise direction, beginning and ending at the Sheep Gate (to the north of the Temple). The exact locations of many of the topographical points mentioned are uncertain."
NABRE,16,3,6,"[2] The Mishneh Gate: the gate leading into the second, expanded quarter of the city; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/22/14'>2KG 22:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/36/1/10'>ZEP 1:10</a>."

NABRE,16,6,15,"[2] Elul: the sixth month (August-September). Fifty-two days: according to Josephus (Ant. 11:174-183), the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem by Nehemiah took two years and four months."

NABRE,16,8,1,"[1] 8:1-18 Chronologically this belongs after <a href='/NABRE/15/8/36'>EZR 8:36</a>. The gloss mentioning Nehemiah in <a href='/NABRE/16/8/9'>NEH 8:9</a> was inserted in this Ezra section after the dislocation of several parts of Ezra-Nehemiah had occurred. There is no clear evidence of a simultaneous presence of Nehemiah and Ezra in Jerusalem; <a href='/NABRE/16/12/26'>NEH 12:26, 36</a> are also scribal glosses."
NABRE,16,9,1,"[1] 9:1-5 The feast of Booths is followed by a penitential liturgy. Since it includes separation from foreigners, some read it as a sequel to <a href='/NABRE/15/9/1'>EZR 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/15/10/1'>10</a>."
NABRE,16,9,6,[2] 9:6-37 The Septuagint attributes the prayer to Ezra; cf. <a href='/NABRE/15/9/6'>EZR 9:6-15</a>.
NABRE,16,9,16,"[3] They were obdurate: lit., ""they stiffened their necks."""
NABRE,16,10,1,"[1] 10:1-39 This section belongs to the Nehemiah narrative rather than to that of Ezra. It is best read after <a href='/NABRE/16/13/31'>NEH 13:31</a>, since the stipulations of the pact seem to presuppose Nehemiahs measures recorded in <a href='/NABRE/16/13/1'>NEH 13</a>. In view of all this: considering the situation described in <a href='/NABRE/16/13/4'>NEH 13:4-31</a>."
NABRE,16,11,1,[1] 11:1-19 This list of the family heads who lived in Jerusalem at the time of Nehemiah is best read after <a href='/NABRE/16/7/72'>NEH 7:72</a>. It parallels at many points the list of early settlers in <a href='/NABRE/13/9/2'>1CH 9:2-17</a>.
NABRE,16,12,10,"[1] 12:10-11 Jeshua was the high priest when Zerubbabel was governor, in the last decades of the sixth century B.C.

He was the grandfather of Eliashib, the high priest early in Nehemiahs governorship (445-433 B.C.; <a href='/NABRE/16/3/1'>NEH 3:1, 20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/16/3/21'>21</a>) and perhaps later. Eliashib, the grandfather of Johanan, was a grown man, if not yet a high priest, at the time of Ezra, ca. 400 B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/15/10/6'>EZR 10:6</a>; and note). According to Josephus (Ant. 11:120-183), whose testimony here is doubtful, Jaddua, son of Johanan, died as an old man about the time that Alexander the Great died, 323 B.C. If, as seems probable, this list of the postexilic high priests, at least as far as Johanan, comes from the author himself (cf. <a href='/NABRE/16/12/23'>NEH 12:23</a>) and not from a later scribe, it is of prime importance for dating the authors work in the first decades of the fourth century B.C."
NABRE,16,12,27,"[2] 12:27-43 The dedication of the wall of Jerusalem took place, no doubt, soon after the restoration of the wall and its gates had been completed. This section, therefore, is best read after <a href='/NABRE/16/6/15'>NEH 6:15</a>."
NABRE,16,12,44,[3] 12:44-47 This account of the provisions made for the Temple services is a composition either of the author or of a later scribe. The gloss mentioning Nehemiah is not in the Septuagint.
NABRE,16,13,1,[1] 13:1-3 These verses serve as an introduction to the reforms Nehemiah instituted during his second mission in Jerusalem (vv. <a href='/NABRE/16/13/4'>4-31</a>). The part of the Book of Moses read to the people is freely quoted here from <a href='/NABRE/5/23/3'>DEU 23:3-6</a>.

NABRE,68,1,5,[3] Jeroboam established sanctuaries in Dan and Bethel so that the people would no longer have to go to Jerusalem for the festivals. The gold statues of calves that he placed in the sanctuaries were considered the throne of Yhwh; but the people may have tended to worship the images themselves. Jeroboam also encouraged high places or hilltop shrines (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/26'>1KG 12:26-33</a>).

NABRE,68,5,3,"[1] Bond: a document called in Greek cheirographon. In the Middle Ages, notably in England, a deed and its duplicate were written on one piece of parchment, with the Latin word chirographuminscribed across the top of the sheet or between the two copies of the text. The document was then cut in two in either a straight or a wavy line, the parts being given to the persons concerned. Perhaps this procedure was derived from the present verse of Tobit. Duplicate documents, usually one part open and the other sealed, are well known from the ancient Near East."
NABRE,68,5,4,[2] He did not know: the theme of an angel in disguise occurs frequently in folklore as well as in the Old Testament (<a href='/NABRE/1/18/1'>GEN 18</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/13/2'>HEB 13:2</a>).
NABRE,68,5,6,"[3] It is a good two days journey from Ecbatana to Rages: Alexanders army took eleven days in forced marches to cover this distance, about 180 miles. (See notes on <a href='/NABRE/68/1/15'>1:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/3/7'>3:7</a> and Introduction.)"

NABRE,68,6,18,"[4] Get up to pray: prayer, combined with ritual action, drives out the demon."
NABRE,68,7,11,"[1] You are her brother, and she is your sister: the marriage formula is similar to a marriage contract from the fifth century B.C. found at Elephantine in Egypt: ""She is my wife and I am her husband from this day forever."""
NABRE,68,8,2,"[1] 8:2-3 The manner of coping with demonic influences among the ancients seems strange to us. However, the fish here is a folktale element, suggesting the heros fight with a dragon, and not a recipe for exorcism. It is clear that the author places primary emphasis on the value of prayer to God (<a href='/NABRE/68/6/18'>6:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/8/4'>8:4-8</a>), on the role of the angel as Gods agent, and on the pious disposition of Tobiah."

NABRE,68,12,5,"[2] 12:6-10 In the fashion of a wisdom teacher, Raphael gives the two men a short exhortation similar to the one Tobit gave his son in <a href='/NABRE/68/4/3'>4:3-19</a>."
NABRE,68,12,6,"[3] 12:6-7 The faithful considered the praise of God their most esteemed privilege. Without it, life was meaningless; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/38/16'>ISA 38:16-20</a>."
NABRE,68,12,12,"[4] Raphael is one of the seven Angels of the Presence, specially designated intercessors who present prayers to God. Angelology was developing in this period. The names of two other of these seven angels are given in the Bible: Gabriel (<a href='/NABRE/27/8/16'>DAN 8:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/9/21'>9:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/1/19'>LUK 1:19, 26</a>) and Michael (<a href='/NABRE/27/10/13'>DAN 10:13, 21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/12/1'>12:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/65/1/9'>JUD 1:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/12/7'>REV 12:7</a>). See 1 Enoch for the names of the rest."
NABRE,68,13,1,"[1] 13:1-18 Tobits hymn of praise is divided into two parts. The first part (vv. <a href='/NABRE/68/13/1'>1-8</a>) is a song of praise that echoes themes from the psalms; the second (vv. <a href='/NABRE/68/13/9'>9-18</a>) is addressed to Jerusalem in the style of those prophets who spoke of a new and ideal Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>ISA 60</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/66/21/1'>REV 21</a>). Joyful praise: words for joy and gladness occur throughout this prayer (vv. <a href='/NABRE/68/13/1'>1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/7'>7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/10'>10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/11'>11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/13'>13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/14'>14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/16'>16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/68/13/18'>18</a>)."
NABRE,68,13,9,[2] Works of your hands: idols.
NABRE,68,14,4,"[1] 14:4-5 Nahum: one of the minor prophets, whose book contains oracles of doom against Nineveh. Here, in keeping with the period in which the story is set, the author makes Tobit speak as if the punishment of Nineveh, the destruction of Jerusalem (587 B.C.), the exile from Judah and the return, would all take place in the future. The technique of using the facts of past history as seemingly future predictions is a frequent device of apocalyptic writers. The good land: a favorite name for the promised land. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/1/35'>DEU 1:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/3/25'>3:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/21'>4:21-22</a>."
NABRE,68,14,5,"[2] Until the era…completed: a reference to the coming of the day of the Lord, when a new, more perfect temple was to be expected. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/9/1'>HEB 9:1-14</a>."
NABRE,68,14,6,[3] Conversion of the nations is also to come with the day of the Lord.
NABRE,68,14,10,"[4] Nadin: in the Story of Ahiqar, the hero Ahiqar, chancellor under the Assyrian kings Sennacherib and Esarhaddon, adopts his nephew Nadin and prepares him to become his successor. But Nadin treacherously plots to have his uncle put to death. Ahiqar hides in a friends house and is finally vindicated when Nadins scheme is discovered. Thereupon Nadin is thrown into a dungeon where he dies. It was Ahiqars almsgiving that delivered him from death; see note on <a href='/NABRE/68/2/2'>2:2</a>. The Greek and Latin versions of the Book of Tobit read the name as Nadab, but the Aramaic form has the ancient name Nadin, which is also found in the fifth-century B.C. Aramaic Story of Ahiqar."
NABRE,68,14,15,"[5] Cyaxares: Nabopolassar, king of Babylon, and Cyaxares conquered and destroyed Nineveh in 612 B.C.; see note on <a href='/NABRE/68/1/15'>1:15</a>."
NABRE,69,1,1,"[1] 1:1-3:10 This section consists of an introduction to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href='/NABRE/69/1/1'>1:1-16</a>), his commissioning of Holofernes (<a href='/NABRE/69/2/1'>2:1-13</a>), and a description of the campaigns Holofernes leads against the disobedient vassal nations of the west (<a href='/NABRE/69/2/14'>2:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/69/3/10'>3:10</a>)."
NABRE,69,1,1,"[2] 1:1-16 Introduction to Nebuchadnezzar and his campaign against Arphaxad. Nebuchadnezzar (605/4-562 B.C.), the most famous Neo-Babylonian king, destroyed Jerusalem in 587 B.C., the eighteenth year of his reign (see <a href='/NABRE/24/32/1'>JER 32:1</a>). His depiction here as an Assyrian is an invention of the author, as is the description of Arphaxad, an otherwise unknown king of the Medes, in Ecbatana."
NABRE,69,1,1,"[3] Twelfth year: in the twelfth year of Nebuchadnezzar (593 B.C.) Zedekiah, king of Judah, refused to join a revolt against him (see <a href='/NABRE/24/27/3'>JER 27:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/28/1'>28:1</a>). Nineveh: capital of Assyria, destroyed in 612 B.C."
NABRE,69,1,2,"[4] 1:2-4 Since a cubit was the distance from the elbow to the fingertip (approximately eighteen inches), these dimensions are prodigious. The massive wall around Ecbatana is described as 105 feet high and 75 feet thick, with each stone measuring four and a half feet thick and nine feet long. The tower gates are 150 feet high and 60 feet wide. Such unlikely massive structures have never been found at Ecbatana, which lies beneath the modern city of Hamadan, located in the Zagros mountains of northwest Iran. Ecbatana is mentioned in vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/1/1'>1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/1/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/1/14'>14</a> as Arphaxads headquarters. Tradition claims Esther and Mordecai are buried there."
NABRE,69,1,5,"[5] Ragau, the place where Arphaxad is slain (v. <a href='/NABRE/69/1/15'>15</a>), one of the oldest settlements in Iran, is located on a plain one hundred miles northeast of Ecbatana. In the Book of Tobit it is the home of Gabael (<a href='/NABRE/68/1/14'>TOB 1:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/4/1'>4:1, 20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/5/6'>5:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/6/13'>6:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/9/2'>9:2, 5</a>)."
NABRE,69,1,6,"[6] Chelodites: Greek Cheleoud, probably a corruption of ""Chaldeans,"" i.e., the Neo-Babylonians."
NABRE,69,1,7,"[7] Mention of Persia suggests a postexilic setting for the book, since this area would have been designated Media before the middle of the fifth century B.C."
NABRE,69,1,11,"[8] References to ""the whole land,"" ""all the land"" are used ten times in the first two chapters (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/1/11'>11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/1/12'>12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/2/1'>2:1, 2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/2/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/2/6'>6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/2/7'>7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/2/9'>9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/2/10'>10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/2/19'>19</a>). This signifies all the nations west of Persia as far as Egypt that were subject to Nebuchadnezzar, i.e., the whole earth or world (esp. 2:9). These and similar formulations throughout the book build the case that the ""God of heaven"" (<a href='/NABRE/69/5/8'>5:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/6/19'>6:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/11/17'>11:17</a>) is the true ""Master of heaven and earth"" (<a href='/NABRE/69/9/12'>9:12</a>)."
NABRE,69,1,12,"[9] The two seas: probably the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf, though possibly the Red Sea and Mediterranean."
NABRE,69,1,13,"[10] Seventeenth year: 588 B.C. Without help from the vassal nations, Nebuchadnezzar defeats Arphaxad."
NABRE,69,2,1,[1] 2:1-13 Nebuchadnezzar commissions Holofernes to take vengeance on the vassal nations that refused him auxiliary military support (see <a href='/NABRE/69/1/7'>1:7-12</a>).
NABRE,69,2,1,"[2] Eighteenth year: 587 B.C. Most of the story is set in the catastrophic year when the historical Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, destroyed Jerusalem."
NABRE,69,2,4,[3] The ranking general: Holofernes is so identified six times in Judith. See also <a href='/NABRE/69/4/1'>4:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/5/1'>5:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/6/1'>6:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/10/13'>10:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/13/15'>13:15</a>. Holofernes and Bagoas (<a href='/NABRE/69/12/11'>12:11</a>) are Persian names; two officers of Artaxerxes III Ochos (358-338 B.C.) were so named.
NABRE,69,2,7,"[4] Earth and water: in the Persian period, offering these to a conqueror was a symbolic gesture signifying humble submission of one asking for a treaty."
NABRE,69,2,12,"[5] As I live: an oath proper to God; see the promissory oath of God the divine warrior in <a href='/NABRE/5/32/39'>DEU 32:39-42</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/49/18'>ISA 49:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/22/24'>JER 22:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/5/11'>EZE 5:11</a>. By my own hand: in his pride, Nebuchadnezzar claims to do this by his own hand (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/10/13'>ISA 10:13</a>). In contrast, Judith claims that God will deliver Israel ""by my hand"" (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/33'>8:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/12/4'>12:4</a>)."
NABRE,69,2,13,"[6] 2:14-3:10 As Holofernes attacks the western nations, terror sweeps across the empire at large (<a href='/NABRE/69/2/28'>2:28</a>), then Judea (<a href='/NABRE/69/4/1'>4:1-2</a>), and finally Bethulia (<a href='/NABRE/69/7/1'>7:1</a>). In these verses, the line of advance is from Nineveh to Damascus and all who submit are nonetheless devastated and forced to worship Nebuchadnezzar."
NABRE,69,2,21,[7] A three-day march: no ancient army could have traveled three hundred miles from Nineveh to Cilicia in three days.
NABRE,69,2,23,"[8] Put and Lud: mentioned together in <a href='/NABRE/24/46/9'>JER 46:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/27/10'>EZE 27:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/30/5'>30:5</a>. Put is thought to be in Libya in Africa; Lud is usually identified with Lydia in Asia Minor. Rather than indicating definite localities here, Put and Lud add assonance and prophetic overtones to the narrative."
NABRE,69,2,28,"[9] Symbolic of the completeness of the terror that descended on the area, seven towns are listed: Tyre, Sidon, Sur, Ocina, Jamnia, Ashdod, and Ashkelon."
NABRE,69,3,8,"[1] Invoke him as a god: Holofernes violates Nebuchadnezzars instructions (see <a href='/NABRE/69/2/5'>2:5-13</a>). No Assyrian, Neo-Babylonian, or Persian king is known to have claimed divinity. During Hellenistic times, Ptolemy V (203-181 B.C.) and the Seleucid Antiochus IV made claims to divinity. In <a href='/NABRE/27/3/1'>DAN 3</a> and <a href='/NABRE/27/3/6'>6</a>, divinity is ascribed to Nebuchadnezzar and Darius, respectively."
NABRE,69,3,9,"[2] Dothan: a town in Ephraimite territory fourteen miles north of Shechem, mentioned elsewhere only twice (<a href='/NABRE/1/37/17'>GEN 37:17</a> and <a href='/NABRE/12/6/13'>2KG 6:13</a>), but five times in Judith (<a href='/NABRE/69/3/9'>3:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/4/6'>4:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/7/3'>7:3, 18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/8/3'>8:3</a>). Destroyed in 810 B.C. by Aramean invasions, Dothan was deserted until the Hellenistic period when a small settlement was constructed. Because it is mentioned so often, Dothan is sometimes thought to be the authors home."
NABRE,69,3,10,"[3] Geba: location uncertain. Scythopolis, the Greek name for ancient Beth-shean (<a href='/NABRE/6/17/11'>JOS 17:11</a>), the only city in Judith given its Greek name, strategically guarded the eastern end of the Valley of Jezreel."
NABRE,69,4,1,"[1] 4:1-7:32 In this section the focus narrows to Judea and specifically the little town of Bethulia. The scenes alternate between the Assyrian camp (<a href='/NABRE/69/5/1'>5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/69/6/13'>6:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/7/1'>7:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/7/6'>6-18</a>) and Judea/Bethulia (<a href='/NABRE/69/4/1'>4:1-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/6/14'>6:14-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/7/4'>7:4-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/7/19'>19-32</a>)."
NABRE,69,4,1,[2] 4:1-15 Here the scene shifts to Judea where Israel hears and is greatly terrified about Holofernes destruction of the neighboring places of worship. At Joakims instruction they take defensive measures and then pray fervently that God will not allow their sanctuary to be destroyed.
NABRE,69,4,1,"[3] Shrines: the Greek word hierais used only here and may mean holy places or things. By contrast, the sanctuary in Jerusalem is naos, ""temple"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/69/4/2'>2</a>); oikos, ""house"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/69/4/3'>3</a>); and hagia, lit., ""holy things"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/69/4/12'>12</a>)."
NABRE,69,4,3,[4] Returned from exile…purified from profanation: conflated historical references associated with events in 538 B.C. (return from exile) and 515 B.C. (dedication of the Second Temple) or perhaps even 164 B.C. (the rededication of the Second Temple in the Maccabean period).
NABRE,69,4,4,"[5] Of the eight cities listed, only the locations of Beth-horon, Jericho, and Samaria are known. Salem, mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/1/17/17'>GEN 17:17</a>, is thought to be an ancient name of Jerusalem."
NABRE,69,4,6,"[6] Joakim, who was high priest: see also vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/4/8'>8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/4/14'>14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/15/8'>15:8</a>. Joakim exercises religious and military authority comparable to that of Jonathan in Maccabean times (cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/10/18'>1MA 10:18-21</a>). Bethulia and Betomesthaim: unknown locations mentioned only in Judith. Bethulia may mean ""House of God"" (byt l/yh) or ""House of Ascent"" (byt lyh), perhaps a reference to either Bethel or Shechem."
NABRE,69,4,7,[7] Only wide enough for two at a time: such a narrow pass near Esdraelon cannot be identified.
NABRE,69,4,10,[8] Sackcloth: traditional sign of penitence and supplication is here taken to the extreme. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/32/3/8'>JON 3:8</a>.
NABRE,69,4,11,"[9] Fell prostrate in front of the temple: for a parallel to this ceremony of entreaty see <a href='/NABRE/29/1/13'>JOE 1:13, 14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/2/15'>2:15-17</a>."
NABRE,69,4,12,[10] The altar…draped in sackcloth: attested nowhere else in the Bible.
NABRE,69,4,13,"[11] The Lord heard their cry: this anticipates the role of Judith, the instrument of deliverance (chap. <a href='/NABRE/69/16/1'>16</a>), though the people believe God has abandoned them (<a href='/NABRE/69/7/25'>7:25</a>)."
NABRE,69,5,1,[1] 5:1-6:13 The scene shifts to the Assyrian camp below Bethulia where Holofernes talks with Achior and then expels him to the foot of the hill below the little town.
NABRE,69,5,5,"[2] 5:5-21 Achior (Heb. ""brother of light"") traces the covenant of Israel from Abraham to the exile and defends the inviolability of the people because their powerful God will defend them if they do not sin. He later identifies the head Judith displays as that of Holofernes (<a href='/NABRE/69/14/6'>14:6-10</a>). He may be modeled on the famous sage, Ahiqar (see note on <a href='/NABRE/68/1/21'>TOB 1:21</a>). Achior is wise, but the wisdom granted Judith by God is more effective than his."

The question, ""Who is God?"" motivates the entire narrative. Holofernes defends Nebuchadnezzar; Judith defends the Lord."
NABRE,69,6,13,[2] 6:14-21 The scene shifts back to Bethulia where Achior tells the town leaders and citizens all that Holofernes has planned against them. The people cry out to God for help.

NABRE,69,6,18,"[4] The people fell prostrate and worshiped God: here in response to Achiors report, the people properly turn to God in their distress. See <a href='/NABRE/69/4/12'>4:12</a>."
NABRE,69,7,1,[1] 7:1-5 The scene returns to the Assyrian camp (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/7/1'>1-3</a>) and then shifts back to Bethulia (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/7/4'>4-5</a>). Holofernes orders war preparations; Israel sees and is greatly terrified.
NABRE,69,7,5,"[2] 7:6-32 The scene is set first in the Assyrian camp where Holofernes moves against Bethulia (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/7/6'>6-18</a>), and then in Bethulia where the people cry out to God and, when their courage fails, determine it is time to surrender (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/7/19'>19-32</a>)."
NABRE,69,7,19,"[3] The prayers of the Israelites shift focus from concern for the Temple and Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/69/4/12'>4:12</a>), to concern that God see the arrogance of the enemy and show pity on the covenant people (<a href='/NABRE/69/6/18'>6:18</a>), to expression of fear and loss of courage regarding their own safety (<a href='/NABRE/69/7/19'>7:19</a>)."

NABRE,69,7,28,"[5] In keeping with the deuteronomic theme of retribution, the Bethulians interpret their persecution as punishment for their sins and the sins of their ancestors (see <a href='/NABRE/2/20/5'>EXO 20:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/7'>34:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/18/1'>EZE 18</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/69/8/18'>8:18-27</a>, Judith argues that they are being tested."
NABRE,69,8,1,[1] 8:1-10:10 In this section the hero is introduced (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/1'>8:1-8</a>) and prepares to deliver Israel (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/9'>8:9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/69/10/10'>10:10</a>).
NABRE,69,8,1,"[2] Judith has the longest genealogy accorded any biblical woman, with family ties back to Israel/Jacob."

However, she will give a part of her inheritance to her late husbands family before her death (<a href='/NABRE/69/16/24'>16:24</a>); she chooses not to remarry (<a href='/NABRE/69/16/22'>16:22</a>)."
NABRE,69,8,8,"[5] 8:9-10:10 This section opens with a repetition of the information that Judith heard about the discouragement of the people and about Uzziahs vow (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/69/8/1'>1</a>). Judiths plan to save Israel then takes shape. In her own home, she meets with the elders of Bethulia (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/8/9'>9-36</a>), prays (<a href='/NABRE/69/9/1'>9:1-14</a>), prepares herself and the food she will need in the Assyrian camp (<a href='/NABRE/69/10/1'>10:1-5</a>), goes out to meet the elders again at the gate of Bethulia (<a href='/NABRE/69/10/6'>10:6-8</a>), and sets out with her maid for the Assyrian camp (<a href='/NABRE/69/10/9'>10:9-10</a>)."
NABRE,69,8,10,"[6] Her maid who was in charge of all her things: cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/15/2'>GEN 15:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/24/2'>24:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/39/4'>39:4</a>.

Her last act in the story will be to give this woman her freedom (<a href='/NABRE/69/16/23'>16:23</a>)."
NABRE,69,8,12,[7] Judith reprimands the leaders for putting God to the test (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/6/16'>DEU 6:16</a>). She will argue that the right to test belongs to God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/8/25'>25-27</a>).
NABRE,69,8,15,"[8] 8:15-16 Gods plans are in opposition to Nebuchadnezzars plans (<a href='/NABRE/69/2/2'>2:2, 4</a>). To protect…or to destroy: Judith defends Gods freedom (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/1/21'>JOB 1:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/2/10'>2:10</a>)."
NABRE,69,8,24,"[9] Let us set an example: when Judith says ""us,"" she includes herself. She proposes that she together with Uzziah, Chabris, and Charmis model a faithful response to Gods test for the wavering people. ""Let us give thanks to the Lord our God for putting us to the test"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/69/8/25'>25</a>) repeats her intention. ""Us"" for Uzziah does not include her (see vv. <a href='/NABRE/69/8/30'>30</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/8/31'>31</a>)."
NABRE,69,8,30,[10] 8:30-31 An oath that we cannot break: Uzziahs request that Judith pray for rain underscores his lack of imagination concerning how Gods deliverance might come.
NABRE,69,9,1,"[1] 9:1-14 Judith prepares to confront the enemy by turning to God, the source of her strength. Her prayer, an individual lament, moves from a remembrance of Gods saving deeds of the past to an appeal to God to exercise the same power in the present. Judith contrasts the empty pride of the Assyrians with Gods surpassing might, powerful enough to be exercised in unlikely ways, even through the hand of a woman."
NABRE,69,9,2,"[2] The foreigners: Shechem, the Hivite, violated Dinah, Jacob and Leahs daughter (<a href='/NABRE/1/34/2'>GEN 34:2</a>). Defiled a virgin by violating her: meaning of the Greek is unclear; lit., ""who loosened the virgins womb (metran) to defilement."" Some read ""headdress"" or ""girdle"" (mitran) instead of ""womb"" (metran)."
NABRE,69,9,3,"[3] Because Shechem had deceived and violated Dinah, her brothers, Simeon and Levi, tricked Shechem and the men of his city into being circumcised, and then killed them while they were recovering from the circumcision (<a href='/NABRE/1/34/13'>GEN 34:13-29</a>)."

NABRE,69,9,9,"[5] 9:9-10 In a five-fold petition, Judith asks that God see their pride, send fury on their heads, give her a strong hand, strike down the enemy through her deceit, and crush their pride by the hand of a female (theleia, see also <a href='/NABRE/69/13/15'>13:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/16/5'>16:5</a>, rather than the more usual gyne, woman). In an androcentric society, there was no greater dishonor for a male than that he die at the hand of a female (see <a href='/NABRE/7/9/53'>JUG 9:53-54</a>). Nine verses emphasize that by her hand Gods deliverance is accomplished: <a href='/NABRE/69/8/33'>8:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/9/9'>9:9, 10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/12/4'>12:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/13/4'>13:4, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/69/13/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/15/10'>15:10</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/69/16/5'>16:5</a>."

NABRE,69,11,5,"[1] 11:5-6 Here the word ""lord"" has a double meaning, indicating both Holofernes and God. Much irony is evident in Judiths conversation with Holofernes (e.g., 12:4)."

NABRE,69,14,1,"[1] 14:1-16:25 This section describes Judiths plan to attack the Assyrian camp (<a href='/NABRE/69/14/1'>14:1-5</a>) and its execution (<a href='/NABRE/69/14/11'>14:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/69/15/7'>15:7</a>). Between the plan and its execution, Achior identifies the head of Holofernes and is converted to Judaism. The book concludes with the victory celebration (<a href='/NABRE/69/15/8'>15:8-14</a>), hymn of thanksgiving (<a href='/NABRE/69/16/1'>16:1-20</a>), and a description of Judiths final days (<a href='/NABRE/69/16/21'>16:21-25</a>). Elements from chaps. <a href='/NABRE/69/8/1'>8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/69/9/1'>9</a> recur here: Judith, widow of Manasseh (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/2'>8:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/16/22'>16:22</a>), lived alone in Bethulia on her estate (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/4'>8:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/16/22'>16:22</a>), with servants and property (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/7'>8:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/16/21'>16:21</a>). Judiths instructions begin with the words ""listen to me"" (<a href='/NABRE/69/8/11'>8:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/14/1'>14:1</a>). Her prayer for success (<a href='/NABRE/69/9/1'>9:1-14</a>) is balanced by a prayer and display of success in <a href='/NABRE/69/14/14'>14:14-16</a>."
NABRE,69,14,1,"[2] 14:1-5 Listen to me: an imperative (used also in <a href='/NABRE/69/8/11'>8:11, 32</a>) opens Judiths instruction that the people display the head of Holofernes on the parapet and themselves in ranks before the enemy at daybreak. The strategy is to throw the Assyrians into panic and strike them down in their confusion; cf. <a href='/NABRE/69/15/1'>15:1-3</a>."
NABRE,69,14,5,"[3] 14:6-10 Recognizing the head of Holofernes, Achior faints. Then he throws himself down before Judith, acclaiming her blessed in Judah and every nation. After listening to all she had done, Achior is circumcised and joins the house of Israel. Since this violates the prohibition of <a href='/NABRE/5/23/4'>DEU 23:4</a> that no Ammonite or Moabite shall enter the assembly, even to the tenth generation, some suggest that the book was not included in the Hebrew scriptures for this reason. However, see <a href='/NABRE/23/56/3'>ISA 56:3-6</a>."
NABRE,69,15,9,"[1] In the Lectionary of the Catholic Church, this passage is one of several choices for feasts of Mary (e.g., the Presentation of Mary). These words of praise are also echoed in antiphons for the Liturgy of the Hours on Marian feasts."
NABRE,69,15,11,[2] Thirty days: the central actions in each half of the book are accomplished in a total of thirty-four days. Bethulia was without water for thirty-four days (<a href='/NABRE/69/7/20'>7:20</a>). Judith spent four days in the enemy camp and the Israelites plunder the Assyrian camp for thirty days.
NABRE,69,15,14,[3] 15:14-16:17 Judiths hymn of deliverance is patterned on the Song of Miriam (<a href='/NABRE/2/15/20'>EXO 15:20-21</a>).
NABRE,69,16,23,[1] One hundred and five: long life was a sign of blessing (see <a href='/NABRE/18/42/16'>JOB 42:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/16/31'>PRO 16:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/20/29'>20:29</a>). The fact that the Maccabean period was one hundred and five years long (168-63 B.C.) may account for assigning this age to Judith.
NABRE,69,16,24,[2] Seven days: the customary period for mourning the dead (<a href='/NABRE/9/31/13'>1SM 31:13</a>).
NABRE,69,16,25,"[3] Spread terror: Judith is compared to the heroes of the Book of Judges (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/3/11'>JUG 3:11, 30</a>)."
NABRE,17,1,1,"[1] A:1 The genealogy of Mordecai is designed to reflect opposition to Israels enemy Haman, an Agagite (v. <a href='/NABRE/17/1/17'>17</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/9/15/1'>1SM 15:1-9</a>, Saul (whose fathers name was Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin) conquered Agag the Amalekite."
NABRE,17,1,2,"[2] A:2-3 Repeats information from <a href='/NABRE/17/2/5'>2:5-6</a>, on which see note, but states that Mordecai is already a court official. In the Hebrew text, Mordecai is not given this rank until <a href='/NABRE/17/7/10'>7:10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/17/8/2'>8:2</a>."
NABRE,17,1,4,[3] A:4 An interpretation of the dream that relates its features to the plot of the book is given in F:1-6.
NABRE,17,1,11,"[4] A:12-17 Retells the story in <a href='/NABRE/17/2/21'>2:21-23</a>, but with several differences. Addition A has Mordecai inform the king directly, whereas in <a href='/NABRE/17/2/22'>2:22</a> Mordecai informs the king through Esther after she has become queen. A:16 has Mordecai rewarded immediately after his service, whereas the Hebrew text defers the reward of Mordecai to <a href='/NABRE/17/6/3'>6:3-13</a>. In A:17, the failure of the eunuchs plot becomes Hamans reason for seeking the destruction of Mordecai and his people, something which the Hebrew text attributes to Mordecais refusal to bow to Haman (see note on <a href='/NABRE/17/3/2'>3:2</a>)."
NABRE,17,1,17,"[5] A:17 A Bougean: the origin of this term is unknown; it may represent a garbled attempt to render the Hebrew ""Agagite"" (<a href='/NABRE/17/3/1'>3:1</a>). In the Greek additions Haman not only knows the plot to assassinate the king, but is apparently a co-conspirator."
NABRE,17,2,1,"[1] The Hebrew text opens with a portrait of the power and luxury of the Persian king Ahasuerus (Xerxes I, whose empire consisted of only about thirty provinces)."
NABRE,17,2,2,"[2] Susa was the winter capital of the Persian empire. The ""royal precinct"" (sometimes translated ""stronghold"" or ""citadel"") was a well-fortified section of the city that included the kings residence. The Book of Esther depicts other citizens living in this section as well."
NABRE,17,2,19,"[3] An irrevocable royal decree: the first of several in the book. In a satiric portrayal, even a minor domestic disagreement is resolved through a sweeping international edict. The irrevocable nature of the decree is intended to increase its force, but creates problems if the king needs to adapt to new information or conditions. See note on <a href='/NABRE/17/8/8'>8:8</a>."
NABRE,17,3,5,"[1] Mordecai: a Babylonian name, deriving from the god Marduk. Like Esther, Mordecai may have had a Jewish name as well, although in his case we do not know what it is. The chronology of the book makes him well over one hundred years old, since he was deported with Jehoiachin about 598 B.C.; cf. A:1."
NABRE,17,3,7,"[2] Esther: a Babylonian name, deriving from the goddess Ishtar. She is given a Hebrew name as well, ""Hadassah,"" which means ""myrtle."""
NABRE,17,3,18,"[3] 2:19-23 This story is retold and placed at the beginning of the book in Greek addition A:12-17, with significant differences (see note). The Greek also has a translation of the account in <a href='/NABRE/17/2/19'>2:19-23</a> at this point in the narrative."
NABRE,17,3,23,"[4] Impaled on stakes: a method of execution used by the Persians, known from ancient records and reliefs."
NABRE,17,4,2,[1] We are not told the reasons for Mordecais refusal to bow. It may be the result of a form of Jewish piety that refuses to offer such homage to any mortal; see also Greek addition C:5-7.
NABRE,17,4,7,"[2] The pur, or lot: the Hebrew text preserves the Akkadian word purbecause its plural, purim, became the name of the feast of Purim commemorating the deliverance of the Jews; cf. <a href='/NABRE/17/9/24'>9:24, 26</a>. The lot functions as a kind of horoscope to determine the most favorable day for the pogrom."
NABRE,17,4,10,"[3] Signet ring: a ring containing a seal that was impressed on documents to authenticate them. With this ring, Haman can issue decrees in the kings name."
NABRE,17,4,11,"[4] Although Ahasuerus seems to refuse the bribe, this is probably a polite way of accepting it that makes him appear munificent (compare <a href='/NABRE/1/23/11'>GEN 23:11-15</a>, where Ephron tells Abraham that he ""gives"" him the field and, after a few more pleasantries, sets a very high price for it). Both <a href='/NABRE/17/4/7'>4:7</a> and <a href='/NABRE/17/7/4'>7:4</a> seem to assume Ahasuerus has accepted the money."
NABRE,17,5,6,"[1] B:6 Fourteenth day: only the Greek text here names the fourteenth of Adar as the day set aside for the destruction of the Jews. The Hebrew text consistently gives the date as the thirteenth of Adar (e.g., 3:13) as does Greek addition E:20; see note on <a href='/NABRE/17/9/17'>9:17-19</a>."
NABRE,17,7,8,"[1] The Greek text adds the following to Mordecais message to Esther: ""Remember the days of your lowly estate, when you were brought up in my charge; for Haman, who is second to the king, has asked for our death. Invoke the Lord and speak to the king for us: save us from death."""
NABRE,17,7,14,[2] From another source: probably Mordecai refers to divine aid; the Greek additions (C) are explicit about this.
NABRE,17,8,28,[1] C:28 Wine of libations: offered in sacrifice to the gods.
NABRE,17,9,1,[1] D:1-16 Addition D expands on and replaces <a href='/NABRE/17/5/1'>5:1-2</a> of the Hebrew text.
NABRE,17,9,9,"[2] D:9 Brother: along with ""sister,"" a common term of affection between lovers or husband and wife. See, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/22/4/9'>SON 4:9-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/8/1'>8:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/5/22'>TOB 5:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/7/11'>7:11</a>."
NABRE,17,10,1,[1] 5:1-2 The Hebrew text translated here is a short form of the account which is in Greek addition D.
NABRE,17,11,4,[1] 6:4-13 Hamans presumption that the king wants to honor him creates the irony that Haman himself prescribes and fulfills the elaborate terms of Mordecais reward. This comic reversal mirrors the fatal reversal to come: Haman and those who hate the Jews find that their plot to destroy them recoils on their own head.
NABRE,17,13,8,"[1] A decree written…cannot be revoked: the king cannot directly grant Esthers request (v. <a href='/NABRE/17/13/5'>5</a>) to revoke the previous decree against the Jews because of the irrevocable character of the laws of the Medes and Persians (see <a href='/NABRE/17/1/19'>1:19</a> and note). He can, however, empower Esther to issue another decree in his name to counteract the earlier one. The second decree authorizes the Jews to defend themselves against those who would kill them, which is what they do in <a href='/NABRE/17/9/2'>9:2</a>. This is why the outcome of the two decrees is that the attackers are killed instead of the Jews, rather than a simple cancellation of all hostilities."
NABRE,17,14,10,"[1] E:10 Macedonian: throughout the book Haman is identified with terms of contempt—in the Hebrew text as an Agagite (<a href='/NABRE/17/3/1'>3:1, 10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/17/8/3'>8:3, 5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/17/9/24'>9:24</a>; cf. note on A:17), thus making him a descendant of Agag, king of the Amalekites, a group hated by the Israelites; in the Greek additions Haman is identified as a Macedonian, reflecting the enmity between the Persians and the Macedonians after Macedonias conquest of Persia in the fourth century B.C."
NABRE,17,16,17,"[1] 9:17-19 According to Esther, Jewish feasting on the day after the defeat of their enemies establishes the date of the holiday. Since in Susa the fighting lasts for two days, the Jews of that community initially celebrate Purim a day later than Jews elsewhere."
NABRE,17,16,21,[2] Mordecai creates a compromise among the Jews by making Purim a two-day festival.
NABRE,17,16,23,"[3] According to the story, the two-day celebration has its roots in popular observance, which Mordecais leadership reinforces and regularizes."
NABRE,17,16,28,"[4] 9:29-32 In attempting to give the impression of concerted action between Esther and Mordecai, the Hebrew text here presents several unresolved difficulties. Verse 29 makes Mordecai and Esther joint authors of a letter that is ascribed in v. <a href='/NABRE/17/16/32'>32</a> to Esther alone. Verse 31 makes Mordecai and Esther joint authors of a letter that is ascribed in vv. <a href='/NABRE/17/16/20'>20-22</a> to Mordecai alone. Finally, it is difficult to see the purpose of confirming a second letter in the second letter itself."
NABRE,17,18,7,"[1] F:7 Two lots: this passage of the Greek text gives an additional interpretation of the feast. The two lots are drawn by God to determine, respectively, the destiny of Israel and that of the nations; contrast with <a href='/NABRE/17/3/7'>3:7</a> of the Hebrew text."
NABRE,17,18,10,"[2] F:11 Several ""Ptolemies"" (Greek kings reigning in Egypt) had wives named Cleopatra. This postscript dates the Greek version somewhere between 116 B.C. and 48 B.C."
NABRE,74,1,1,"[1] Land of Kittim: Greece. The name referred originally to inhabitants of Kiti, capital of the isle of Cyprus, then to any Cypriots (<a href='/NABRE/23/23/1'>ISA 23:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/2/10'>JER 2:10</a>), later to Greeks in general, and finally even to Romans.

NABRE,74,1,10,"[4] The one hundred and thirty-seventh year: Antiochus IV seized the throne in September, 175 B.C. Dates are given in this book according to the beginning of the Seleucid era, which however was reckoned in two different ways. Antiochians considered this date to be October, 312 B.C. (Syrian calendar), while Babylonians and Jewish priests accepted April, 311 B.C. as the commencement of the era (Temple calendar). The author of 1 Maccabees dates political events by the Syrian calendar but religious events by the Temple calendar. Accordingly, the civil New Year occurred variously in September or October, the religious New Year in March or April."
NABRE,74,1,14,"[5] Gymnasium: symbol and center of Greek athletic and intellectual life, it was the chief instrument of Hellenistic culture. Jewish youth were attracted by sports and encouraged to join youth clubs. They received training in military skills and in the duties of citizens. Many were won over to paganism, and some even sought surgical correction of their circumcision (since physical exercise was carried out in nudity)."

It corresponds to <a href='/NABRE/75/12/17'>2MA 12:17-23</a>. The action was probably a reprisal for the massacre referred to in <a href='/NABRE/74/5/13'>1MA 5:13</a>.

NABRE,74,8,1,"[1] This chapter contains the account of the embassy which Judas sent to Rome, probably before the death of Nicanor, to conclude a treaty of alliance between Rome and the Jewish nation. Without precise chronology, the pertinent data are gathered into a unified theme. The image of the Roman Republic greatly impressed the smaller Eastern peoples seeking support against their overlords (vv. <a href='/NABRE/74/8/1'>1-16</a>), because of Roman success in war (vv. <a href='/NABRE/74/8/2'>2-11</a>) and effective aid to their allies (vv. <a href='/NABRE/74/8/12'>12-13</a>). Numerous interventions by Rome in the politics of the Near East bear witness to its power and prestige in the second century B.C.

With the increased Roman control of Palestine after 63 B.C., the Republic and later the Empire became heartily detested. The eulogy of Rome in this chapter is one of the reasons why 1 Maccabees was not preserved by the Palestinian Jews of the century that followed."
NABRE,74,8,2,"[2] Gauls: probably the Celts of northern Italy and southern France, subdued by the Romans in 222 B.C., and again in 200-191 B.C.; but also those in Asia Minor (the Galatians), whom the Romans defeated in 189 B.C."
NABRE,74,8,5,"[3] Philip: Philip V of Macedonia, defeated by a Graeco-Roman alliance at Cynoscephalae in 197 B.C. Perseus, his son, was defeated at Pydna in 168 B.C., and died a prisoner. With this, the kingdom of Macedonia came to an end."
NABRE,74,8,6,"[4] Antiochus: Antiochus III, greatest of the Seleucid kings. He was defeated at Magnesia in 190 B.C. By the Treaty of Apamea in 189 B.C., he was obliged to pay Rome a crushing indemnity of 15,000 talents. The weakening of Antiochene power and the growing military and economic influence of Rome may have led Antiochus IV to adopt the policy of political, religious, and cultural unification of Syria and Palestine."
NABRE,74,8,8,"[5] Lycia, Mysia, and Lydia: regions in western Asia Minor. ""Lycia"" and ""Mysia"" are restored here by conjectural emendation; the Greek text has ""India, Media,"" most likely through scribal error.

NABRE,74,8,9,"[6] 8:9-10 The revolt of the Achaean League, inserted here, occurred in 146 B.C., after Judas time. It was crushed by the Roman consul Lucius Mummius and marked the end of Greek independence."

NABRE,74,9,2,"[1] They took the road…Arbela, they captured it: this passage is restored, in part, by conjectural emendation. The present Greek text could be translated, ""They took the road to Gilgal, and camping opposite Mesaloth at Arbela, they captured it."" But Arbela (modern Khirbet Irbid) was in Galilee, on a high hill overlooking the western shore of the Sea of Galilee. Gilgal, on the contrary, was in the Jordan valley near Jericho. ""Mesaloth"" is probably a corrupt form of a Hebrew word meaning ""steps, ascent."" It is possible, however, that all these terms referred to places in the Judean hills."
NABRE,74,9,3,"[2] The first month of the one hundred and fifty-second year: April/May 160 B.C., by the Temple calendar."
NABRE,74,9,15,"[3] As far as the mountain slopes: conjectural emendation. The Greek text has ""as far as Mount Azotus""; this is most unlikely. Apparently the Greek translator mistook the Hebrew word ashdot, ""slopes,"" for ashdod, ""Azotus."""

NABRE,75,9,1,"[1] 9:1-29 In order to keep together the various accounts of Gods punishment of the persecutors of his people, the author places here the stories of Antiochus illness and death (in actuality the king died about the same time as the purification of the Temple, i.e., 164 B.C.; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/4/36'>1MA 4:36-59</a>; <a href='/NABRE/74/6/1'>6:1-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/10/1'>2MA 10:1-8</a>); of Judas campaigns in Idumea and Transjordan; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/5/1'>1MA 5:1-51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/10/14'>2MA 10:14-38</a>; and of the first expedition of Lysias (<a href='/NABRE/74/4/26'>1MA 4:26-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/11/1'>2MA 11:1-15</a>)."
NABRE,75,9,19,"[2] 9:19-27 Despite the statement in v. <a href='/NABRE/75/9/18'>18</a> this letter is not really a supplication. It is rather a notification to all the kings subjects of the appointment of his son as his successor and a request that they be loyal to the new king. Apparently the same letter, which has every appearance of being authentic, was sent to the various peoples throughout the kingdom, with only a few words of address changed for each group."
NABRE,75,9,29,"[3] Foster brother: an honorary title conferred by the king on prominent courtiers, whether or not they had been raised with him. Philip tried to seize control of Antioch from the young Antiochus V (<a href='/NABRE/74/6/55'>1MA 6:55-56</a>, <a href='/NABRE/74/6/63'>63</a>) and fled to Egypt when he failed."
NABRE,75,10,3,[1] Two years: three years according to <a href='/NABRE/74/1/54'>1MA 1:54</a>; <a href='/NABRE/74/4/52'>4:52</a>.
NABRE,75,10,7,[2] Rods entwined with leaves: the wreathed wands (thyrsoi) carried in processions honoring Dionysus (<a href='/NABRE/75/6/7'>6:7</a>) were apparently not regarded as distinctively pagan.
NABRE,75,10,12,"[3] Ptolemy, called Macron: son of Dorymenes (<a href='/NABRE/75/4/45'>4:45</a>); he supported Antiochus IV in 168 B.C. during his invasion of Cyprus."
NABRE,75,10,13,[4] 10:14-23 Probably the same campaign of Judas against the Idumeans that is mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/74/5/1'>1MA 5:1-3</a>.
NABRE,75,10,24,"[5] Timothy, who had previously been defeated by the Jews: as recounted in <a href='/NABRE/75/8/30'>8:30-33</a>."
NABRE,75,10,28,[6] As soon as dawn broke: the same battle at dawn as in <a href='/NABRE/74/5/30'>1MA 5:30-34</a>.
NABRE,75,10,37,"[7] Timothy…they killed: apparently Timothy is still alive in <a href='/NABRE/75/12/2'>12:2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/75/12/18'>18-25</a>. Perhaps there was more than one Timothy. Or the present passage is not in chronological order. Gazara, v. <a href='/NABRE/75/10/32'>32</a> (Gezer), was not captured by the Jews until much later (cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/9/50'>1MA 9:50-52</a>; <a href='/NABRE/74/13/53'>13:53</a>). See <a href='/NABRE/74/5/8'>1MA 5:8</a> for the capture of Jazer."
NABRE,75,11,1,[1] 11:1-12 The defeat of Lysias at Beth-zur probably occurred before the purification of the Temple; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/4/26'>1MA 4:26-35</a>.
NABRE,75,11,5,[2] Five stadia: one stadium is equal to about six hundred six feet. The actual distance to Beth-zur is about twenty miles.
NABRE,75,11,21,[3] The one hundred and forty-eighth year: 164 B.C. The reading of the name of the month and its position in the calendar are uncertain. The most likely chronological sequence of the four letters is vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/11/16'>16-21</a>; vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/11/34'>34-38</a>; vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/11/27'>27-33</a>; vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/11/22'>22-26</a>.
NABRE,75,11,33,"[4] The date, which is the same as the date of the Romans letter (v. <a href='/NABRE/75/11/38'>38</a>), cannot be correct. The kings letter must be connected with the peace treaty of the one hundred forty-ninth year of the Seleucid era, i.e., 163 B.C. Perhaps the mention of the month of Xanthicus in the body of the letter (v. <a href='/NABRE/75/11/30'>30</a>) caused the date of the Romans letter to be transferred to this one."
NABRE,75,11,38,"[5] The date is March 12, 164 B.C."
NABRE,75,12,2,"[1] Apollonius, son of Gennaeus: not the Apollonius who was the son of Menestheus (<a href='/NABRE/75/4/21'>4:21</a>). Nicanor: probably distinct from the Nicanor of <a href='/NABRE/75/14/2'>14:2</a>."
NABRE,75,12,10,"[2] From there: not from Jamnia (vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/12/8'>8-9</a>) or Joppa (vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/12/3'>3-7</a>), but from a place in Transjordan; vv. <a href='/NABRE/75/12/10'>10-26</a> parallel the account given in <a href='/NABRE/74/5/9'>1MA 5:9-13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/74/5/24'>24-54</a> of Judas campaign in northern Transjordan."
NABRE,75,12,17,"[3] Certain Jews known as Toubians: because they lived ""in the land of Tob"" (<a href='/NABRE/74/5/13'>1MA 5:13</a>)."
NABRE,75,12,26,"[4] Atargatis: a Syrian goddess, represented by the body of a fish, who in Hellenistic times was identified with Astarte and Artemis."
NABRE,75,12,29,[5] Scythopolis: the Greek name of the city of Beth-shan; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/5/52'>1MA 5:52</a>.
NABRE,75,12,35,"[6] One of Bacenors men: certain ancient witnesses to the text have ""one of the Toubians""; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/75/12/17'>17</a>."
NABRE,75,12,42,"[7] 12:42-45 This is the earliest statement of the doctrine that prayers (v. <a href='/NABRE/75/12/42'>42</a>) and sacrifices (v. <a href='/NABRE/75/12/43'>43</a>) for the dead are efficacious. Judas probably intended his purification offering to ward off punishment from the living. The author, however, uses the story to demonstrate belief in the resurrection of the just (<a href='/NABRE/75/7/9'>7:9, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/75/7/23'>23</a>, <a href='/NABRE/75/7/36'>36</a>), and in the possibility of expiation for the sins of otherwise good people who have died. This belief is similar to, but not quite the same as, the Catholic doctrine of purgatory."
NABRE,75,13,1,[1] In the one hundred and forty-ninth year: 163/162 B.C.
NABRE,75,13,2,"[2] They led: the Greek means literally ""each (of them) led,"" but it is unlikely that the author meant the already immense numbers to be doubled; the numbers are similar to those in <a href='/NABRE/74/6/30'>1MA 6:30</a>."
NABRE,75,13,4,[3] Beroea: the Greek name of Aleppo in Syria.
NABRE,75,13,5,[4] Ashes: probably smoldering ashes; the tower resembles the ancient Persian fire towers.
NABRE,75,13,16,[5] They withdrew in triumph: according to <a href='/NABRE/74/6/47'>1MA 6:47</a> they fled.
NABRE,75,13,21,[6] Military secrets: probably about the lack of provisions in the besieged city; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/6/49'>1MA 6:49</a>.
NABRE,75,13,24,"[7] Gerrhenes: probably the inhabitants of Gerar, southeast of Gaza."
NABRE,75,14,1,"[1] Three years later: actually, Demetrius (I Soter), son of Seleucus (IV), landed at Tripolis in the year 151 of the Seleucid era (<a href='/NABRE/74/14/4'>1MA 14:4</a>), i.e., 162/161 B.C.; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/7/1'>1MA 7:1-7</a>."
NABRE,75,14,3,"[2] Alcimus, a former high priest: he was apparently appointed high priest by Antiochus V after Menelaus was executed, and then deposed for collaborating with the Seleucids."
NABRE,75,14,6,"[3] Hasideans, led by Judas Maccabeus: according to <a href='/NABRE/74/2/42'>1MA 2:42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/74/7/12'>7:12-17</a>, the Hasideans were a party separate from the Maccabees."
NABRE,75,14,24,"[4] Affection: compare <a href='/NABRE/74/7/26'>1MA 7:26-32</a>, where there is no hint of this cordial relationship between Nicanor and Judas."
NABRE,75,14,36,"[5] 14:37-46 The story of Razis belongs to the ""martyrology"" class of literature; it is similar to the stories in <a href='/NABRE/75/6/18'>6:18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/75/7/42'>7:42</a>."
NABRE,75,14,42,"[6] Die nobly: Raziss willingness to die nobly rather than to fall into enemy hands had a precedent in Saul (<a href='/NABRE/9/31/4'>1SM 31:4</a>). Razis took his life because he was convinced that God would restore his body in the resurrection of the dead (see <a href='/NABRE/75/7/11'>7:11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/75/7/22'>22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/14/46'>14:46</a>)."
NABRE,75,15,6,[1] Public victory monument: a heap of stones covered with the arms and armor of the fallen enemy.
NABRE,75,15,9,"[2] The law and the prophets: the first of the three parts of the Hebrew Scriptures, called the sacred books (<a href='/NABRE/74/12/9'>1MA 12:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/2/14'>2MA 2:14</a>)."
NABRE,75,15,12,"[3] Onias, the former high priest: Onias III (<a href='/NABRE/75/3/1'>3:1-40</a>). Evidently the author believed that departed just persons were in some way alive even before their resurrection."
NABRE,75,15,14,[4] A man: regarded by the postexilic Jews as one of the greatest figures in their history; cf. <a href='/NABRE/75/2/1'>2:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/16/14'>MAT 16:14</a>. Who…prays for the people: Jeremiahs prayer in heaven has been taken in the Roman Catholic tradition as a biblical witness to the intercession of the saints.
NABRE,75,15,31,"[5] Those in the citadel: presumably Jewish soldiers; actually, the citadel was still in the possession of the Syrians (<a href='/NABRE/74/13/50'>1MA 13:50</a>)."
NABRE,75,15,36,"[6] Mordecais Day: the feast of Purim, celebrated on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar (<a href='/NABRE/17/3/7'>EST 3:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/17/9/20'>9:20-23</a>; F:10)."
NABRE,18,1,1,"[1] Uz: somewhere in Edom or Arabia; see <a href='/NABRE/25/4/21'>LAM 4:21</a>. Job: the name probably means ""Where is the (divine) father?"" In Hebrew it is almost a homonym with the word for ""enemy"" (see note on <a href='/NABRE/18/13/24'>13:24</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/33/10'>33:10</a>)."
NABRE,18,1,3,"[2] The East: that is, east of Palestine."
NABRE,18,1,5,"[3] Cursed: lit., ""blessed."" So also in v. <a href='/NABRE/18/1/11'>11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/2/5'>2:5, 9</a>."
NABRE,18,1,6,"[4] Sons of God: members of the divine council; see <a href='/NABRE/1/6/1'>GEN 6:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/32/8'>DEU 32:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/82/1'>PS 82:1</a>. The satan: lit., ""adversary"" (as in <a href='/NABRE/11/11/14'>1KG 11:14</a>). Here a member of the heavenly court, ""the accuser"" (<a href='/NABRE/38/3/1'>ZEC 3:1</a>). In later biblical traditions this character will be developed as the devil (Gk. diabolos, ""adversary"")."
NABRE,18,1,15,[5] Sabeans: from southern Arabia.
NABRE,18,1,17,"[6] Chaldeans: from southern Mesopotamia; in the mid-first millennium B.C., synonymous with ""Babylonians."""
NABRE,18,1,21,[7] Go back there: to the earth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/7'>GEN 2:7</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/71/40/1'>SIR 40:1</a>.
NABRE,18,2,4,[1] Skin for skin: a proverbial expression derived perhaps from bartering; the precise meaning is unclear.
NABRE,18,2,9,[2] Curse God and die: the presupposition is that such blasphemy would be met with immediate death.
NABRE,18,2,11,[3] Teman: in Edom (see <a href='/NABRE/1/36/9'>GEN 36:9-11</a>). The Temanites (<a href='/NABRE/24/49/7'>JER 49:7</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/8'>OBA 1:8</a>) enjoyed a reputation for wisdom. Shuhand Naamath: locations unknown.
NABRE,18,3,1,"[1] His day: that is, the day of his birth."
NABRE,18,3,4,"[2] God: in Heb. Eloah, another name for the divinity, used frequently in Job."
NABRE,18,3,5,"[3] Blackness of day: that is, an eclipse."
NABRE,18,3,8,"[4] Leviathan: a mythological sea monster symbolizing primeval chaos. It is parallel to Sea, which was the opponent of Baal in the Ugaritic legends. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/9/13'>9:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/26/13'>26:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/40/25'>40:25-41</a>:26; <a href='/NABRE/19/74/13'>PS 74:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/104/26'>104:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/27/1'>ISA 27:1</a>."
NABRE,18,3,17,[5] There: in death.
NABRE,18,3,23,[6] Hemmed in: contrast the same verb as used in <a href='/NABRE/18/1/10'>1:10</a>.
NABRE,18,4,10,"[1] The lion: used figuratively here for the violent, rapacious sinner who cannot prevail against God."
NABRE,18,4,12,"[2] 4:12-21 A dramatic presentation of the idea of human nothingness in contrast to Gods greatness (v. <a href='/NABRE/18/4/17'>17</a>). The message of the ""private revelation"" that stirs Eliphaz so deeply is in reality expressed countless times in the Bible. The statements of the friends are often ""truths"" that are insensitive or irrelevant to Jobs questioning."
NABRE,18,5,1,[1] Holy ones: members of the heavenly court; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/1/6'>1:6</a> and note. They were viewed as heavenly intercessors.
NABRE,18,5,4,"[2] At the gate: of the city, where justice was administered."
NABRE,18,5,7,"[3] Sparks: in Hebrew, ""sons of resheph,"" which the ancient versions took as the name of a bird. Resheph was an underworld deity of plague, but the word also means ""flames"" in <a href='/NABRE/22/8/6'>SON 8:6</a>."
NABRE,18,5,9,[4] Perhaps to be omitted here; it is a duplicate of <a href='/NABRE/18/9/10'>9:10</a>.
NABRE,18,5,15,[5] From the sword of their mouth: the Hebrew is obscure.
NABRE,18,5,17,[6] Almighty: standard translation of Heb. Shaddai.
NABRE,18,5,19,[7] Six…the seventh: proverbial expression for any large number; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/16'>PRO 24:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/17/4'>LUK 17:4</a>.
NABRE,18,6,5,"[1] 6:5-6 Job would not complain if his life were as pleasant to him as fodder to a hungry animal; but his life is as disagreeable as insipid food. White of an egg: thus the obscure Hebrew has been understood in Jewish tradition; some render it ""mallow juice."""
NABRE,18,6,19,[2] Tema: in northwest Arabia. Sheba: home of the Sabeans; see note on <a href='/NABRE/18/1/15'>1:15</a>.
NABRE,18,6,21,"[3] It is only at this point that the previous lines (vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/6/1'>1-20</a>) are clearly directed to the three friends. The style of replying in these chapters (3-31) is often indirect. Job and the friends become mouthpieces through which the author presents current views on divine retribution in dramatic fashion. In chap. <a href='/NABRE/18/7/1'>7</a>, Job will not even speak directly to the friends."
NABRE,18,7,1,[1] Drudgery: taken by some to refer to military service; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/18/14/14'>14:14</a>.
NABRE,18,7,12,"[2] 7:12-21 Job now speaks not to his friends (who never speak to God), but to God. He does this frequently; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/9/28'>9:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/10/2'>10:2-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/13/20'>13:20-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/14/13'>14:13-22</a>."
NABRE,18,7,12,[3] An allusion to the personification of primeval chaos as a monstrous ocean vanquished by God; see note on <a href='/NABRE/18/3/8'>3:8</a>.
NABRE,18,7,15,"[4] Existence: lit., bones; the Hebrew is unclear."
NABRE,18,7,17,[5] 7:17-18 An ironic allusion to <a href='/NABRE/19/8/5'>PS 8:5</a>.
NABRE,18,8,11,"[1] 8:11-13 As marsh plants need water, so human beings need God. These verses may be a quotation from the teaching of the ancestors; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/18/8/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,18,9,3,"[1] Job begins to explore the possibility of challenging God in a lawsuit, a theme that will recur (<a href='/NABRE/18/10/2'>10:2</a>), but he knows the odds are against him (vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/9/12'>12-20</a>)."
NABRE,18,9,13,[2] Rahab: another name for the primeval sea-monster; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/18/3/8'>3:8</a> and <a href='/NABRE/19/89/11'>PS 89:11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/7/12'>JOB 7:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/26/12'>26:12</a>.
NABRE,18,9,28,[3] 9:28-31 You: refers to God.
NABRE,18,9,36,[4] I loathe my life: these words complete the thought of <a href='/NABRE/18/9/35'>9:35</a>.
NABRE,18,10,3,"[1] 10:3-12 These lines are a delicate mixture of sarcasm and prayer; Job ""reminds"" God, challenging the divine providence. Note the piteous tone of the final request in vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/10/20'>20-22</a>."
NABRE,18,10,17,"[2] Attack: or ""witnesses,"" continuing the metaphor of lawsuit used in these chapters."
NABRE,18,11,5,"[1] This is another of many ironies (e.g., cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/11/16'>11:16-19</a>) that occur throughout the book. Zophar does not know that God will speak (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/18/38/1'>38</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/42/1'>42</a>), but contrary to what he thinks."
NABRE,18,11,12,"[2] A colt…is born human: the Hebrew is obscure. As translated, it seems to be a proverb referring to an impossible event."
NABRE,18,12,1,"[1] Job begins his third and longest speech to the friends with sarcasm, and eventually he accuses them of falsehood (<a href='/NABRE/18/13/4'>13:4-11</a>). The dialogue between them becomes increasingly sharp. With the appeal to learning from beasts and birds (<a href='/NABRE/18/12/7'>12:7</a>), Job launches into what seems to be a bitter parody of the power of God."
NABRE,18,12,4,"[2] 12:4-5 The Hebrew is somewhat obscure, but the general sense is that the wicked mock the pious when the latter appear to be abandoned by God; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/22/7'>PS 22:7-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/27/39'>MAT 27:39-43</a>."
NABRE,18,12,6,"[3] Whom God has in his power: the Hebrew is obscure. The line may be a scribal error; some of the phrases occur in vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/12/9'>9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/18/12/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,18,12,18,"[4] He reduces kings to the condition of slaves, who wear only a cloth wrapped about the waist."
NABRE,18,13,14,[1] The second half of the verse is a common biblical expression for risking ones life; cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/12/3'>JUG 12:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/19/5'>1SM 19:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/28/21'>28:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/119/109'>PS 119:109</a>; the first half of the verse must have a similar meaning. Job is so confident of his innocence that he is willing to risk his life by going to judgment with God.
NABRE,18,13,15,"[2] Many translations adopt the Ketib reading, ""I have no hope."""
NABRE,18,13,20,"[3] In <a href='/NABRE/18/13/20'>13:20</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/14/22'>14:22</a>, Job directs his address to God; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/7/8'>7:8-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/9/28'>9:28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/10/22'>10:22</a>. His three friends never do this."
NABRE,18,13,24,"[4] The Hebrew word for ""enemy"" (oyeb) is very close to the Hebrew form of Jobs name (iyyob). The play on the word implies that God has confused the two."
NABRE,18,14,1,"[1] The sorrowful lament of Job is that God should relent in view of the limited life of human beings. When compared to plant life, which dies but can revive, the death of human beings is final. Jobs wild and ""unthinkable"" wish in vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/14/13'>13-17</a> is a bold stroke of imagination and desire: if only in Sheol he were protected till God would remember him! Were he to live again (v. <a href='/NABRE/18/14/14'>14</a>), things would be different, but alas, God destroys ""the hope of mortals"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/18/14/19'>19</a>)."
NABRE,18,14,17,[2] Sealed up in a pouch: hidden away and forgotten.
NABRE,18,15,1,"[1] The tone of Eliphazs speech is now much rougher. In vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/15/7'>7-9</a> he ridicules Jobs knowledge with a sarcastic question about whether he was a member of the divine council before creation and thus had unique wisdom (according to <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>PRO 8:22-31</a>, only Woman Wisdom existed before creation). Verses 20-35 are a typical description of the fate of the wicked."
NABRE,18,15,31,[2] The translation is uncertain.
NABRE,18,15,35,[3] The plans of the wicked yield nothing but futile results. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/7/15'>PS 7:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/59/4'>ISA 59:4</a>.
NABRE,18,16,8,[1] You: God. Job then describes in vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/16/9'>9-17</a> the savage treatment that he has received from God.
NABRE,18,16,18,"[2] As the exposed blood of those who were unjustly slain cries to heaven for vengeance (<a href='/NABRE/1/4/10'>GEN 4:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/24/6'>EZE 24:6-9</a>), so Jobs sufferings demand redress."
NABRE,18,16,19,"[3] Witness: refers perhaps to God (is Job appealing to God against God?), or to a mediator (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/9/33'>9:33</a>), or to a personification of Jobs prayer."
NABRE,18,17,3,[1] Addressed to God; v. <a href='/NABRE/18/17/10'>10</a> to Jobs friends.
NABRE,18,17,13,"[2] 17:13-16 Job elaborates another of the vivid descriptions of ""life"" in Sheol; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/3/13'>3:13-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/10/21'>10:21-22</a>."

NABRE,18,18,14,"[2] The king of terrors: of Sheol, of Death (cf. the ""terrors"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/18/18/11'>11</a>). However, the Hebrew of this verse is obscure."
NABRE,18,19,1,"[1] Job continues railing against his friends (vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/19/2'>2-5</a>), and describing Gods savage attack in words reminiscent of <a href='/NABRE/18/16/9'>16:9-17</a>."
NABRE,18,19,20,"[2] Skin of my teeth: although the metaphor is not clear, this has become a proverbial expression for a narrow escape. It does not fit Jobs situation here."
NABRE,18,19,23,[3] 19:23-24 What Job is about to say is so important that he wants it recorded in a permanent manner.
NABRE,18,19,25,"[4] 19:25-27 The meaning of this passage is obscure because the original text has been poorly preserved and the ancient versions do not agree among themselves. Job asserts three times that he shall see a future vindicator (Hebrew goel), but he leaves the time and manner of this vindication undefined. The Vulgate translation has Job indicating a belief in resurrection after death, but the Hebrew and the other ancient versions are less specific."
NABRE,18,20,17,"[1] Oil: olive oil, one of the main agricultural products of ancient Palestine, a land proverbially rich in honey and milk; see <a href='/NABRE/2/3/8'>EXO 3:8</a>; etc."
NABRE,18,20,29,[2] Zophar ends his lecture in the style of Bildad (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/18/19'>18:19</a>) with a summary appraisal of what he has been saying about the fate of the wicked.
NABRE,18,21,7,"[1] In vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/21/7'>7-29</a> Job launches into a realistic description of the fate of the wicked, contrary to the claims made by the friends."
NABRE,18,21,22,[2] Those on high: the heavenly beings; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/1/6'>1:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/82/1'>PS 82:1-8</a>.

This may be interpreted as a sign that the three friends see no point in further dialogue, or that Jobs replies have reduced them to silence, or that there has been a mistake in the transmission of the text (hence various transferrals of verses have been proposed to include Zophar, but without any textual evidence)."
NABRE,18,22,3,"[2] Another irony: God will ""gain,"" because he will have been proved right in his claim to the satan that Job is ""perfect."""
NABRE,18,22,6,"[3] 22:6-9 This criticism of Job by Eliphaz is untrue (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/31/19'>31:19</a>), but he is driven to it by his belief that God always acts justly, even when he causes someone to suffer; suffering is due to wrongdoing (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/18/22/29'>29</a>)."

NABRE,18,24,1,"[1] After his failure to find God, Job takes up the question: Why does God not favor his friends by the speedy punishment of his enemies?"
NABRE,18,24,9,"[2] This verse continues the description of the plight of the poor in vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/24/2'>2-4</a>, and may belong there."
NABRE,18,24,10,"[3] This verse is a variant of v. <a href='/NABRE/18/24/7'>7</a>, and may be an erroneous scribal repetition."
NABRE,18,24,18,"[4] 24:18-24 These verses are inconsistent with Jobs views elsewhere. Moreover, they are in general poorly preserved, and in some cases obscure."
NABRE,18,24,22,[5] He: God.
NABRE,18,25,1,"[1] At this point any structure in the dialogues disappears. Bildads speech is very short, and there follow two speeches attributed to Job, with significantly different introductions in <a href='/NABRE/18/27/1'>27:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/29/1'>29:1</a>, and with no intervening third speech of Zophar."
NABRE,18,25,3,"[2] His troops: the heavenly host, or army, the stars (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/5/20'>JUG 5:20</a>), later understood as angels."

NABRE,18,27,2,"[1] 27:2-6 As God lives…far be it: Job affirms two oaths about his innocence by the very God whom he has accused of violating his right. Such is the paradoxical situation of a tortured person who cannot give the lie to his personal justice, but also refuses to renounce God. He dares God to be ""just"" as he, Job, understands this."
NABRE,18,27,7,"[2] 27:7-23 These verses are inconsistent with Jobs views elsewhere, and may be part of a missing speech of Zophar; cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/18/24/18'>24:18-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/25/1'>25:1</a>. Or possibly they are an ironic description of the fate of the three friends."
NABRE,18,28,1,"[1] 28:1-28 This chapter contains a beautifully vivid description of that Wisdom which is beyond the attainment of creatures and known only to God. The pronouns referring to Wisdom may be translated as either feminine or neuter; in view of Wisdoms role as Gods companion and partner in creation (see <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>PRO 8:22-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/24/1'>SIR 24:1-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/9/9'>WIS 9:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/73/3/9'>BAR 3:9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/73/4/4'>4:4</a>), the feminine is used here. There is no consensus about the authorship of this poem; it may originally have been an independent composition incorporated into the Book of Job."
NABRE,18,28,3,"[2] 28:3-4 The subject of the verbs in these verses has no clear antecedent; the context of vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/28/2'>2-6</a> suggests miners. The Hebrew of v. <a href='/NABRE/18/28/4'>4</a> is especially difficult. The general sense of vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/28/1'>1-11</a> is that one can find minerals in the earth; in contrast, where is Wisdom to be found (vv. <a href='/NABRE/18/28/12'>12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/18/28/20'>20</a>)?"

NABRE,18,31,33,"[7] 31:33-34 Jobs present protest is made, not in spite of hidden sins which he had been unwilling to disclose, but out of genuine innocence. All too human: can also be translated ""like Adam."""

A young man, he impetuously and impatiently upbraids Job for his boldness toward God, and the three friends for not successfully answering Job. He undertakes to defend Gods absolute justice and to explain more clearly why there is suffering. While fundamentally his position is the same as that of the three friends, he locates the place of suffering in the divine plan. Because Elihus four speeches (<a href='/NABRE/18/32/6'>32:6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/33/33'>33:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/34/2'>34:2-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/35/2'>35:2-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/36/2'>36:2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/37/24'>37:24</a>) repeat the substance of the earlier arguments of the three friends and also anticipate the content of the divine speeches (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/18/39/1'>39</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/41/1'>41</a>), many scholars consider them a later addition to the book."

NABRE,18,33,23,"[4] Divine messenger: or ""angel,"" one of the thousands who serve as mediators."
NABRE,18,34,1,"[1] Elihu replies, although no one else has spoken. This connective phrase (see also <a href='/NABRE/18/35/1'>35:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/36/1'>36:1</a>) may indicate that these speeches of Elihu are a secondary addition to the book (see note on <a href='/NABRE/18/32/2'>32:2</a>)."

NABRE,18,35,14,"[3] 35:14-15 The text here is uncertain. It seems to indicate that Job should have realized Gods indifference is only apparent, and that, because he has not done so, God will punish him."

NABRE,18,36,22,"[3] 36:22-25 These verses serve as an introduction to the hymn about the divine marvels, 36:26-37:24, which in some respects anticipates the tone and content of the Lords speeches in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/18/38/1'>38</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/41/1'>41</a>."

NABRE,18,42,6,"[3] A difficult verse. Some doubt, in view of Gods commendation in v. <a href='/NABRE/18/42/7'>7</a>, that Job does in fact express repentance, and alternative translations are often given. Along with v. <a href='/NABRE/18/42/5'>5</a>, it describes a change in Job, which the encounter with the Lord has brought about. Dust and ashes: an ambiguous phrase. It can refer to the human condition (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/18/27'>GEN 18:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/30/19'>JOB 30:19</a>) or to Jobs ash heap (<a href='/NABRE/18/2/8'>2:8</a>)."

NABRE,19,6,6,"[3] A motive for God to preserve the psalmist from death: in the shadowy world of the dead no one offers you praise. Sheol is the biblical term for the underworld where the insubstantial souls of dead human beings dwelt. It was similar to the Hades of Greek and Latin literature.

NABRE,19,30,10,"[5] In the stillness of Sheol no one gives you praise; let me live and be among your worshipers, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/6/6'>PS 6:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/88/11'>88:11-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/115/17'>115:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/38/18'>ISA 38:18</a>."
NABRE,19,31,6,"[1] Into your hands I commend my spirit: in <a href='/NABRE/42/23/46'>LUK 23:46</a> Jesus breathes his last with this Psalm verse. Stephen in <a href='/NABRE/44/7/59'>ACT 7:59</a> alludes to these words as he is attacked by enemies. The verse is used as an antiphon in the Divine Office at Compline, the last prayer of the day."
NABRE,19,31,13,"[2] Like a worn-out tool: a common comparison for something ruined and useless, cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/14'>ISA 30:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/19/11'>JER 19:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/22/28'>22:28</a>."
NABRE,19,31,14,"[3] Terrors are all around me: a cry used in inescapable danger, cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/6/25'>JER 6:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/20/10'>20:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/46/5'>46:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/49/29'>49:29</a>."
NABRE,19,32,3,[1] I kept silent: did not confess the sin before God.
NABRE,19,32,6,"[2] Flood waters: the untamed waters surrounding the earth, a metaphor for danger."
NABRE,19,33,6,"[1] All their host: the stars of the sky are commonly viewed as a vast army, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/16/9/6'>NEH 9:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/40/26'>ISA 40:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/12'>45:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/33/22'>JER 33:22</a>."
NABRE,19,33,7,[2] The waters…as a mound: ancients sometimes attributed the power keeping the seas from overwhelming land to a primordial victory of the storm-god over personified Sea.
NABRE,19,34,1,"[1] Abimelech: a scribal error for Achish. In <a href='/NABRE/9/21/13'>1SM 21:13-16</a>, David feigned madness before Achish, not Abimelech."
NABRE,19,34,12,[2] Children: the customary term for students in wisdom literature.
NABRE,19,35,1,"[1] 35:1-6 The mixture of judicial, martial, and hunting images shows that the language is figurative. The actual injustice is false accusation of serious crimes (<a href='/NABRE/19/35/11'>PS 35:11, 15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/35/20'>20-21</a>). The psalmist seeks lost honor through a trial before God."
NABRE,19,35,13,"[2] 35:13, 15-17 The Hebrew is obscure."
NABRE,19,35,25,[3] Aha! Our soul!: an ancient idiomatic expression meaning that we have attained what we wanted.
NABRE,19,36,3,[1] Hated: punished by God.
NABRE,19,36,6,[2] 36:6-7 God actively controls the entire world.
NABRE,19,36,8,"[3] The shadow of your wings: metaphor for divine protection. It probably refers to the winged cherubim in the holy of holies in the Temple, cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/6/23'>1KG 6:23-28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/6/32'>32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/3/10'>2CH 3:10-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/1/4'>EZE 1:4-9</a>."
NABRE,19,37,3,"[1] The land: the promised land, Israel, which became for later interpreters a type or figure of heaven, cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/11/9'>HEB 11:9-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/11/13'>13-16</a>. The New Testament Beatitudes (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-26</a>) have been influenced by the Psalm, especially their total reversal of the present and their interpretation of the happy future as possession of the land."
NABRE,19,40,4,[1] A new song: a song in response to the new action of God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/33/3'>PS 33:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/96/1'>96:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/144/9'>144:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/149/1'>149:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/42/10'>ISA 42:10</a>). Giving thanks is not purely a human response but is itself a divine gift.
NABRE,19,40,7,[2] 40:7-9 Obedience is better than sacrifice (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/15/22'>1SM 15:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/1/10'>ISA 1:10-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/6/6'>HOS 6:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/5/22'>AMO 5:22-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/6/6'>MIC 6:6-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/7/42'>ACT 7:42-43</a> [quoting <a href='/NABRE/30/5/25'>AMO 5:25-26</a>]). <a href='/NABRE/58/10/5'>HEB 10:5-9</a> quotes the somewhat different Greek version and interprets it as Christs self-oblation.
NABRE,19,41,2,[1] Blessed the one concerned for the poor: cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/32/1'>PS 32:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/34/9'>34:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/40/5'>40:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/65/5'>65:5</a>. The psalmists statement about Gods love of the poor is based on the experience of being rescued (<a href='/NABRE/19/41/1'>PS 41:1-3</a>).
NABRE,19,41,4,[2] You turn down his bedding whenever he is ill: the Hebrew is obscure. It suggests ongoing attentive care of the one who is sick.
NABRE,19,41,10,"[3] Even my trusted friend…has raised his heel against me: <a href='/NABRE/43/13/18'>JHN 13:18</a> cites this verse to characterize Judas as a false friend. Raised his heel against me: an interpretation of the unclear Hebrew, ""made great the heel against me."""
NABRE,19,41,11,[4] That I may repay them: the healing itself is an act of judgment through which God decides for the psalmist and against the false friends. The prayer is not necessarily for strength to punish enemies.
NABRE,19,41,14,"[5] The doxology, not part of the Psalm, marks the end of the first of the five books of the Psalter, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/72/18'>PS 72:18-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/53'>89:53</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/106/48'>106:48</a>."
NABRE,19,42,1,[1] The Korahites: a major guild of Temple singers (<a href='/NABRE/14/20/19'>2CH 20:19</a>) whose name appears in the superscriptions of <a href='/NABRE/19/42/1'>PS 42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/44/1'>44</a>-<a href='/NABRE/19/49/1'>49</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/84/1'>84</a>-<a href='/NABRE/19/85/1'>85</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/87/1'>87</a>-<a href='/NABRE/19/88/1'>88</a>.
NABRE,19,42,3,"[2] See the face of God: ""face"" designates a personal presence (<a href='/NABRE/1/33/10'>GEN 33:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/10/28'>EXO 10:28-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/17/11'>2SM 17:11</a>). The expressions ""see God/Gods face"" occur elsewhere (<a href='/NABRE/19/11/7'>PS 11:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/17/15'>17:15</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/24/10'>EXO 24:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/33/7'>33:7-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/33/26'>JOB 33:26</a>) for the presence of God in the Temple."
NABRE,19,42,5,[3] The shrine of the Mighty One: this reading follows the tradition of the Septuagint and the Vulgate.
NABRE,19,42,7,[4] From the land of the Jordan: the sources of the Jordan are in the foothills of Mount Hermon in present-day southern Lebanon. Mount Mizar is presumed to be a mountain in the same range.
NABRE,19,42,8,"[5] Deep calls to deep: to the psalmist, the waters arising in the north are overwhelming and far from Gods presence, like the waters of chaos (<a href='/NABRE/19/18/5'>PS 18:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/69/2'>69:2-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/69/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/32/2/3'>JON 2:3-6</a>)."
NABRE,19,42,9,"[6] 42:9-10 I will pray…I will say: in the midst of his depression the psalmist turns to prayer. Despite his situation he trusts the Lord to deliver him from his sorrow so that he may enter the Temple precincts and praise him once again (<a href='/NABRE/19/43/3'>PS 43:3-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/43/5'>5</a>b)."
NABRE,19,43,3,[1] Your light and your fidelity: a pair of divine attributes personified as guides for the pilgrimage. As in <a href='/NABRE/19/42/9'>PS 42:9</a> the psalmist prays that these divine attributes lead him back to Jerusalem and ultimately to Gods presence in the Temple.
NABRE,19,44,11,"[1] You make us retreat: the corollary of <a href='/NABRE/19/44/3'>PS 44:3</a>. Defeat, like victory, is Gods doing; neither Israel nor its enemies can claim credit (<a href='/NABRE/19/44/23'>PS 44:23</a>)."
NABRE,19,44,19,[2] Our hearts have not turned back: Israels defeat was not caused by its lack of fidelity.
NABRE,19,44,20,"[3] A place of jackals: following Israels defeat and exile (<a href='/NABRE/19/44/11'>PS 44:11-12</a>), the land lies desolate, inhabited only by jackals, cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/22'>ISA 13:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/9/10'>JER 9:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/10/22'>10:22</a>. Others take tannimas ""sea monster"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/29/3'>EZE 29:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/32/2'>32:2</a>) and render: ""you crushed us as you did the sea monster."""
NABRE,19,45,7,"[1] O God: the king, in courtly language, is called ""god,"" i.e., more than human, representing God to the people. <a href='/NABRE/58/1/8'>HEB 1:8-9</a> applies <a href='/NABRE/19/45/7'>PS 45:7-8</a> to Christ."
NABRE,19,45,9,"[2] Ivory-paneled palaces: lit., ""palaces of ivory."" Ivory paneling and furniture decoration have been found in Samaria and other ancient Near Eastern cities, cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/3/15'>AMO 3:15</a>."
NABRE,19,45,10,"[3] Ophirs gold: uncertain location, possibly a region on the coast of southern Arabia or eastern Africa, famous for its gold, cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/9/28'>1KG 9:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/10/11'>10:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/22/24'>JOB 22:24</a>."
NABRE,19,45,11,"[4] Forget your people and your fathers house: the bride should no longer consider herself a daughter of her fathers house, but the wife of the king—the queen."
NABRE,19,46,1,"[1] Alamoth: the melody of the Psalm, now lost."
NABRE,19,46,3,[2] 46:3-4 Figurative ancient Near Eastern language to describe social and political upheavals.
NABRE,19,46,5,[3] Jerusalem is not situated on a river. This description derives from mythological descriptions of the divine abode and symbolizes the divine presence as the source of all life (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/21'>ISA 33:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/47/1'>EZE 47:1-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/4/18'>JOE 4:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/14/8'>ZEC 14:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/22/1'>REV 22:1-2</a>).
NABRE,19,46,8,"[4] The first line of the refrain is similar in structure and meaning to Isaiahs name for the royal child, Emmanuel, With us is God (<a href='/NABRE/23/7/14'>ISA 7:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/8/8'>8:8, 10</a>)."
NABRE,19,47,5,"[1] Our heritage…the glory: the land of Israel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/58/14'>ISA 58:14</a>), which God has given Israel in an act of sovereignty."
NABRE,19,47,6,[2] God has gone up: Christian liturgical tradition has applied the verse to the Ascension of Christ.
NABRE,19,48,1,[1] Korahites: see note on <a href='/NABRE/19/42/1'>PS 42:1</a>.
NABRE,19,48,3,"[2] The heights of Zaphon: the mountain abode of the Canaanite storm-god Baal in comparable texts. To speak of Zion as if it were Zaphon was to claim for Israels God what Canaanites claimed for Baal. Though topographically speaking Zion is only a hill, viewed religiously it towers over other mountains as the home of the supreme God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/68/16'>PS 68:16-17</a>)."
NABRE,19,48,6,"[3] When they looked: the kings are stunned by the sight of Zion, touched by divine splendor. The language is that of holy war, in which the enemy panics and flees at the sight of divine glory."
NABRE,19,48,8,"[4] The ships of Tarshish: large ships, named after the distant land or port of Tarshish, probably ancient Tartessus in southern Spain, although other identifications have been proposed, cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/16'>ISA 2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/9'>60:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/32/1/3'>JON 1:3</a>."
NABRE,19,48,9,[5] What we had heard we have now seen: the glorious things that new pilgrims had heard about the holy city—its beauty and awesomeness—they now see with their own eyes. The seeing here contrasts with the seeing of the hostile kings in <a href='/NABRE/19/48/6'>PS 48:6</a>.
NABRE,19,48,15,"[6] Our God for ever and ever: Israels God is like Zion in being eternal and invincible. The holy city is therefore a kind of ""sacrament"" of God."
NABRE,19,49,1,[1] Korahites: see note on <a href='/NABRE/19/42/1'>PS 42:1</a>.
NABRE,19,49,5,[2] Riddle: the psalmists personal solution to the perennial biblical problem of the prosperity of the wicked. Question: parallel in meaning to problem; in wisdom literature it means the mysterious way of how the world works.
NABRE,19,49,8,"[3] No man can ransom even a brother: an axiom. For the practice of redemption, cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/6/21'>JOB 6:21-23</a>. A play on the first Hebrew word of <a href='/NABRE/19/49/8'>PS 49:8, 16</a> relates the two verses."
NABRE,19,49,16,"[4] Will take me: the same Hebrew verb is used of God ""taking up"" a favored servant: Enoch in <a href='/NABRE/1/5/24'>GEN 5:24</a>; Elijah in <a href='/NABRE/12/2/11'>2KG 2:11-12</a>; the righteous person in <a href='/NABRE/19/73/24'>PS 73:24</a>. The verse apparently states the hope that God will rescue the faithful psalmist in the same manner."
NABRE,19,51,7,"[1] In sin my mother conceived me: lit., ""In iniquity was I conceived,"" an instance of hyperbole: at no time was the psalmist ever without sin, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/88/15'>PS 88:15</a>, ""I am mortally afflicted since youth,"" i.e., I have always been afflicted. The verse does not imply that the sexual act of conception is sinful."
NABRE,19,51,9,"[2] Hyssop: a small bush whose many woody twigs make a natural sprinkler. It was prescribed in the Mosaic law as an instrument for sprinkling sacrificial blood or lustral water for cleansing, cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/12/22'>EXO 12:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/14/4'>LEV 14:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/19/18'>NUM 19:18</a>."
NABRE,19,51,18,"[3] For you do not desire sacrifice: the mere offering of the ritual sacrifice apart from good dispositions is not acceptable to God, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/50/1'>PS 50</a>."
NABRE,19,51,20,[4] 51:20-21 Most scholars think that these verses were added to the Psalm some time after the destruction of the Temple in 587 B.C. The verses assume that the rebuilt Temple will be an ideal site for national reconciliation.
NABRE,19,52,10,"[1] Like an olive tree: the righteous will flourish in the house of God like a well-watered olive tree, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/92/14'>PS 92:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/128/3'>128:3</a>."
NABRE,19,54,3,"[1] By your name: one is present in ones name, hence God as revealed to human beings."
NABRE,19,56,1,[1] Yonath elem rehoqim: Hebrew words probably designating the melody to which the Psalm was to be sung.
NABRE,19,56,9,[2] Are my tears not stored in your flask: a unique saying in the Old Testament. The context suggests that the tears are saved because they are precious; God puts a high value on each of the psalmists troubles.
NABRE,19,57,1,[1] Do not destroy: probably the title of the melody to which the Psalm was to be sung.
NABRE,19,57,2,[2] The shadow of your wings: probably refers to the wings of the cherubim (powerful winged animals) whose wings spread over the ark in the inner chamber of the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/23'>1KG 6:23-28</a>).
NABRE,19,57,9,[3] I will wake the dawn: by a bold figure the psalmist imagines the sound of music and singing will waken a new day.
NABRE,19,58,1,[1] Do not destroy: probably the title of the melody to which the Psalm was to be sung.
NABRE,19,58,2,"[2] Gods: the Bible sometimes understands pagan gods to be lesser divine beings who are assigned by Israels God to rule the foreign nations. Here they are accused of injustice, permitting the human judges under their patronage to abuse the righteous, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/82/1'>PS 82</a>."
NABRE,19,58,5,[3] 58:5-6 The image is that of a poisonous snake that is controlled by the voice or piping of its trainer.
NABRE,19,58,9,[4] A snail that oozes away: empty shells suggested to ancients that snails melted away as they left a slimy trail.
NABRE,19,59,1,[1] Do not destroy: probably the title of the melody to which the Psalm was to be sung.
NABRE,19,59,8,[2] Who is there to hear?: a sample of the enemies godless reflection. The answer is that God hears their blasphemies.
NABRE,19,60,7,[1] 60:7-12 These verses occur again as the second half of <a href='/NABRE/19/108/1'>PS 108</a>.
NABRE,19,60,8,[2] I will…apportion…measure out: God lays claim to these places. The valley of Succoth: probably the lower stretch of the Jabbok valley.
NABRE,19,60,8,[3] I will…apportion…measure out: God lays claim to these places. The valley of Succoth: probably the lower stretch of the Jabbok valley.
NABRE,19,60,9,"[4] Judah, my own scepter: an allusion to the Testament of Jacob, <a href='/NABRE/1/49/10'>GEN 49:10</a>."
NABRE,19,60,10,"[5] Moab is my washbowl: Moab borders the Dead Sea, hence a metaphor for the country. Upon Edom I cast my sandal: an ancient legal gesture of taking possession of land."
NABRE,19,60,10,"[6] Moab is my washbowl: Moab borders the Dead Sea, hence a metaphor for the country. Upon Edom I cast my sandal: an ancient legal gesture of taking possession of land."
NABRE,19,60,11,"[7] The fortified city: perhaps Bozrah, the fortified capital of Edom, cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/34/6'>ISA 34:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/63/1'>63:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/1/12'>AMO 1:12</a>."
NABRE,19,61,3,"[1] Ends of the earth: ""earth"" being taken in its occasional meaning ""the underworld,"" cf. <a href='/NABRE/32/2/3'>JON 2:3</a>."
NABRE,19,61,8,[2] Send your love and fidelity: as in <a href='/NABRE/19/43/3'>PS 43:3</a> the psalmist asks God to send these two divine attributes like angels to protect the king.
NABRE,19,62,1,[1] Al Jeduthun: apparently the Hebrew name for the melody.
NABRE,19,62,10,[2] On a balance they rise: precious objects were weighed by balancing two pans suspended from a beam. The lighter pan rises.
NABRE,19,62,12,"[3] One thing…two things: parallelism of numbers for the sake of variation, a common device in Semitic poetry. One should not literally add up the numbers, cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/1/3'>AMO 1:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/16'>PRO 6:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/30/15'>30:15, 18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/30/21'>21</a>."
NABRE,19,63,4,[1] For your love is better than life: only here in the Old Testament is anything prized above life—in this case Gods love.
NABRE,19,63,12,[2] All who swear by the Lord: to swear by a particular god meant that one was a worshiper of that god (<a href='/NABRE/23/45/23'>ISA 45:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/48/1'>48:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/36/1/5'>ZEP 1:5</a>).
NABRE,19,65,2,[1] Vows: the Israelites were accustomed to promising sacrifices in the Temple if their prayers were heard.
NABRE,19,65,3,[2] To you all flesh must come: all must have recourse to Gods mercy.
NABRE,19,65,6,"[3] Awesome deeds: the acts of creating—installing mountains, taming seas, restraining nations (<a href='/NABRE/19/65/7'>PS 65:7-8</a>)—that are visible worldwide (<a href='/NABRE/19/65/6'>PS 65:6, 9</a>)."
NABRE,19,65,10,"[4] 65:10-14 Apparently a description of the agricultural year, beginning with the first fall rains that soften the hard sun-baked soil (<a href='/NABRE/19/65/9'>PS 65:9-10</a>)."
NABRE,19,65,10,[5] Gods stream: the fertile waters of the earth derive from Gods fertile waters in the heavenly world.
NABRE,19,65,12,[6] Paths: probably the tracks of Gods storm chariot dropping rain upon earth.
NABRE,19,66,5,"[1] 66:5-6 cf. the events described in <a href='/NABRE/2/14/1'>EXO 14:1-15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/14/21'>21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/3/11'>JOS 3:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/4/24'>4:24</a> and <a href='/NABRE/19/114/1'>PS 114</a>."
NABRE,19,66,12,"[2] You let captors set foot on our neck: lit., ""you let men mount our heads."" Conquerors placed their feet on the neck of their enemies as a sign of complete defeat, cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/10/24'>JOS 10:24</a>. A ceremonial footstool of the Egyptian king Tutankhamen portrays bound and prostrate bodies of enemies ready for the kings feet on their heads, and one of Tutankhamens ceremonial chariots depicts the king as a sphinx standing with paw atop the neck of an enemy."
NABRE,19,66,13,[3] Burnt offerings: cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/1/3'>LEV 1:3-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/6/1'>6:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/22/17'>22:17-20</a>.
NABRE,19,67,2,"[1] May God be gracious to us: the peoples petition echoes the blessing pronounced upon them by the priests, cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/6/22'>NUM 6:22-27</a>."
NABRE,19,68,2,[1] The opening line alluding to <a href='/NABRE/4/10/35'>NUM 10:35</a> makes clear that Gods assistance in the period of the exodus and conquest is the model and assurance of all future divine help.
NABRE,19,68,5,"[2] Exalt the rider of the clouds: Gods intervention is in the imagery of Canaanite myth in which the storm-god mounted the storm clouds to ride to battle.

NABRE,19,73,9,"[1] They set their mouths against the heavens: in an image probably derived from mythic stories of half-divine giants, the monstrous speech of the wicked is likened to enormous jaws gaping wide, devouring everything in sight."
NABRE,19,73,10,[2] The Hebrew is obscure.
NABRE,19,73,17,[3] And came to understand their end: the psalmist receives a double revelation in the Temple: 1) the end of the wicked comes unexpectedly (<a href='/NABRE/19/73/18'>PS 73:18-20</a>); 2) God is with me.
NABRE,19,73,24,"[4] And at the end receive me with honor: a perhaps deliberately enigmatic verse. It is understood by some commentators as reception into heavenly glory, hence the traditional translation, ""receive me into glory."" The Hebrew verb can indeed refer to mysterious divine elevation of a righteous person into Gods domain: Enoch in <a href='/NABRE/1/5/24'>GEN 5:24</a>; Elijah in <a href='/NABRE/12/2/11'>2KG 2:11-12</a>; the righteous psalmist in <a href='/NABRE/19/49/16'>PS 49:16</a>. Personal resurrection in the Old Testament, however, is clearly attested only in the second century B.C. The verse is perhaps best left unspecified as a reference to Gods nearness and protection."

NABRE,19,74,1,"[1] Forever: the word implies that the disaster is already of long duration, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/74/9'>PS 74:9</a> and note."
NABRE,19,74,9,"[2] Even so we have seen no signs…: ancients often asked prophets to say for how long a divine punishment was to last, cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/24/13'>2SM 24:13</a>. Here no prophet has arisen to indicate the duration."
NABRE,19,74,11,"[3] Why hold back…within your bosom: i.e., idle beneath your cloak."
NABRE,19,74,12,"[4] 74:12-17 Comparable Canaanite literature describes the storm-gods victory over all-encompassing Sea and its allies (dragons and Leviathan) and the subsequent peaceful arrangement of the universe, sometimes through the placement of paired cosmic elements (day and night, sun and moon), cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/89/12'>PS 89:12-13</a>. The Psalm apparently equates the enemies attacking the Temple with the destructive cosmic forces already tamed by God. Why then are those forces now raging untamed against your own people?"
NABRE,19,74,15,"[5] Waters: lit., ""rivers"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/24/7'>PS 24:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/50/2'>ISA 50:2</a>) upon which, or from which, in primordial times the earth is created."
NABRE,19,75,2,[1] You said: supplied for clarity here and in <a href='/NABRE/19/75/11'>PS 75:11</a>. The translation assumes in both places that the psalmist is citing an oracle of God.

NABRE,19,77,11,"[1] I conclude: lit., ""I said."" The psalmist, after pondering the present distress and Gods promises to Israel, has decided that God has forgotten the people."
NABRE,19,77,12,"[2] I will recall: the verb sometimes means to make present the great deeds of Israels past by reciting them, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/78/42'>PS 78:42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/105/5'>105:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/106/7'>106:7</a>."
NABRE,19,77,17,"[3] The deeps of the sea: Heb. tehom; the same word is used in <a href='/NABRE/1/1/2'>GEN 1:2</a>, where it alludes to the primeval seas which in ancient Semitic cosmography are tamed by God in creation, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/74/12'>PS 74:12-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/12'>89:12-13</a> and notes."
NABRE,19,78,2,"[1] Parable: Hebrew mashalliterally refers to some sort of relationship of comparison and can signify a story whose didactic potential becomes clear in the telling, as here in the retrospective examination of the history of Israel. <a href='/NABRE/40/13/35'>MAT 13:35</a> cites the verse to explain Jesus use of parables."
NABRE,19,78,9,"[2] Ephraimite archers: Ephraim was the most important tribe of the Northern Kingdom. Its military defeat (here unspecified) demonstrates its infidelity to God, who otherwise would have protected it."

Unlike <a href='/NABRE/2/16/1'>EXO 16</a>, here both manna and quail are instruments of punishment, showing that a divine gift can become deadly because of Israels apostasy."
NABRE,19,78,25,"[5] Bread of the angels: the translation ""angels"" comports with the supernatural origin of the manna, though the Hebrew lechem abbirimis more literally translated as ""bread of the strong ones"" or ""bread of the mighty."" In the context of the manna event, this phrase cannot possibly mean the Israelites or any human being."
NABRE,19,78,35,[6] Remembered: invoked God publicly in worship. Their words were insincere (<a href='/NABRE/19/78/36'>PS 78:36</a>).

NABRE,19,110,7,"[4] Who drinks from the brook by the wayside: the meaning is uncertain. Some see an allusion to a rite of royal consecration at the Gihon spring (cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/1/33'>1KG 1:33, 38</a>).

NABRE,19,116,3,"[1] The cords of death: death is personified here; it attempts to capture the psalmist with snares and nets, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/18/6'>PS 18:6</a>."
NABRE,19,116,9,[2] The land of the living: the phrase elsewhere is an epithet of the Jerusalem Temple (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/27/13'>PS 27:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/52/5'>52:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/38/11'>ISA 38:11</a>). Hence the psalmist probably refers to being present to God in the Temple.
NABRE,19,116,10,"[3] I kept faith, even when I said: even in the days of despair, the psalmist did not lose all hope."
NABRE,19,116,13,"[4] The cup of salvation: probably the libation of wine poured out in gratitude for rescue, cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/25/29'>EXO 25:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/15/5'>NUM 15:5, 7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/4/15/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,19,116,15,"[5] Dear in the eyes of the Lord: the meaning is that the death of Gods faithful is grievous to God, not that God is pleased with the death, cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/72/14'>PS 72:14</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/70/3/5'>WIS 3:5-6</a>, God accepts the death of the righteous as a sacrificial burnt offering."
NABRE,19,118,22,"[1] The stone the builders rejected: a proverb: what is insignificant to human beings has become great through divine election. The ""stone"" may originally have meant the foundation stone or capstone of the Temple. The New Testament interpreted the verse as referring to the death and resurrection of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/42'>MAT 21:42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/4/11'>ACT 4:11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/28/16'>ISA 28:16</a> and <a href='/NABRE/45/9/33'>ROM 9:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/2/7'>1PE 2:7</a>)."

NABRE,19,119,19,"[1] A sojourner in the land: like someone without the legal protection of a native inhabitant, the psalmist has a special need for the guidance of Gods teaching."
NABRE,19,119,48,[2] I lift up my hands to your commandments: to lift up the hands was an ancient gesture of reverence to God. Here the picture is applied to Gods law.
NABRE,19,119,89,"[3] 119:89-91 Gods word creates the world, which manifests that word by its permanence and reliability."
NABRE,19,119,97,"[4] Lord: the inclusion of ""Lord"" follows the tradition of the Septuagint and the Vulgate."
NABRE,19,120,1,"[1] A song of ascents: <a href='/NABRE/19/120/1'>PS 120</a>-<a href='/NABRE/19/134/1'>134</a> all begin with this superscription. Most probably these fifteen Psalms once formed a collection of Psalms sung when pilgrims went to Jerusalem, since one ""ascended"" to Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/28'>1KG 12:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/24/3'>PS 24:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/122/4'>122:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/2/42'>LUK 2:42</a>) or to the house of God or to an altar (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/33'>1KG 12:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/2'>2KG 23:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/24/3'>PS 24:3</a>). Less probable is the explanation that these Psalms were sung by the exiles when they ""ascended"" to Jerusalem from Babylonia (cf. <a href='/NABRE/15/7/9'>EZR 7:9</a>). The idea, found in the Mishnah, that the fifteen steps on which the Levites sang corresponded to these fifteen Psalms (Middot <a href='/NABRE/19/2/5'>2:5</a>) must underlie the Vulgate translation canticum graduum, ""song of the steps"" or ""gradual song."""
NABRE,19,120,3,"[2] More besides: a common curse formula in Hebrew was ""May the Lord do such and such evils to you [the evils being specified], and add still more to them,"" cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/3/17'>1SM 3:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/14/44'>14:44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/25/22'>25:22</a>. Here the psalmist is at a loss for a suitable malediction."
NABRE,19,120,4,[3] Coals of brush wood: coals made from the stalk of the broom plant burn with intense heat. The psalmist thinks of lighted coals cast at his enemies.
NABRE,19,120,5,[4] Meshech was in the far north (<a href='/NABRE/1/10/2'>GEN 10:2</a>) and Kedar was a tribe of the north Arabian desert (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/13'>GEN 25:13</a>). The psalmist may be thinking generally of all aliens living among inhospitable peoples.
NABRE,19,121,1,"[1] The mountains: possibly Mount Zion, the site of the Temple and hence of safety, but more probably mountains as a place of dangers, causing anxiety to the psalmist."
NABRE,19,121,5,"[2] 121:5-6 The image of shade, a symbol of protection, is apt: God as shade protects from the harmful effects that ancients believed were caused by the sun and moon."
NABRE,19,122,3,"[1] Walled round about: lit., ""which is joined to it,"" probably referring both to the density of the buildings and to the dense population."

NABRE,19,125,3,"[1] The land allotted to the just: lit., ""the lot of the righteous."" The promised land was divided among the tribes of Israel by lot (<a href='/NABRE/4/26/55'>NUM 26:55</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/18/1'>JOS 18</a>). The righteous are the members of the people who are obedient to God. If the domination of the wicked were to continue in the land, even the just would be infected by their evil attitudes."
NABRE,19,126,4,[1] Like the dry stream beds of the Negeb: the psalmist prays for rain in such abundance that the dry riverbeds will run.
NABRE,19,127,5,"[1] At the gate: the reference is not to enemies besieging the walls of a city but to adversaries in litigation. Law courts functioned in the open area near the main city gate. The more adult sons a man had, the more forceful he would appear in disputes, cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/23'>PRO 31:23</a>."
NABRE,19,129,4,"[1] The ropes of the wicked: usually understood as the rope for yoking animals to the plow. If it is severed, the plowing (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/129/3'>PS 129:3</a>) comes to a halt."
NABRE,19,129,6,"[2] Like grass on the rooftops: after the spring rains, grass would sprout from the coat of mud with which the flat roofs of simple houses were covered, but when the dry summer began there was no moisture in the thin roof-covering to sustain the grass."
NABRE,19,129,8,"[3] The blessing of the Lordbe upon you: harvesters greeted one another with such blessings, cf. <a href='/NABRE/8/2/4'>RUT 2:4</a>."
NABRE,19,130,1,"[1] The depths: Sheol here is a metaphor of total misery. Deep anguish makes the psalmist feel ""like those descending to the pit"" (<a href='/NABRE/19/143/7'>PS 143:7</a>)."

NABRE,20,1,8,"[6] 1:8-19 A parental warning to a young person leaving home, for them to avoid the company of the greedy and violent. Two ways lie before the hearer, a way that leads to death and a way that leads to life. The trap which the wicked set for the innocent (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/11'>11</a>) in the end takes away the lives of the wicked themselves (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/19'>19</a>). This theme will recur especially in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9</a>. A second theme introduced here is that of founding (or managing) a household and choosing a spouse. A third theme is the human obstacles to attaining wisdom. Here (and in <a href='/NABRE/20/2/12'>2:12-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/4/10'>4:10-19</a>), the obstacle is men (always in the plural); in <a href='/NABRE/20/2/16'>2:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5:1-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a>; chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/9/13'>9:13-18</a>, the obstacle to the quest is the ""foreign"" woman (always in the singular)."
NABRE,20,1,17,"[7] A difficult verse. The most probable interpretation is that no fowler lifts up the net so the bird can see it. The verse might be paraphrased: God does not let those who walk on evil paths see the net that will entrap them. The passive construction (""a net is spread"") is sometimes used to express divine activity. Verse 16 is a later attempt to add clarity. It is a quotation from <a href='/NABRE/23/59/7'>ISA 59:7</a> and is not in the best Greek manuscripts."
NABRE,20,1,20,"[8] 1:20-33 Wisdom is personified as in chaps. 8 and <a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9:1-6</a>. With divine authority she proclaims the moral order, threatening to leave to their own devices those who disregard her invitation. All three speeches of Woman Wisdom have common features: a setting in city streets; an audience of simple or naive people; a competing appeal (chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a> is the competing appeal for chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/1'>8</a>); an invitation to a relationship that brings long life, riches, repute. The structure of the speeches is: A: setting (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/20'>20-21</a>); B: Wisdoms withdrawal, rebuke and announcement (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/22'>22-23</a>); reason and rejection I (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/24'>24-27</a>); reason and rejection II (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/28'>28-31</a>); summary (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/32'>32</a>); C: the effects of Wisdoms presence (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/33'>33</a>). Wisdoms opening speech is an extended threat ending with a brief invitation (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/33'>33</a>). Her second speech is an extended invitation ending with a brief threat (<a href='/NABRE/20/8/36'>8:36</a>). The surprisingly abrupt and harsh tone of her speech is perhaps to be explained as a response to the arrogant words of the men in the previous scene (<a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>1:8-19</a>)."
NABRE,20,1,22,"[9] 1:22-23 There is textual confusion. Verse 22bc (in the third person) is an addition, interrupting vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/22'>22a, 23</a>a (in the second person). The addition has been put in brackets, to separate it from the original poem. The original verses do not ask for a change of heart but begin to detail the consequences of disobedience to Wisdom."
NABRE,20,1,31,"[10] Eat the fruit: sinners are punished by the consequences of their sins. Wisdoms voice echoes that of the parents in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>8-19</a>. The parents mediate wisdom in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>8-19</a>, but here Wisdom herself speaks."
NABRE,20,2,1,"[1] 2:1-22 Chapter 2 is a single poem, an acrostic of twenty-two lines, the number of consonants in the Hebrew alphabet. In vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/2/1'>1-11</a>, the letter aleph, the first letter of the alphabet, predominates, and in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/2/12'>12-22</a>, the letter lamed, the first letter of the second half of the alphabet. A single structure runs through the whole: if (aleph) you search…then (aleph) the Lord/Wisdom will grant…saving (lamed) you from the wicked man/woman…thus (lamed) you can walk in the safe way…."
NABRE,20,2,2,[2] 2:2-3 Wisdom…understanding…intelligence: various names or aspects of the same gift.
NABRE,20,2,12,"[3] 2:12-15 As in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>1:8-19</a>, there is an obstacle to the quest for wisdom—deceitful and violent men. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/20/4/10'>4:10-19</a>. They offer a way of life that is opposed to the way of wisdom."
NABRE,20,2,16,"[4] 2:16-19 A second obstacle and counter-figure to Wisdom, personified as an attractive woman, is the ""stranger,"" or ""foreigner,"" from outside the territory or kinship group, hence inappropriate as a marriage partner. In Proverbs she comes to be identified with Woman Folly, whose deceitful words promise life but lead to death. Woman Folly appears also in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a>, chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/9/13'>9:13-18</a>. Covenant: refers to the vow uttered with divine sanction at the womans previous marriage, as the parallel verse suggests. She is already married and relations with her would be adulterous."
NABRE,20,2,18,[5] Shades: the inhabitants of Sheol.
NABRE,20,2,21,"[6] 2:21-22 Verses 21-22 echo the ending of Wisdoms speech in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/32'>1:32-33</a>, in which refusing Wisdoms invitation meant death and obedience to her meant life. The same set of ideas is found in <a href='/NABRE/19/37/1'>PS 37</a> (especially vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/2/3'>3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/2/9'>9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/2/11'>11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/2/22'>22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/2/29'>29</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/2/34'>34</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/2/38'>38</a>): to live on (or inherit) the land and to be uprooted from the land are expressions of divine recompense."
NABRE,20,3,1,"[1] 3:1-12 The instruction consists of a series of six four-line exhortations in which the second line of each exhortation mentions a reward or benefit. In the first five exhortations, the teacher promises a reward: long life, a good name, divine protection, health, abundant crops. The last exhortation, vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/11'>11-12</a>, departs from the command-reward scheme, implying that being a disciple of the Lord does not guarantee unalloyed bliss: one must allow God freedom to ""reprove"" or educate. The process of education is like that described in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/2/1'>2</a>: the father first invites his son (or disciple) to memorize his teaching (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/1'>1</a>), then to enter upon a relationship of trust with him (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/3'>3</a>), and finally to place his trust in God, who takes up the parental task of education (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/5'>5</a>). Education begun by the parent is brought to full completion by God."
NABRE,20,3,1,"[2] Do not forget: this word and several others in the section such as ""teaching,"" ""commands,"" ""years of life,"" and the custom of affixing written teaching to ones body, occur also in Deuteronomy. This vocabulary suggests that Proverbs and Deuteronomy had a common origin in the scribal class of Jerusalem. This section (and vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/21'>21-34</a>) subtly elaborates <a href='/NABRE/5/6/5'>DEU 6:5-9</a>, ""You shall love the Lordwith all your heart (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/5'>5</a>)…Take to heart these words (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/1'>1</a>)…Recite them when you are at home and when you are away (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/23'>23</a>)…when you lie down (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/24'>24</a>)…Bind them (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/3'>3</a>) on your arm as a sign and let them be a pendant on your forehead"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/21'>21</a>)."
NABRE,20,3,12,"[3] One might be tempted to judge the quality of ones relationship to God by ones prosperity. It is an inadequate criterion, for God as a teacher might go counter to student expectations. The discipline of God can involve suffering."
NABRE,20,3,13,"[4] 3:13-20 An encomium of Wisdom through the listing of her benefits to the human race and the depiction of her role in creation. Wisdom, or understanding, is more valuable than silver and gold. Its fruit is long life, riches, honor and happiness (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/13'>13-18</a>). Even the creation of the universe and its adornment (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>GEN 1</a>) were not done without wisdom (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/19'>19-20</a>). The praise of Wisdom foreshadows the praise of a noble wife in the final poem (<a href='/NABRE/20/31/10'>31:10-31</a>), even to the singling out of the hands extended in a helpful way toward human beings."
NABRE,20,3,18,"[5] A tree of life: in the Old Testament this phrase occurs only in Proverbs (<a href='/NABRE/20/11/30'>11:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/13/12'>13:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/15/4'>15:4</a>) and Genesis (<a href='/NABRE/20/2/9'>2:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/3/22'>3:22, 24</a>). The origins of the concept are obscure; there is no explicit mention of it in ancient Near Eastern literature, though on ancient seals trees are sometimes identified as trees of life. When the man and the woman were expelled from the garden, the tree of life was put off limits to them, lest they ""eat of it and live forever"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/22'>GEN 3:22</a>). The quest for wisdom gives access to the previously sequestered tree of life. The tree of life is mentioned also in the apocryphal work 1 Enoch <a href='/NABRE/20/25/4'>25:4-5</a>. <a href='/NABRE/66/2/1'>REV 2</a> and <a href='/NABRE/66/2/22'>22</a> mention the tree of life as a source of eternal life."
NABRE,20,3,20,"[6] Depths: for the Hebrews, the depths enclosed the great subterranean waters; the rain and dew descended from the waters above the firmament; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/6'>GEN 1:6-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/26/8'>JOB 26:8, 12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/18/15'>PS 18:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/24/2'>24:2</a>. The cosmogony provides the reason why Wisdom offers such benefits to human beings: the world was created in wisdom so that all who live in accord with wisdom live in tune with the universe."
NABRE,20,3,21,"[7] 3:21-35 As in other instructions, the father in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/21'>21-26</a> urges the son to seek wisdom, which in this case means practicing the virtues of ""deliberation and planning,"" a specification of wisdom. Practicing these virtues brings protection from violence (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/22'>22-26</a>) and friendship with God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/32'>32-35</a>). The language is like <a href='/NABRE/19/91/1'>PS 91</a>. Verses 27-35 are arranged according to a clear order. Serving God requires serving ones neighbor through kindness (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/27'>27-28</a>), maintaining peace with the good (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/29'>29-31</a>), having no envy of the wicked (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/31'>31</a>), because the Lords friendship and kindness are with the just, not with the wicked. Matching the six exhortations of vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/1'>1-12</a>, vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/3/27'>27-34</a> contain six prohibitions. The righteous/wicked contrast is progressively developed: in contrast to the wicked, the righteous are in Gods inner circle, their houses are blessed, they deal with a merciful God, and obtain honor."
NABRE,20,3,22,"[8] Your soul: Heb. nepheshmeans ""throat, esophagus; life; soul."" The meanings are connected. The throat area is the moist, breathing center of the body, which stands for life and for self. The figure of speech is called metonymy, in which one word is substituted for another on the basis of a causal relation, e.g., eye for sight, arm for power, or, as here, ""throat area"" for life. Proverbs sometimes plays on this concrete meaning of life (e.g., 21:23)."
NABRE,20,4,1,"[1] 4:1-9 The teacher draws a parallel between his teaching the disciples now and his fathers teaching him in his youth (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/3'>3-4</a>): what my father taught me about wisdom is what I am teaching you. The poem implies that the teacher has acquired wisdom and has in fact been protected and honored as his father promised long ago. Thus the teacher has the authority of someone who has been under wisdoms sway since earliest youth. There are two sections, a call for attention and introduction of the speaker (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/1'>1-3</a>) and the fathers quoting of his own fathers teaching (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/4'>4-9</a>). Beginning with v. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/5'>5</a>, the fathers words are no longer quoted, wisdom herself becoming the active agent; she becomes the subject, not the object, of the verbs. Three Hebrew verbs are repeated in the two parts, ""to forsake"" in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/4/6'>6</a>, ""to keep/guard"" in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/4/6'>6</a>, and ""to give/bestow"" in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/4/9'>9</a>. Each verb in its first appearance has the fathers words as its object; in its second appearance each verb has wisdom as its subject or object. The teaching process is like that in <a href='/NABRE/20/2/1'>2:1-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/3/1'>3:1-12</a>: heeding the words of ones parent puts one in touch with wisdom, who completes the process and bestows her gifts."
NABRE,20,4,5,"[2] 4:5, 7 Get wisdom: the same Hebrew word ""to get"" can mean to acquire merchandise and to acquire a wife (<a href='/NABRE/20/18/22'>18:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/31/10'>31:10</a>); both meanings are in keeping with Proverbs metaphors of acquiring wisdom over gold and silver and of acquiring wisdom as a personified woman, a wife."
NABRE,20,4,10,"[3] 4:10-19 A central metaphor of the poem is ""the way."" The way of wisdom leads directly to life (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/10'>10-13</a>); it is a light that grows brighter (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/18'>18</a>). The wise are bound to shun (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/14'>14-17</a>) the dark and violent path of the wicked (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/19'>19</a>). Singleness of purpose and right conduct proceed from the heart of the wise as from the source of life (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/23'>23-26</a>), saving them from destruction on evil paths (<a href='/NABRE/20/4/27'>4:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/5/21'>5:21-23</a>). As in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>1:8-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/2/12'>2:12-15</a>, the obstacles to the quest are men and their way. Elsewhere in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9</a>, the obstacle is the foreign woman (<a href='/NABRE/20/2/16'>2:16-19</a>; chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a>; chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/9/13'>9:13-18</a>)."
NABRE,20,4,14,[4] 4:14-15 One is always free to choose. The righteous may choose to leave their path to walk on the wicked path and the wicked may choose the righteous path.
NABRE,20,4,18,"[5] Till perfect day: lit., ""till the day is established""; this may refer to full daylight or to noonday."
NABRE,20,4,20,"[6] 4:20-27 Acquiring wisdom brings life and health. The learning process involves two stages: (1) hearing the teachers words and treasuring them in the heart; (2) speaking and acting in accord with the wisdom that one has stored in ones heart. Seven organs of the body are mentioned: ear, eyes, heart, mouth, lips, eyelids (""gaze,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/25'>25</a>), feet. Each of the organs is to be strained to its limit as the disciple puts wisdom into practice. The physical organ stands for the faculty, e.g., the eye for sight, the foot for movement. The figure of speech is called metonymy; one word is substituted for another on the basis of a causal relation."
NABRE,20,4,24,"[7] 4:24-27 In vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/20'>20-21</a> the faculties of hearing (ear) and seeing (eye) take in the teaching and the heart stores and ponders it, so in the second half of the poem, vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/24'>24-27</a>, the faculties of speech, sight, and walking enable the disciple to put the teaching into practice."
NABRE,20,5,1,"[1] 5:1-23 This is the first of three poems on the forbidden woman, the ""stranger"" outside the social boundaries (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/2/16'>2:16-19</a>); the other two are <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a> and chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>. Understanding and discretion are necessary to avoid adultery, which leads astray and begets bitterness, bloodshed, and death (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>1-6</a>). It destroys honor, wastes the years of life, despoils hard-earned wealth, and brings remorse in the end (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/7'>7-14</a>). Conjugal fidelity and love bring happiness and security (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/15'>15-20</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/7/27'>7:27</a>. The structure of the poem consists of a two-line introduction; part one consists of three stanzas of four lines each warning of the forbidden womans effect on her lovers (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/3'>3-14</a>); part two consists of a stanza of twelve lines exhorting the disciple to marital fidelity (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/15'>15-20</a>); and a final stanza of six lines on the perils of the woman (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/21'>21-23</a>)."
NABRE,20,5,3,"[2] A metaphorical level is established in the opening description of the forbidden woman: her lips drip honey and her feet lead to death. By her lies, she leads people away from the wisdom that gives life."
NABRE,20,5,9,"[3] Honor: the words ""life"" and ""wealth"" have also been read in this place. A merciless one: the offended husband; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/34'>6:34-35</a>."
NABRE,20,5,15,"[4] 5:15-16 Water: water may have an erotic meaning as in <a href='/NABRE/22/4/15'>SON 4:15</a>, ""[You are] a garden fountain, a well of living water."" Eating and drinking can be metaphors expressing the mutuality of love. The wife is the opposite of the adulterous woman; she is not an outsider, not unfeeling, not a destroyer of her husbands self and goods. The best defense against adultery is appreciating and loving ones spouse. The best defense against folly is to appreciate and love wisdom."
NABRE,20,5,19,"[5] Lovely hind…graceful doe: ancient Near Eastern symbols of feminine beauty and charm; cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/2/7'>SON 2:7, 9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/22/2/17'>17</a>."
NABRE,20,6,1,"[1] 6:1-19 Four independent pieces akin to those in <a href='/NABRE/20/30/1'>30:1-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/30/6'>6-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/30/12'>12-15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/30/16'>16-19</a>. Some judge the verses to be an ancient addition, but the fact that the pieces differ from the other material in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9</a> is not a strong argument against their originality. Ancient anthologies did not always have the symmetry of modern collections. An editor may have placed the four pieces in the midst of the three poems on the forbidden woman to shed light on some of their themes. Verses 1-5 warn against getting trapped by ones words to another person (the Hebrew word for ""another"" is the same used for the forbidden woman); vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/6'>6-11</a> proposes the ant as a model of forethought and diligence; vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/12'>12-15</a> describes the reprobate who bears some similarity to the seductive woman, especially as portrayed in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>; vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/16'>16-19</a> depicts the typical enemy of God, underscoring the persons destructive words."
NABRE,20,6,1,"[2] 6:1-5 Unlike other instructions that begin with ""my son,"" this instruction does not urge the hearer to store up the fathers words as a means to wisdom, but only to avoid one practice—going surety for ones neighbor. The warning is intensified by repetition of ""neighbor"" and ""free yourself,"" the mention of bodily organs, and the imagery of hunting. Given your hand in pledge: lit., ""struck your hands""; this was probably the legal method for closing a contract. To become surety meant intervening in favor of the insolvent debtor and assuming responsibility for the payment of the debt, either by obtaining it from the debtor or substituting oneself. Proverbs is strongly opposed to the practice (<a href='/NABRE/20/11/15'>11:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/17/18'>17:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/20/16'>20:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/22/26'>22:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/27/13'>27:13</a>) apparently because of the danger it poses to the freedom of the one providing surety."
NABRE,20,6,6,"[3] 6:6-11 The sluggard or lazybones is a type in Proverbs, like the righteous and the wicked. Sometimes the opposite type to the sluggard is the diligent person. Other extended passages on the sluggard are <a href='/NABRE/20/24/30'>24:30-34</a> and <a href='/NABRE/20/26/13'>26:13-16</a>. The malice of the type is not low physical energy but the refusal to act. To describe human types, Proverbs often uses comparisons from the animal world, e.g., 27:8 (bird); 28:1, 15 (lion); 30:18-19 (eagle, snake); 30:24-28 (ant, badger, locust, lizard)."
NABRE,20,6,10,[4] This verse may be regarded as the sluggards reply or as a continuation of the remonstrance.
NABRE,20,6,12,"[5] 6:12-15 Proverbs uses types to make the point that certain ways of acting have inherent consequences. The typifying intensifies the picture. All the physical organs—mouth, eyes, feet, fingers—are at the service of evil. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/12'>ROM 6:12-13</a>: ""Therefore, sin must not reign over your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires. And do not present the parts of your bodies to sin as weapons for wickedness, but present yourselves to God as raised from the dead to life and the parts of your bodies to God as weapons of righteousness."""
NABRE,20,6,16,"[6] Six…seven: this literary pattern (n, n + 1) occurs frequently; cf., e.g., <a href='/NABRE/30/1/1'>AMO 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/30/2/1'>2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/30/18'>PRO 30:18-19</a>."
NABRE,20,6,17,"[7] 6:17-19 The seven vices, symbolized for the most part by bodily organs, are pride, lying, murder, intrigue, readiness to do evil, false witness, and the stirring up of discord."
NABRE,20,6,20,"[8] 6:20-35 The second of three instructions on adultery (<a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5:1-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a>; and chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>). The instructions assume that wisdom will protect one from adultery and its consequences: loss of property and danger to ones person. In this poem, the father and the mother urge their son to keep their teaching constantly before his eyes. The teaching will light his way and make it a path to life (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/23'>23</a>). The teaching will preserve him from the adulterous woman who is far more dangerous than a prostitute. Prostitutes may cost one money, but having an affair with someone elses wife puts one in grave danger. The poem bluntly urges self-interest as a motive to refrain from adultery. The poem has three parts. I (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>20-24</a>, ten lines), in which v. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/23'>23</a> repeats ""command"" and ""teaching"" of v. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>20</a> and ""keeping"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/24'>24</a> completes the fixed pair initiated by ""observe"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>20</a>; II (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/25'>25-29</a>, ten lines) is a self-contained argument comparing the costs of a liaison with a prostitute and a married woman; III (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/30'>30-35</a>, twelve lines) draws conclusions from the comparison of adultery with theft: the latter involves property only but adultery destroys ones name and very self. The best protection against such a woman is heeding parental instruction, which is to be kept vividly before ones eyes like a written tablet."
NABRE,20,6,22,"[9] They: Heb. has ""she."" If this verse is not out of place, then the antecedent of ""she"" is command (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>20</a>), or perhaps wisdom."
NABRE,20,6,27,"[10] 6:27-29 There is a play on three words of similar sound, îsh, ""man,"" ishshâ, ""woman,"" and ēsh, ""fire, embers."" The question, ""Can a man (îsh) take embers (ēsh) into his bosom / and his garments not be burned?"", has a double meaning. ""Into his bosom"" has an erotic meaning as in the phrase ""wife of ones bosom"" (<a href='/NABRE/5/13/6'>DEU 13:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/28/54'>28:54</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/9/1'>SIR 9:1</a>). Hence one will destroy ones garments, which symbolize ones public position, by taking fire/anothers wife into ones bosom."
NABRE,20,6,33,"[11] 6:33-35 The nature of the husbands vengeance is disputed, some believing it is simply a physical beating whereas others hold it is public and involves the death penalty because <a href='/NABRE/3/20/20'>LEV 20:20</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/22/22'>DEU 22:22</a> demand the death penalty."
NABRE,20,7,1,"[1] 7:1-27 The third and climactic instruction on adultery and seduction is an example story, of the same type as the example story in <a href='/NABRE/20/24/30'>24:30-34</a>. By its negative portrayal of the deceitful woman, who speaks in the night to a lone youth, it serves as a foil to trustworthy Wisdom in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/1'>8</a>, who speaks in broad daylight to all who pass in the street. As motivation, the father in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/6'>6-23</a> tells his son of an incident he once observed while looking out his window—a young man went to the bed of an adulterous woman and wound up dead. As in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5</a>, the realistic details—the purposeful woman, the silent youth, the vow, the perfumed bed—have a metaphorical level. Ultimately the story is about two different kinds of love."
NABRE,20,7,1,"[2] 7:1-3 Verses 1-3 are artistically constructed. ""Keep"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>1a</a> recurs in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/2'>2a</a>; ""commands"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>1</a>b recurs in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/2'>2</a>a; the imperative verb ""live"" occurs in the very center of the three lines; v. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/3'>3</a>, on preserving the teaching upon ones very person, matches vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>1-2</a>, on preserving the teaching internally by memorizing it."
NABRE,20,7,2,"[3] Live: here as elsewhere (<a href='/NABRE/1/20/7'>GEN 20:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/42/18'>42:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/18/32'>2KG 18:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/27/12'>JER 27:12, 17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/18/32'>EZE 18:32</a>), the imperative (""Live!"") is uttered against the danger of death, e.g., ""Do such and such and you will live (= survive the danger); why should you die?"""
NABRE,20,7,4,"[4] You are my sister: ""sister"" and ""brother"" are examples of love language in the ancient Near East, occurring in Egyptian love poetry and Mesopotamian marriage songs. In <a href='/NABRE/22/4/9'>SON 4:9, 10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/22/4/12'>12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/5/1'>5:1</a>, the man calls the woman, ""my sister, my bride."" Intimate friendship with Woman Wisdom saves one from false and dangerous relationships."
NABRE,20,7,6,[5] 7:6-7 I looked out…I saw…: the perspective is unusual. The narrator looks through a window upon the drama in the street.
NABRE,20,7,17,"[6] Bed: a bed can designate a place of burial in <a href='/NABRE/23/57/2'>ISA 57:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/32/25'>EZE 32:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/16/14'>2CH 16:14</a>. Myrrh…aloes: the spices could be used for funerals as for weddings (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/39'>JHN 19:39</a>). It is possible that the language is ambivalent, speaking of death as it seems to speak of life. As the woman offers the youth a nuptial feast, she is in reality describing his funerary feast."
NABRE,20,7,19,[7] 7:19-20 For my husband is not at home: the woman is calculating. She knows exactly how long her husband will be gone.
NABRE,20,7,21,"[8] The verbs ""to win over"" (lit., ""to lead astray"") and ""to lead off"" can be used of leading animals such as a donkey (<a href='/NABRE/4/22/23'>NUM 22:23</a>) or sheep (<a href='/NABRE/24/23/2'>JER 23:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/50/17'>50:17</a>). The animal imagery continues as the youth is compared to an ox, a fallow deer, and a bird in the moment they are slaughtered. None of the animals are aware of their impending death."
NABRE,20,7,24,"[9] 7:24-27 The father addresses ""children,"" a larger audience than his own son; the story is typical, intended for others as an example. The story is a foil to the speech of the other woman in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/1'>8</a>."
NABRE,20,8,1,"[1] 8:1-36 Chapter 8 is Wisdoms longest speech in the book. Wisdom is here personified as in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/20'>1:20-33</a>. She exalts her grandeur and origin, and invites all (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/1'>1-11</a>) to be attentive to her salutary influence in human society (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/12'>12-21</a>), for she was privileged to be present at the creation of the world (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>22-31</a>). Finally, she promises life and the favor of God to those who are devoted to her, death to those who reject her. Chapter 8 is the best-known chapter in Proverbs and has profoundly influenced Jewish and Christian thought. The most explicit and lengthy biblical comment is in Sir 24; it too has thirty-five lines in seven five-line stanzas and develops the theme of Wisdoms intimacy with God and desire to be with human beings. The Gospel of John portrays Jesus in the language of wisdom in Proverbs: Jesus, like Wisdom, calls out to people to listen to him, promises to tell them the truth, seeks disciples, invites them to a banquet, and gives them life. Writers in the patristic period used the language of pre-existent wisdom to express the idea of the pre-existent Word with God."
NABRE,20,8,5,[2] Naive ones…fools: see note on <a href='/NABRE/20/1/4'>1:4</a>.
NABRE,20,8,7,"[3] 8:7-8 The truth and sincerity of wisdom are absolute because they are of divine origin. They can neither deceive nor tolerate deception. The intelligent understand and accept this. ""Straight"" and ""crooked"" in Hebrew and English are metaphors for true, trustworthy and false, deceitful."
NABRE,20,8,14,[4] What is here predicated of Wisdom is elsewhere attributed to God (<a href='/NABRE/18/12/13'>JOB 12:13-16</a>).
NABRE,20,8,22,"[5] 8:22-31 Wisdom is of divine origin. She is represented as existing before all things (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>22-26</a>), when God planned and created the universe, adorning it with beauty and variety, and establishing its wonderful order (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/27'>27-30</a>). The purpose of the two cosmogonies (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>22-26</a> and <a href='/NABRE/20/8/27'>27-31</a>) is to ground Wisdoms claims. The first cosmogony emphasizes that she was born before all else (and so deserving of honor) and the second underscores that she was with the Lord during the creation of the universe. The pre-existence of Woman Wisdom with God is developed in Sir 24 and in New Testament hymns to Christ, especially in <a href='/NABRE/43/1/1'>JHN 1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/51/1/15'>COL 1:15-20</a>."
NABRE,20,8,23,"[6] Formed: since the other verbs of the origin of Wisdom in these verses describe birth, it is likely that the somewhat uncertain verb is to be understood of birth as in <a href='/NABRE/19/139/13'>PS 139:13</a>."
NABRE,20,8,24,[7] 8:24-26 Perhaps the formless mass from which God created the heavens and the earth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>GEN 1:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/2/4'>2:4-6</a>.
NABRE,20,8,30,"[8] Artisan: the translation of the Hebrew word āmônhas been controverted since antiquity. There have been three main opinions: (1) artisan; (2) trustworthy (friend); (3) ward, nursling. The most likely explanation is that āmônis artisan, related to Akkadian ummānu, legendary sages and heroes who brought divine gifts and culture to the human race. I was his delight: the chiastic or ABBA structure of vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/30'>30-31</a> unifies the four lines and underscores the analogy between Woman Wisdoms intimate relation to the Lord and her intimate relation to human beings, i.e., ""delight"" + ""playing"" parallels ""playing"" + ""delight."" She is Gods friend and intimate and invites human beings to a similar relationship to God through her."
NABRE,20,8,32,[9] 8:32-36 The final appeal of Woman Wisdom to her disciples is similar to the appeal of the father in <a href='/NABRE/20/7/24'>7:24-27</a>.
NABRE,20,9,1,"[1] 9:1-6, 13-18 Wisdom and folly are represented as women, each inviting people to her banquet. Wisdoms banquet symbolizes joy and closeness to God. Unstable and senseless Folly furnishes stolen bread and water of deceit and vice that bring death to her guests. The opposition between wisdom and folly was stated at the beginning of chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9</a> (folly in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>1:8-19</a> and wisdom in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/20'>1:20-33</a>) and is maintained throughout, down to this last chapter. Verses 7-12 are unrelated to the two invitations to the banquet. They appear to be based on chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1</a>, especially on <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1:1-7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/1/22'>22</a>. The Greek version has added a number of verses after v. <a href='/NABRE/20/9/12'>12</a> and v. <a href='/NABRE/20/9/18'>18</a>. In the confusion, 9:11 seems to have been displaced from its original position after <a href='/NABRE/20/9/6'>9:6</a>. It has been restored to its original place in the text."
NABRE,20,9,1,"[2] House: house has a symbolic meaning. Woman Wisdom encourages marital fidelity (<a href='/NABRE/20/2/16'>2:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a>; 7), which builds up a household (cf. chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5</a>). Some scholars propose that an actual seven-pillared house is referred to, but so far none have been unearthed by archaeologists. Seven may simply connote completeness—a great house. Some scholars see a connection between the womans house here and the womans house in the final poem (<a href='/NABRE/20/31/10'>31:10-31</a>). In chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9</a>, she invites the young man to enter her house and feast, i.e., to marry her. Chapter 31 shows what happens to the man who marries her; he has a house and enjoys ""life"" understood as consisting of a suitable wife, children, wealth, and honor."
NABRE,20,9,3,"[3] She calls: i.e., invites; this is done indirectly through her maidservants, but the text could also mean that Wisdom herself publicly proclaims her invitation."
NABRE,20,9,6,"[4] That you may live: life in Proverbs is this-worldly, consisting in fearing God or doing ones duty toward God, enjoying health and long life, possessing wealth, good reputation, and a family. Such a life cannot be attained without Gods help. Hence Wisdom speaks not of life simply but of life with her; the guest is to live in Wisdoms house."
NABRE,20,9,13,"[5] 9:13-18 Woman Folly is the mirror image of Woman Wisdom. Both make identical invitations but only one of the offers is trustworthy. Their hearers must discern which is the true offer. She is depicted with traits of the adulterous woman in <a href='/NABRE/20/2/16'>2:16-19</a>; chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/1'>5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20-35</a>; chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>. Woman Folly is restless (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/11'>7:11</a>), her path leads to the underworld (<a href='/NABRE/20/2/18'>2:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/5/5'>5:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/7/27'>7:27</a>), and she is ignorant (<a href='/NABRE/20/5/6'>5:6</a>). In this final scene, she appears in single combat with her great nemesis, Woman Wisdom. Though the invitations of the two women appear at first hearing to be the same, they differ profoundly. Wisdom demands that her guests reject their ignorance, whereas Woman Folly trades on their ignorance."
NABRE,20,9,17,"[6] ""Stolen water"" seems to refer to adultery, for ""water"" in <a href='/NABRE/20/5/15'>5:15-17</a> refers to the wifes sexuality; ""stolen"" refers to stealing the sexuality belonging to anothers household. ""Secret"" evokes the furtive meeting of the wife and the youth in chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>."
NABRE,20,9,18,"[7] The banquet chamber of Folly is a tomb from which no one who enters it is released; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/27'>7:27</a>. Shades: the Rephaim, the inhabitants of the underworld."
NABRE,20,10,1,"[1] 10:1-22:16 The Proverbs of Solomon are a collection of three hundred and seventy-five proverbs on a wide variety of subjects. No overall arrangement is discernible, but there are many clusters of sayings related by vocabulary and theme. One thread running through the whole is the relationship of the ""son,"" the disciple, to the parents, and its effect upon the house(hold). In chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/10/1'>10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/14/1'>14</a> almost all the proverbs are antithetical; ""the righteous"" and ""the wicked"" (ethical), ""the wise"" and ""the foolish"" (sapiential), and ""the devout, the pious"" and ""the irreverent"" (religious). Chapters 15-22 have fewer sharp antitheses. The sayings are generally witty, often indirect, and are rich in irony and paradox."
NABRE,20,10,1,"[2] The opening saying ties the whole collection to the first section, for ""son,"" ""father,"" and ""mother"" evoke the opening line of the first instruction, ""Hear, my son, your fathers instruction, and reject not your mothers teaching."" The son is the subject of parental exhortation throughout chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9</a>. This is the first of many sayings on domestic happiness or unhappiness, between parents and children (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/20/15/20'>15:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/17/21'>17:21</a>) and between husband and wife (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/20/12/4'>12:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/14/1'>14:1</a>). Founding or maintaining a household is an important metaphor in the book. Adult children represented the family (headed by the oldest married male) to the outside world. Foolishness, i.e., malicious ignorance, brought dishonor to the parents and the family."
NABRE,20,10,2,"[3] Death: untimely, premature, or sorrowful. The word ""death"" can have other overtones (see <a href='/NABRE/70/1/15'>WIS 1:15</a>)."
NABRE,20,10,3,"[4] The last of the three introductory sayings in the collection, which emphasize, respectively, the sapiential (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/10/1'>1</a>), ethical (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/10/2'>2</a>), and religious (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/10/3'>3</a>) dimensions of wisdom. In this saying, God will not allow the appetite of the righteous to go unfulfilled. The appetite of hunger is singled out; it stands for all the appetites."
NABRE,20,10,6,"[5] This saying, like several others in the chapter, plays on the different senses of the verb ""to cover."" As in English, ""to cover"" can mean to fill (as in <a href='/NABRE/23/60/2'>ISA 60:2</a>) and to conceal (as in <a href='/NABRE/18/16/18'>JOB 16:18</a>). Colon B can be read either ""violence fillsthe mouth (= head) of the wicked"" or ""the mouth of the wicked concealsviolence."" The ambiguity is intentional; the proverb is meant to be read both ways."
NABRE,20,10,7,"[6] The name of the righteous continues to be used after their death in blessings such as ""May you be as blessed as Abraham,"" but the wicked, being enemies of God, do not live on in anyones memory. Their names rot with their bodies."
NABRE,20,10,8,[7] The wise take in instruction from their teachers but those who expel or pour out folly through their words will themselves be expelled.
NABRE,20,10,12,[8] Love covers all offenses: a favorite maxim in the New Testament; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/13/7'>1CO 13:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/59/5/20'>JAM 5:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/4/8'>1PE 4:8</a>. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/20/17/9'>PRO 17:9</a>.
NABRE,20,10,13,"[9] An unusual juxtaposition of ""lips"" and ""back."" Those who have no wisdom on their lips (words) are fated to feel a punishing rod on their back."
NABRE,20,10,15,[10] An observation rather than a moral evaluation of wealth and poverty; but cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/18/10'>18:10-11</a>.
NABRE,20,10,16,"[11] Wages are a metaphor for reward and punishment. The Hebrew word does not mean ""sin"" here but falling short, a meaning that is frequent in Proverbs. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>ROM 6:1</a>: ""But what profit did you get then from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death."""
NABRE,20,10,21,[12] The wise by their words maintain others in life whereas the foolish cannot keep themselves from sin that leads to premature death.
NABRE,20,10,22,[13] Human industry is futile without divine approval; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/127/1'>PS 127:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/6/25'>MAT 6:25-34</a>.
NABRE,20,10,28,"[14] The thought is elliptical. Joy comes from fulfillment of ones plans, which the righteous can count on. The opposite of joy thus is not sadness but unfulfillment (""perishes"")."
NABRE,20,10,32,"[15] The word used for ""favor"" is favor shown by an authority (God or the king), not favor shown by a peer. A righteous persons words create a climate of favor and acceptance, whereas crooked words will not gain acceptance. In Hebrew as in English, straight and crooked are metaphors for good and wicked."
NABRE,20,11,1,"[1] The word pair ""abomination"" and ""delight"" (= acceptable) to God is common in Proverbs. Originally the language of ritual, the words came to be applied to whatever pleases or displeases God (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/20/11/20'>11:20</a>). False weights were a constant problem even though weights were standardized. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/20/23'>20:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/12/8'>HOS 12:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/8/5'>AMO 8:5</a>."
NABRE,20,11,2,[2] Disgrace is the very opposite of what the proud so ardently want. Those who do not demand their due receive wisdom.
NABRE,20,11,4,"[3] Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/20/10/2'>10:2</a>. A day of wrath is an unforeseen disaster (even death). Only ones relationship to God, which makes one righteous, is of any help on such a day."
NABRE,20,11,5,"[4] In Hebrew as in English, ""way"" means the course of ones life; similarly, ""straight"" and ""crooked"" are metaphors for morally straightforward and for bad, deviant, perverted."
NABRE,20,11,7,"[5] An ancient scribe added ""wicked"" to person in colon A, for the statement that hope ends at death seemed to deny life after death. The saying, however, is not concerned with life after death but with the fact that in the face of death all hopes based on ones own resources are vain. The aphorism is the climax of the preceding six verses; human resources cannot overcome mortality (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/49/13'>PS 49:13</a>)."
NABRE,20,11,9,"[6] What the wicked express harms others; what the righteous leave unsaid protects. Verses 9-14 are related in theme: the effect of good and bad people, especially their words, on their community."
NABRE,20,11,15,[7] Proverbs is opposed to providing surety for anothers loan (see note on <a href='/NABRE/20/6/1'>6:1-5</a>) and expresses this view throughout the book.
NABRE,20,11,16,"[8] Wealth and esteem are good things in Proverbs, but the means for acquiring them are flawed. As precious gifts, they must be granted, not taken. The esteem of others that depends on beauty is as fleeting as beauty itself (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/30'>31:30</a>) and the wealth acquired by aggressive behavior lasts only as long as one has physical strength."
NABRE,20,11,20,"[9] The terminology of ritual (acceptable and unacceptable sacrifice, ""abomination"" and ""delight"") is applied to human conduct as in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/11/1'>1</a>. The whole of human life is under divine scrutiny, not just ritual."
NABRE,20,11,22,[10] Ear and nose rings were common jewelry for women. A humorous saying on the priority of wisdom over beauty in choosing a wife.
NABRE,20,11,24,[11] A paradox: spending leads to more wealth.
NABRE,20,11,27,[12] The saying is about seeking one thing and finding another. Striving for good leads to acceptance by God; seeking evil means only that trouble will come. The same Hebrew word means evil and trouble.
NABRE,20,11,30,"[13] Most translations emend Hebrew ""wise person"" in colon B on the basis of the Greek and Syriac translations to ""violence"" (similar in spelling), because the verb ""to take a life"" is a Hebrew idiom for ""to kill"" (as also in English). The emendation is unnecessary, however, for the saying deliberately plays on the odd meaning: the one who takes lives is not the violent but the wise person, for the wise have a profound influence upon life. There is a similar wordplay in <a href='/NABRE/20/29/10'>29:10</a>."
NABRE,20,11,31,"[14] The saying is not about life after death; ""on the earth"" means life in the present world. The meaning is that divine judgment is exercised on all human action, even the best. The thought should strike terror into the hearts of habitual wrongdoers."
NABRE,20,12,1,"[1] Discipline in Proverbs is both doctrine and training. The path to wisdom includes obedience to teachers and parents, acceptance of the communitys traditions."
NABRE,20,12,2,"[2] The antithesis is between the good person who, by reason of that goodness, already has divine acceptance, and the wicked person who, despite great effort, gains only condemnation."
NABRE,20,12,3,"[3] Human beings are described as ""made secure"" in <a href='/NABRE/18/21/8'>JOB 21:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/101/7'>PS 101:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/102/29'>102:29</a>. ""Root"" in the context means enduring to succeeding generations, as in <a href='/NABRE/39/3/19'>MAL 3:19</a> and <a href='/NABRE/18/8/17'>JOB 8:17</a>."
NABRE,20,12,4,"[4] In Proverbs a crown is the result and sign of wise conduct. A good wife is a public sign of the husbands shrewd judgment and divine blessing (crown), whereas a bad wife brings him inner pain (rot in the bones)."
NABRE,20,12,5,"[5] The opposite of ""just"" is not injustice but ""deceit."" The wicked will be deceived in their plans in the sense that their planning will not succeed."
NABRE,20,12,6,[6] Words are a favorite theme of Proverbs. The words of the wicked effect harm to others whereas the words of the righteous protect themselves.
NABRE,20,12,8,"[7] The heart, the seat of intelligence, will eventually be revealed in the actions that people do, either for praise or for blame."
NABRE,20,12,10,[8] The righteous are sympathetically aware of the needs of their livestock and prosper from their herds good health. The wicked will pay the price for their self-centeredness and cruelty.
NABRE,20,12,11,"[9] The second line clarifies the first: idleness will give one plenty of nothing. ""Lacking sense"" is a common phrase for fools."
NABRE,20,12,12,"[10] A difficult, possibly corrupt saying, but there is no good alternative to the Hebrew text. The wicked desire what the malevolent have captured or killed, but their actions will go for naught because they invite punishment. The righteous, on the other hand, will bear fruit."
NABRE,20,12,14,"[11] The saying contrasts words and deeds. ""Fruit"" here is not what one normally eats, as in <a href='/NABRE/20/1/31'>1:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/8/19'>8:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/31/16'>31:16, 31</a>, but the consequences of ones actions. In the second line the things that issue from ones hands (ones deeds) come back to one in recompense or punishment. <a href='/NABRE/20/13/2'>PRO 13:2</a>a and <a href='/NABRE/20/18/20'>18:20</a> are variants. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/7/17'>MAT 7:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/6/8'>GAL 6:8</a>."
NABRE,20,12,17,[12] What is the rule of thumb for judging legal testimony? Look to the ordinary conduct and daily speech of a witness.
NABRE,20,12,19,"[13] The saying has a double meaning: lies are quickly found out whereas truthful statements endure; truth-tellers, being favored by God, live long lives, whereas liars invite punishment."
NABRE,20,12,23,"[14] ""Knowledge"" here is ""what one knows, has in ones heart,"" not knowledge in general. Fools reveal all they have stored in their heart and it naturally turns out to be folly. Revealing and concealing are constant themes in Proverbs."
NABRE,20,13,1,"[1] Another in the series on the household, this one on the relation of parents and children. See under <a href='/NABRE/20/10/1'>10:1</a>. The scoffer in Proverbs condemns discipline and thus can never become wise. Wise adult children advertise to the community what they received from their parents, for children become wise through a dialectical process involving the parents. A foolish adult child witnesses to foolish parents."
NABRE,20,13,2,"[2] Ones mouth normally eats food from outside, but in the moral life, things are reversed: one eats from the fruit of ones mouth, i.e., one experiences the consequences of ones own actions. Since the mouth of the treacherous is filled with violence, one must assume that they will some day endure violence."
NABRE,20,13,3,"[3] Preserve themselves: in Hebrew, literally to preserve the throat area, the moist breathing center of ones body, thus ""life,"" ""soul,"" or ""self."" There is wordplay: if you guard your mouth (= words) you guard your ""soul."" Fools, on the other hand, do not guard but open their lips and disaster strikes. A near duplicate is <a href='/NABRE/20/21/23'>21:23</a>."
NABRE,20,13,7,[4] Appearances can be deceiving; possessions do not always reveal the true state of a person.
NABRE,20,13,8,"[5] Related to v. <a href='/NABRE/20/13/7'>7</a>. Possessions enable the wealthy to pay ransom but the poor are ""protected"" by lack of possessions: they never hear the threat of the pursuer. Cf. the use of the word ""threat"" in <a href='/NABRE/23/30/17'>ISA 30:17</a>."
NABRE,20,13,9,[6] Light…lamp: symbols of life and prosperity; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/4/18'>4:18-19</a>.
NABRE,20,13,12,"[7] ""Tree of life"" occurs in <a href='/NABRE/1/2/1'>GEN 2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/3/18'>PRO 3:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/11/30'>11:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/13/12'>13:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/15/4'>15:4</a>, and <a href='/NABRE/66/2/7'>REV 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/22/2'>22:2, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/66/22/19'>19</a>. It provides food and healing."
NABRE,20,13,13,"[8] Must pay for it: lit., ""is pledge to it,"" i.e., just as one who has pledged or provided surety for anothers loan is obligated to that pledge, so one is not free of a command until one performs it."
NABRE,20,13,15,"[9] As the behavior of the wise wins them favor that increases their prosperity, like Abigail with David in <a href='/NABRE/9/25/1'>1SM 25</a>, so the way (= conduct) of the faithless ruins their lives."
NABRE,20,13,16,"[10] Like <a href='/NABRE/20/12/23'>12:23</a> and <a href='/NABRE/20/15/2'>15:2, 3</a>, the saying is about revealing and concealing. The wise reveal their wisdom in their actions whereas fools ""parade,"" spread out their folly for all to see. The verb is used of vendors spreading their wares and of birds spreading their wings."
NABRE,20,13,18,"[11] The saying plays on letting go and holding on. Wisdom consists in not rejecting discipline and being open to the comments of others, even if they are reproving comments."
NABRE,20,13,23,"[12] An observation on the poor. The lands of the poor are as fertile as anyones, for nature does not discriminate against them. Their problem is lack of justice, which puts their harvest at risk from unscrupulous human beings."
NABRE,20,14,1,"[1] The relationship between Wisdom, personified as a woman, and building a house is a constant theme. As elsewhere, the book here warns against the wrong woman and praises the right woman."
NABRE,20,14,4,"[2] If one has no animals, one does not have the burden of keeping the crib full, but without them one will have no crops to fill the barn. Colon B reverses the sense of colon A and also reverses the consonants of bar(""clean"") to rab(""abundant"")."
NABRE,20,14,5,[3] On discerning the truthfulness of witnesses; see <a href='/NABRE/20/12/17'>12:17</a>.
NABRE,20,14,8,"[4] Wisdom enables the shrewd to know their path is right but folly leads fools on the wrong path (""deceit""), which calls down retribution."
NABRE,20,14,10,[5] The heart in Proverbs is where a persons sense impressions are stored and reflected upon. It is thus ones most personal and individual part. Ones sorrows and joys (= the full range of emotions) cannot be shared fully with another. Verse 13 expresses the same individuality of the human person.
NABRE,20,14,11,"[6] The traditional fixed pair ""house"" and ""tent"" is used to express the paradox that a house can be less secure than a tent if there is no justice."
NABRE,20,14,15,[7] The naive gullibly rely on others words whereas the shrewd watch their own steps.
NABRE,20,14,18,"[8] The inner quality of a person, simple or wise, will eventually be revealed."
NABRE,20,14,21,"[9] The paradox is that anyone who spurns the hungry will lack something, but anyone who shows mercy (presumably by giving to the poor) will gain prosperity."
NABRE,20,14,29,"[10] A series of puns on short and long; lit., ""long of nostrils (idiom for ""patient""), large in wisdom, / short in breath (idiom for ""impatient""), makes folly tall."""
NABRE,20,14,33,"[11] Wisdom can remain silent in a wise person as a welcome friend. But it must speak out among fools, for the dissonance is so strong."
NABRE,20,14,34,"[12] The rare noun ""disgrace"" occurs elsewhere only in <a href='/NABRE/3/20/17'>LEV 20:17</a>. In measuring the greatness of a nation, one is tempted to consider territory, wealth, history, but the most important criterion is its relationship to God (""justice"")."
NABRE,20,15,1,[1] 15:1-7 These verses form a section beginning and ending with the topic of words.
NABRE,20,15,1,"[2] Paradoxically, where words are concerned soft is powerful and hard is ineffective."
NABRE,20,15,5,[3] One becomes wise by keeping and foolish by rejecting. One must accept the tradition of the community.
NABRE,20,15,7,"[4] ""Lips"" and ""heart"" are a fixed pair, in Proverbs signifying, respectively, expression and source. The wise disseminate what they have in their heart, but the wicked are unsound even in the source of their words, their hearts."
NABRE,20,15,10,"[5] Discipline, always a good thing in Proverbs, seems bad to those deliberately wandering from justice."
NABRE,20,15,11,"[6] Sheol and Abaddon: terms for the abode of the dead, signifying the profound obscurity which is open nevertheless to the sight and power of God; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/27/20'>27:20</a>."
NABRE,20,15,14,"[7] The contrasts include heart (organ of reflection) and mouth (organ of expression), and the wise and fools. One type feeds its mind with wisdom and the other feeds its face with folly."
NABRE,20,15,15,[8] Good heart does not refer to good intentions but to an instructed mind. Wisdom makes poverty not only bearable but even joyful like the joy of feast days.
NABRE,20,15,16,[9] 15:16-17 The sages favor wealth over poverty—but not at any price; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/37/16'>PS 37:16</a>.
NABRE,20,15,21,"[10] The word ""joy"" occurs in the first line of vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/15/20'>20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/15/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/15/23'>23</a>. The state of folly is joy to a fool but the wise person is totally absorbed in keeping on the right or straight road."
NABRE,20,15,22,"[11] Failure to consult makes it likely a plan will not succeed. The point is nicely made by contrasting the singular number in the first line (""no counsel"") with the plural number in the second line (""many advisors"")."
NABRE,20,15,23,[12] Conversation is the art of saying the right thing at the right time. It gives pleasure to speaker and hearer alike.
NABRE,20,15,24,"[13] Death is personified as Sheol, the underworld. ""Up"" and ""down"" in Hebrew as in English are metaphors for success and failure (see <a href='/NABRE/5/28/43'>DEU 28:43</a>). One who stays on the path of life need not fear the punishment that stalks sinners."
NABRE,20,15,26,"[14] ""Pure"" here means acceptable. The language of ritual (acceptable or pure) is applied to ordinary human actions. ""Gracious words"" are words that bring peace to the neighbor."
NABRE,20,15,27,[15] The same lesson as the opening scene of Proverbs (<a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>1:8-19</a>): one cannot build a house by unjust gain. Injustice will come back upon a house so built.
NABRE,20,15,31,"[16] To become wise, one must hear and integrate perspectives contrary to ones own, which means accepting ""reproof."" Wisdom does not isolate one but places one in the company of the wise."
NABRE,20,16,1,"[1] Words, like actions, often produce results different from those which were planned, and this comes under the agency of God."
NABRE,20,16,2,"[2] ""Pure"" in a moral sense for human action is found only in Job and Proverbs. As in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/16/1'>1</a>, the contrast is between human intent and divine assessment."
NABRE,20,16,4,[3] Even the wicked do not lie outside Gods plan.
NABRE,20,16,5,"[4] Proud heart: lit., ""high of heart."" To forget one is a fallible human being is so basic an error that one cannot escape exposure and punishment."
NABRE,20,16,6,"[5] As v. <a href='/NABRE/20/16/5'>5</a> used the language of worship to express what is acceptable or not to God, so this saying uses similar language to declare that lovingly loyal conduct undoes the effects of sin."
NABRE,20,16,9,"[6] As in vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/16/1'>1-3</a>, the antithesis is between human plans and divine disposal. The saying uses the familiar metaphor of path for the course of life."
NABRE,20,16,10,"[7] Six sayings on the king and his divine authority begin here, following the series of sayings about the Lords governance in <a href='/NABRE/20/15/33'>15:33</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/16/9'>16:9</a>, in which ""Lord"" was mentioned nine times."
NABRE,20,16,15,"[8] The last of six sayings about the king. In the previous verse, royal wrath means death; in this verse royal favor means life. It is significant that royal favor is compared to something not under human control—the clouds preceding the spring rains."
NABRE,20,16,16,"[9] The point of comparison is the superiority of the pursuit of wisdom and gold, not the relative merits of wealth and wisdom."
NABRE,20,16,17,"[10] In the metaphor of the two ways, the way of the righteous is protected and the way of the wicked is unprotected. Since the path of the righteous leads therefore away from trouble, ones task is to stay on it, to ""attend to"" it."
NABRE,20,16,26,"[11] The adage puzzled ancient and modern commentators. The meaning seems to state the paradox that a person does not toil to feed the gullet but that the gullet itself ""toils"" in the sense that it forces the person to work. As often in Proverbs, the sense organ stands for the faculty by metonymy. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/21/6/7'>ECC 6:7</a>."
NABRE,20,16,30,[12] A restless or twitching eye or lip betrays the condition of the heart (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/13'>6:13</a>).
NABRE,20,16,33,"[13] Dice were given meanings of ""yes"" or ""no"" and then cast for their answer. What came out was the decision. Here the saying interprets the sequence of actions: a human being puts the dice in the bag but what emerges from the bag is the Lords decision."
NABRE,20,17,1,"[1] A ""better than"" saying, stating the circumstances when a dry crust is better than a banquet. Peace and fellowship give joy to a meal, not the richness of the food. For a similar thought, see <a href='/NABRE/20/15/16'>15:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/16/8'>16:8</a>."
NABRE,20,17,2,[2] Ability is esteemed more highly than ties of blood.
NABRE,20,17,8,"[3] An observation on the effect of the bribe upon the bribe-giver: it gives an intoxicating feeling of power (""seems""). In v. <a href='/NABRE/20/17/23'>23</a> the evil effects of a bribe are noted."
NABRE,20,17,9,"[4] A paradox. One finds (love, friend) by concealing (an offense), one loses (a friend) by revealing (a secret). In <a href='/NABRE/20/10/12'>10:12</a> love also covers over a multitude of offenses."
NABRE,20,17,10,[5] A wonderful comment on the openness and sensitivity of the wise and the foolish. One type learns from a single word and for the other one hundred blows are not enough.
NABRE,20,17,11,[6] The irony is that such people will meet up with what they so energetically pursue—in the form of an unrelenting emissary sent to them.
NABRE,20,17,12,[7] Humorous hyperbole. An outraged dangerous beast poses less danger than a fool.
NABRE,20,17,13,[8] The paradox is that to pay out evil for good means that the evil will never leave ones own house.
NABRE,20,17,16,"[9] The exhortation to acquire or purchase wisdom is common in Proverbs. Fools misunderstand the metaphor, assuming they can buy it with money. Their very misunderstanding shows they have no ""heart"" = mind, understanding. Money in the hand is no good without such a ""heart"" to store it in."
NABRE,20,17,19,[10] Build their gate high: a symbol of arrogance.
NABRE,20,17,20,"[11] The saying employs the familiar metaphors of walking = conducting oneself (""fall into trouble""), and of straight and crooked = right and wrong (""perverse,"" ""double-tongued"")."
NABRE,20,17,23,[12] A sharp look at the sly withdrawing of a bribe from the pocket and a blunt judgment on its significance.
NABRE,20,17,24,"[13] Wisdom is visible on the countenance (i.e., mouth, lips, tongue) of the wise person; its ultimate source is the heart. Fools have no such source of wisdom within them, a point that is nicely made by referring to the eye of the fool, roving over the landscape."
NABRE,20,17,28,"[14] Related to v. <a href='/NABRE/20/17/27'>27</a>. Words provide a glimpse into the heart. In the unlikely event that fools, who usually pour out words (<a href='/NABRE/20/15/2'>15:2</a>), were to say nothing, people would not be able to see their folly and would presume them intelligent. Alas, the saying is contrary to fact."
NABRE,20,18,2,"[1] One grows in wisdom by listening to others, but fools take delight in expounding the contents of their minds."
NABRE,20,18,4,"[2] Words express a persons thoughts (""deep waters""), which in turn become accessible to others. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/20/5'>20:5</a>a."
NABRE,20,18,6,"[3] The bold personification of lips and mouth is similar to <a href='/NABRE/19/73/9'>PS 73:9</a>, ""They set their mouths against the heavens, their tongues roam the earth."" Careless words can lead one into serious trouble."
NABRE,20,18,10,[4] 18:10-11 Contrast this judgment with the observation in <a href='/NABRE/20/10/15'>10:15</a>.
NABRE,20,18,13,[5] To speak without first listening is characteristic of a fool; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/10/14'>10:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/11/8'>SIR 11:8</a>.
NABRE,20,18,14,"[6] The paradox is that something as slight as a column of air offers protection against the encroachment of death. If it is stilled, nothing, no matter how powerful, can substitute for it."
NABRE,20,18,15,"[7] ""Knowledge"" here refers to what one knows, not knowledge in itself. The mind acquires and stores it, the ear strains toward it."
NABRE,20,18,17,"[8] A persuasive speech in court can easily make one forget there is another side to the question. When the other party speaks, people realize they made a premature judgment. The experience at court is a lesson for daily life: there are two sides to every question."
NABRE,20,18,18,[9] See note on <a href='/NABRE/20/16/33'>16:33</a>.
NABRE,20,18,19,"[10] The Greek version, followed by several ancient versions, has the opposite meaning: ""A brother helped by a brother is like a strong and lofty city; it is strong like a well-founded palace."" The Greek is secondary as is shown by the need to supply the phrase ""by a brother""; further, the parallelism is inadequate. The Hebrew is to be preferred."
NABRE,20,18,20,"[11] Fruit from the earth is our ordinary sustenance, but ""the fruit of ones lips,"" i.e., our words, also affect our well-being. If our words and our deeds are right, then we are blessed, our ""belly is filled."""
NABRE,20,18,21,"[12] This enigmatic saying has provoked many interpretations, e.g., judicious speech brings a reward; those who love the tongue in the sense of rattling on must face the consequences of their loquacity. This translation interprets the verb ""love"" in colon B in its occasional sense of ""choose"" (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/20/12/1'>12:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/20/13'>20:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/37'>DEU 4:37</a>) and interprets its pronominal object as referring to both death and life in colon A. Death and life are set before every person (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/30/15'>DEU 30:15-20</a>) and we have the power to choose either one by the quality of our deeds. Words (= ""the tongue"") are regarded here as the defining actions of human beings."
NABRE,20,19,2,"[1] When not guided by wisdom, appetite—or desire—is not good. ""Running feet"" (so the Hebrew) miss the mark, i.e., do not reach their destination."
NABRE,20,19,3,[2] Ones own folly destroys ones life. It is an indication of that folly that one blames God rather than oneself.
NABRE,20,19,5,[3] The punishment fits the crime: those who abuse the legal system will be punished by the same system. They will not be acquitted.
NABRE,20,19,7,"[4] Closely related to vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/19/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/19/6'>6</a>. An observation, not without sympathy, on the social isolation of poor people."
NABRE,20,19,8,[5] Wisdom benefits the one who practices it.
NABRE,20,19,11,[6] The paradox is that one obtains one thing by giving up another.
NABRE,20,19,12,[7] An observation on the exercise of royal power. Both images suggest royal attitudes are beyond human control. Colon A is a variant of <a href='/NABRE/20/20/2'>20:2</a>a and colon B of <a href='/NABRE/20/16/15'>16:15</a>b.
NABRE,20,19,13,"[8] One of many sayings about domestic happiness. The perspective is male; the two greatest pains to a father is a malicious son and an unsuitable wife. The immediately following saying is on the noble wife, perhaps to make a positive statement about women."
NABRE,20,19,18,[9] The pain of disciplining the young cannot be compared with the danger no discipline may bring. The chief reason for disciplining the young is their capacity to change; excluded thereby are revenge and punishment.
NABRE,20,19,22,"[10] The proverb has been read in two ways: (1) ""Desire (greed) is a shame to a person,"" which assumes the rare Hebrew word for ""shame"" is being used; (2) ""What is desired in a person is fidelity."" The second interpretation is preferable. The context may be the court: better to forego money (a bribe) than perjure oneself."
NABRE,20,19,26,[11] Children who disgrace the family equivalently plunder their fathers wealth and expel their mother from the home.
NABRE,20,19,27,[12] The meaning was disputed even in antiquity. The interpretation that most respects the syntax is to take it as ironic advice as in <a href='/NABRE/20/22/6'>22:6</a>: to stop (listening) is to go (wandering).
NABRE,20,20,1,"[1] The cause stands for its effect (wine, drunken behavior). In Proverbs wine is a sign of prosperity and a symbol of feasting (<a href='/NABRE/20/3/10'>3:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/4/17'>4:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/9/2'>9:2, 5</a>) but also a potential threat to wisdom as in <a href='/NABRE/20/20/1'>20:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/21/17'>21:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/23/29'>23:29-35</a>."
NABRE,20,20,3,[2] The honor that one might seek to gain from fighting comes of itself to the person who refrains from fighting.
NABRE,20,20,5,"[3] The heart is where human plans are made and stored; they remain ""deep water"" until words reveal them to others. The wise know how to draw up those waters, i.e., express them. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/18/4'>18:4</a>."
NABRE,20,20,8,[4] The royal throne is established in justice and the king is the agent of that justice.
NABRE,20,20,9,[5] A claim to sinlessness can be merely self-deception; see <a href='/NABRE/20/16/2'>16:2</a>; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/20/15/11'>15:11</a>.
NABRE,20,20,11,"[6] The verb in colon A can mean either ""to make oneself known"" or ""to play another person"" (as in <a href='/NABRE/1/42/7'>GEN 42:7</a> and <a href='/NABRE/11/14/5'>1KG 14:5, 6</a>). The second meaning makes a better parallel to colon B. The meaning is that if a child can playact, an adult can do so even more. Actions do not always reveal character."
NABRE,20,20,12,[7] Human judgments are not ultimate; the Lord expects proper use of these faculties.
NABRE,20,20,14,[8] Bartering invites playacting and masking ones true intent. The truth of words depends on their context.
NABRE,20,20,15,"[9] Wisdom is said to be preferable to gold in <a href='/NABRE/20/3/14'>3:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/8/10'>8:10, 19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/16/16'>16:16</a>. Colon B suggests that the gold and jewelry here are ornaments for the face (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/24/53'>GEN 24:53</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/3/22'>EXO 3:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/61/10'>ISA 61:10</a>). Wise lips are the most beautiful adornment, for they display the wisdom of the heart."
NABRE,20,20,16,"[10] The text is not clear. See <a href='/NABRE/20/27/13'>27:13</a>. Caution in becoming surety is always advised (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/1'>6:1-3</a>), and it is especially advisable with strangers."
NABRE,20,20,20,"[11] Their lamp will go out: misfortune, even death, awaits them; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/13/9'>13:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/21/17'>EXO 21:17</a>."
NABRE,20,20,21,"[12] By definition, an inheritance is not gained by ones own efforts but is received as a gift. If, when one first receives the inheritance, one drives everyone away, one treats it as if one acquired it by ones own efforts. In an agricultural society, an inheritance would often be a field that would require Gods blessing to be fertile."
NABRE,20,20,22,[13] Appointing oneself an agent of divine retribution is dangerous. Better to wait for God to effect justice. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/17'>24:17-18</a>.
NABRE,20,20,24,[14] An indication of the Lords inscrutable providence; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/10/23'>JER 10:23</a>; see <a href='/NABRE/20/21/2'>PRO 21:2</a>; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/20/14/12'>14:12</a>.
NABRE,20,20,25,[15] This verse cautions against making vows without proper reflection; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/23/22'>DEU 23:22-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/5/4'>ECC 5:4-5</a>.
NABRE,20,20,26,"[16] The king is responsible for effecting justice. Judgment is portrayed in agricultural imagery—exposing grain to a current of air so that the chaff is blown away, and passing a wheel over the cereal to break the husk. Winnowing as image for judgment is found throughout the Bible."
NABRE,20,20,27,"[17] A parallel is drawn between the life-breath that is Gods gift (<a href='/NABRE/18/32/8'>JOB 32:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/33/2'>33:2</a>) coursing through the human body (<a href='/NABRE/23/2/22'>ISA 2:22</a>) and the lamp of God, which can be a symbol of divine scrutiny. In <a href='/NABRE/36/1/12'>ZEP 1:12</a>, God declares, ""And in that day I will search through Jerusalem with lamps."""
NABRE,20,21,1,"[1] ""Channeled water"" in <a href='/NABRE/23/32/2'>ISA 32:2</a> and <a href='/NABRE/20/5/16'>PRO 5:16</a> is water that fertilizes arid land. It takes great skill to direct water, whether it be water to fertilize fields or cosmic floods harnessed at creation, for water is powerful and seems to have a mind of its own. It also requires great skill to direct the heart of a king, for it is inscrutable and beyond ordinary human control."
NABRE,20,21,3,[2] External rites or sacrifices do not please God unless accompanied by internal worship and right moral conduct; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/15/8'>15:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/21/27'>21:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/1/11'>ISA 1:11-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/5/22'>AMO 5:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/39/1/12'>MAL 1:12</a>.
NABRE,20,21,4,"[3] Heart and eyes depict, respectively, the inner and the outer person. ""Haughty eyes"" peering out from a ""proud heart"" show a thoroughly arrogant person. How can such a person flourish! Their lamp, which signifies life, will go out."
NABRE,20,21,5,[4] The antitheses are diligent and impetuous. The metaphor characterizing each type is taken from the world of commerce. Planning is important; bustle leads to waste.
NABRE,20,21,8,[5] One cannot always read others hearts from their behavior. Unconventional conduct need not indicate evil motives.
NABRE,20,21,9,"[6] In Proverbs, two great obstacles to a happy household are foolish children and quarrelsome spouses. The nagging wife is also mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/20/19/13'>19:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/27/15'>27:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/25/24'>25:24</a> is a duplicate."
NABRE,20,21,12,"[7] It is difficult to ascertain the subject of the saying. Some hold it is the Lord, the ""Righteous One,"" who is normally the executor of justice in Proverbs. Others believe it is the just person who is the agent of divine justice. ""Righteous One"" is a title for God in <a href='/NABRE/23/24/16'>ISA 24:16</a>. The best argument for making God the subject of the verb is that elsewhere in Proverbs righteous human beings never do anything to the wicked; only God does."
NABRE,20,21,14,"[8] Proverbs offers several remedies for anger—a soft word (<a href='/NABRE/20/15/1'>15:1</a>), patience, and a bribe. The last remedy implies a certain disdain for the disordered passion of anger, for it can be so easily assuaged by a discreetly offered ""gift."""
NABRE,20,21,15,[9] The second line is a duplicate of <a href='/NABRE/20/10/29'>10:29</a>b.
NABRE,20,21,16,[10] Assembly of the shades: those who dwell in Sheol.
NABRE,20,21,18,"[11] In this bold paradox, the ransom that protects the righteous is the wicked person who attracts, like a lightning rod, the divine wrath that might have been directed at the righteous."
NABRE,20,21,21,[12] The paradox is that one comes upon something other than what one pursued. The way to (long and healthy) life and honor is the vigorous pursuit of virtue.
NABRE,20,21,23,"[13] Themselves: see note on <a href='/NABRE/20/13/3'>13:3</a>. To guard your ""self"" (lit., ""throat,"" the moist and breathing center of the body, by metonymy, ""life""), you must guard your tongue. Speech in Proverbs is the quintessential human activity and often has a meaning broader than speech alone; it can stand for all human activity. Acting rightly is the best way to protect yourself from evil."
NABRE,20,21,25,"[14] Desire, or appetite, is the impulse toward food and drink (see <a href='/NABRE/19/42/3'>PS 42:3</a>) which spurs animals and human beings into action. But sluggards cannot lift hand to mouth; they bury their hand in the dish (<a href='/NABRE/20/19/24'>19:24</a>), and so their appetite is thwarted."
NABRE,20,21,29,"[15] The wicked cannot deter the righteous from walking the straight path, i.e., from practicing virtue."
NABRE,20,22,1,"[1] ""Good name"" (Heb. shem) and ""high esteem"" (Heb. chen) are declared to be of more value than great riches. Human beings belong to a community and without the acceptance of that community, which is built on esteem and trust, human life is grievously damaged. Riches are less essential to the human spirit."
NABRE,20,22,3,"[2] The wise see dangers before they are engulfed by them whereas fools, through dullness or boldness, march right on."
NABRE,20,22,4,"[3] Humiliation can be an occasion for knowing ones place in Gods world. Such knowledge is part of fear (or revering) of the Lord. Revering the Lord brings the blessings of wealth, honor, and long life. The saying is perhaps meant to counter the view that humiliation is an unmixed evil; something good can come of it."
NABRE,20,22,6,"[4] One of the few exhortations in the collection (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/14/7'>14:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/16/3'>16:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/19/18'>19:18, 20</a>). ""Way"" in the first colon has been taken in two different senses: (1) the morally right way, ""according to the way one ought to go""; (2) personal aptitude, i.e., the manner of life for which one is destined, as ""the way of Egypt"" (<a href='/NABRE/23/10/24'>ISA 10:24</a>). Neither interpretation, however, accounts for the pronoun in the Hebrew phrase, lit., ""his own way."" The most natural solution is to take the whole as ironic advice (like <a href='/NABRE/20/19/27'>19:27</a>): yes, go ahead and let the young do exactly what they want; they will become self-willed adults."
NABRE,20,22,7,"[5] An observation on money and power. One who borrows becomes poor in the sense of indebted, a slave to the lender."
NABRE,20,22,8,"[6] Agricultural metaphors express the failure of malicious actions. In the first line, bad actions are seeds yielding trouble. In the second line, ""the rod"" is a flail used to beat grains as in <a href='/NABRE/23/28/27'>ISA 28:27</a>."
NABRE,20,22,13,"[7] To avoid the effort required for action, the sluggard exaggerates the difficulties that must be overcome."
NABRE,20,22,15,"[8] Folly is attached to children as the husk is attached to the grain. ""Rod"" here, as in v. <a href='/NABRE/20/22/8'>8</a>, seems to be the flail. Discipline is the process of winnowing away the folly."
NABRE,20,22,16,"[9] A difficult saying. One possibility is to take it as a seemingly neutral observation on the plight of the poor: taking money from the poor is relatively easy for the powerful but it is dangerous as the poor have the Lord as their defender (<a href='/NABRE/20/24/22'>24:22-23</a>), who will punish their oppressors. Giving to the rich, perhaps to win their favor by presents and bribes, is equally a waste of money, for the rich will always do what they please in any case."
NABRE,20,22,17,"[10] 22:17-24:22 This collection consists of an introduction (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/17'>22:17-21</a>) urging openness and stating the purpose of the Words and diverse admonitions, aphorisms, and counsels. It is written with faith in the Lord, shrewdness, and a satirical eye. The first part seems aimed at young people intent on a career (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/22'>22:22</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/23/11'>23:11</a>); the second is taken up with the concerns of youth (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/12'>23:12-35</a>); the third part is interested in the ultimate fate of the good and the wicked (<a href='/NABRE/20/24/1'>24:1-22</a>). The whole can be described as a guidebook of professional ethics. The aim is to inculcate trust in the Lord and to help readers avoid trouble and advance their careers by living according to wisdom. Its outlook is very practical: avoid bad companions because in time you will take on some of their qualities; do not post bond for others because you yourself will be encumbered; do not promote yourself too aggressively because such promotion is self-defeating; do not abuse sex or alcohol because they will harm you; do not emulate your peers if they are wicked (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/14'>23:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/24/1'>24:1, 19</a>) because such people have no future. Rather, trust the vocation of a sage (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/29'>22:29</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/23/9'>23:9</a>). The Egyptian Instructions of Amenemope(written ca. 1100 B.C.) was discovered in 1923. Scholars immediately recognized it as a source of <a href='/NABRE/20/22/17'>PRO 22:17</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/23/11'>23:11</a>. The Egyptian work has thirty chapters (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/22/20'>PRO 22:20</a>); its preface resembled <a href='/NABRE/20/22/17'>PRO 22:17-21</a>; its first two admonitions matched the first two in Proverbs (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/22'>PRO 22:22-25</a>). There are many other resemblances as well, some of which are pointed out in the notes. The instruction of a father to his son (or an administrator to his successor) was a well-known genre in Egypt; seventeen works are extant, spanning the period from 2500 B.C. to the first century A.D. The instructions aimed to help a young person live a happy and prosperous life and avoid mistakes that cause difficulties. They make concrete and pragmatic suggestions rather than hold up abstract ideals. Pragmatic though they were, the instructions were religious; they assumed that the gods implanted an order in the world (Egyptian maat), which is found both in nature and in the human world. Amenemoperepresents a stage in the development of the Egyptian genre, displaying a new inwardness and quest for serenity while still assuming that the practice of virtue brings worldly success. Proverbs borrows from the Egyptian work with great freedom: it does not, for example, import as such the Egyptian concept of order; it engages the reader with its characteristic wit, irony, and paradox (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/20/22/26'>22:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/23/1'>23:1-3</a>)."
NABRE,20,22,17,"[11] 22:17-23:35 The maxims warn against: robbing the poor and defenseless (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/22'>22:22-23</a>), anger (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/24'>22:24-25</a>), giving surety for debts (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/26'>22:26-27</a>), advancing oneself by socializing with rulers (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/1'>23:1-2</a>), anxiety for riches (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/4'>23:4-5</a>), forcing oneself on a grudging host (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/6'>23:6-8</a>), intemperance in food and drink (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/19'>23:19-21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/23/29'>29-35</a>), and adultery (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/26'>23:26-28</a>). They exhort to: careful workmanship (<a href='/NABRE/20/22/29'>22:29</a>), respect for the rights of orphans (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/10'>23:10-11</a>), correction of the young (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/13'>23:13-14</a>), filial piety (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/15'>23:15-16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/23/22'>22-25</a>), and fear of the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/20/23/17'>23:17-18</a>)."
NABRE,20,22,22,"[12] At the gate: of the city, where justice was administered and public affairs discussed; cf. <a href='/NABRE/8/4/1'>RUT 4:1</a>. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/19/69/13'>PS 69:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/127/5'>127:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/24/7'>PRO 24:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/31/23'>31:23, 31</a>. The Lord will personally avenge those who have no one to defend them."
NABRE,20,22,27,[13] Providing surety for a debtor puts one in danger of having the very basics of ones life suddenly seized.
NABRE,20,22,28,[14] Landmark: marks the boundary of property. To remove it is the equivalent of stealing land. A similar warning is contained in <a href='/NABRE/20/23/10'>23:10</a>.
NABRE,20,23,1,[1] 23:1-9 Four admonitions for someone aspiring to be a sage: be careful about advancing your career by socializing with the great (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/23/1'>1-3</a>); avoid greed (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/23/4'>4-5</a>); do not force yourself on an unwilling host (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/23/6'>6-8</a>); do not waste your wisdom on those who cannot profit from it (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/23/9'>9</a>).
NABRE,20,23,2,"[2] Stick the knife in your gullet: a metaphor for self-restraint. The usual translation, ""Put a knife to your throat,"" is misleading, for in English it is a death threat. The exhortation is humorously exaggerated: stick the table-knife in your own gullet rather than take too much food. It assumes that the young courtier is unused to opulent banquets and will be tempted to overindulgence."
NABRE,20,23,5,"[3] The frustration of covetous intent and elusiveness of wealth are portrayed by the sudden flight of an eagle. Amenemope, chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a>, has a similar statement: ""Do not set your heart on wealth. There is no ignoring Fate and Destiny; / Do not let your heart go straying."" Proverbs imagines covetous intent as a flight of the eyes, whereas Amenemopeimagines it as a straying of the heart."
NABRE,20,23,6,"[4] 23:6-8 Some humorous advice on not trading on the courtesy of unwilling hosts who, for conventions sake, use the language of welcome. Amenemope, chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/11/1'>11</a>, gives similar advice: ""Do not intrude on a man in his house, / Enter when you have been called; / He may say Welcome with his mouth, / Yet deride you in his thoughts."" ""Unwilling,"" lit., ""evil of eye,"" is usually translated ""stingy,"" but the context suggests unwilling. In v. <a href='/NABRE/20/23/8'>8</a>, the unwanted guest vomits up the food, thus destroying the desired good impression. Proverbs regards the uninvited banqueters as thieves who will suffer the consequences of their theft. Amenemope, chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/11/1'>11</a>, is relevant: ""Do not covet a poor mans goods,…A poor mans goods are a block in the throat, / It makes the gullet vomit."""
NABRE,20,23,10,"[5] In Israel ownership of property and other legal rights were vested mainly in the father as head of the family; thus the widow and fatherless child were vulnerable, left prey to those who would exploit them."
NABRE,20,23,13,"[6] 23:13-14 The young will not die from instructional blows but from their absence, for (premature) death results from uncorrected folly. The sardonic humor means the exhortation is not to be taken literally, as an argument for corporal punishment. The next verses (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/23/15'>15-16</a>) are exceedingly tender toward the young."
NABRE,20,23,17,"[7] Those whom one admires or associates with exercise enormous influence. Do not join the wicked, who are a doomed group. The warning is repeated in <a href='/NABRE/20/24/1'>24:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/24/19'>19-20</a>."
NABRE,20,23,22,"[8] 23:22-23 Father and mother are associated with truth and wisdom. One should no more rid oneself of truth and wisdom than rid oneself of ones parents, who are their source."
NABRE,20,23,26,"[9] 23:26-28 The exhortation is a condensed version of chap. <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7</a> with its emotional appeal to ""my son"" to avoid the forbidden woman (<a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7:1-5</a>), her traps (<a href='/NABRE/20/7/21'>7:21-23</a>), and her intent to add the youth to her list of victims (<a href='/NABRE/20/7/24'>7:24-27</a>). As in <a href='/NABRE/20/23/15'>23:15, 19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/23/22'>22</a>, a trustful and affectionate relationship between student and teacher is the basis of teaching. The danger of the woman is expressed in imagery that has sexual overtones (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/22/14'>22:14</a>)."
NABRE,20,23,29,"[10] 23:29-35 A vivid description of the evil effects, physical and psychological, of drunkenness. The emphasis is on the unwise behavior, the folly, caused by alcohol. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/20/1'>20:1</a>."
NABRE,20,23,35,[11] Drunkards become insensible to bodily and moral harm. Their one desire is to indulge again.
NABRE,20,24,1,"[1] 24:1-22 A new section (<a href='/NABRE/20/24/1'>24:1-14</a>)—on the fates of the wicked and foolish—begins with a warning not to take the foolish as role models. The same admonition is repeated in <a href='/NABRE/20/23/17'>23:17-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/24/19'>24:19-20</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/20/24/1'>24:1</a>, the verb means ""to be jealous, zealous; to emulate."" The motive stated in the other passages—the wicked have no future—is indirectly stated here."
NABRE,20,24,7,"[2] 24:7-9 The verses are unclear; most scholars take them as two or even three single sayings, but, taken singly, the verses are banal. They are best taken as a single statement. Just as vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/3'>3-6</a> described the advantages of wisdom, so vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/7'>7-9</a> describe the disadvantages of its opposite, folly: it alienates one from the community (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/7'>7</a>), for fools become notorious (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/8'>8</a>), dooming their plans and ostracizing themselves."
NABRE,20,24,10,"[3] 24:10-12 Excuses for not coming to the aid of ones neighbor in serious trouble do not suffice before God, who sees through self-serving excuses."
NABRE,20,24,11,[4] Rescue…death: perhaps refers to the legal rescue of those unjustly condemned to death.
NABRE,20,24,13,"[5] 24:13-14 Gods word is sometimes said to be sweeter than honey, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/19/119/101'>PS 119:101-103</a>. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/19/19/11'>PS 19:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/16/24'>PRO 16:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/3/3'>EZE 3:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/24/19'>SIR 24:19-22</a>."
NABRE,20,24,15,[6] 24:15-16 The just will overcome every misfortune that oppresses them. Seven timesis an indefinite number.
NABRE,20,24,17,"[7] 24:17-18 The admonition is linked to the previous by the words ""fall"" and ""stumble."" Premature public celebration of the downfall of enemies equivalently preempts the retribution that belongs to God."
NABRE,20,24,23,"[8] 24:23-34 A little collection between the thirty sayings of <a href='/NABRE/20/22/17'>22:17</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/24/22'>24:22</a> and the Hezekiah collection in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/20/25/1'>25</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/29/1'>29</a>. Its title (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/23'>23</a>) suggests that editors took it as an appendix. At this point, the Greek edition of Proverbs begins to arrange the later sections of the book in a different order than the Hebrew edition. Wisdom in work:Positive (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/27'>27</a>)Negative (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/30'>30-34</a>)"
NABRE,20,24,26,[9] The kiss is a gesture of respect and affection. The greatest sign of affection and respect for another is to tell that person the truth.
NABRE,20,24,27,"[10] House: can refer to both the building and the family (cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/7/1'>2SM 7</a>). In the context established by the placement noted above under <a href='/NABRE/20/24/23'>24:23</a>, the saying means that neglect of ones field is a sign that one is not building the house properly. In an agricultural society especially, the concept of household includes fields for animals and crops. On the metaphorical level, one must lay a careful preparation before embarking on a great project. This verse is sometimes interpreted as advocating careful and practical preparation for marriage."
NABRE,20,24,29,"[11] Retribution is a long and complex process that belongs to the Lord, not to individuals. Cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/12'>12d</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/24/17'>17-18</a>."
NABRE,20,24,30,"[12] 24:30-34 Neglect of ones fields through laziness ruins all plans to build a house (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/27'>27</a>). This vignette is a teaching story, like those in <a href='/NABRE/20/7/1'>7:1-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/37/35'>PS 37:35-36</a>."
NABRE,20,25,1,"[1] 25:1-29:27 Chaps. 25-29 make up the fifth collection in the book, and the third longest. King Hezekiah reigned in Judah in 715-687 B.C. According to <a href='/NABRE/12/18/1'>2KG 18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/20/1'>20</a> and <a href='/NABRE/14/29/1'>2CH 29</a>-<a href='/NABRE/14/32/1'>32</a>, he initiated political and religious reforms after the destruction of the Northern Kingdom in 722 B.C. Such reforms probably included copying and editing sacred literature such as Proverbs. <a href='/NABRE/20/25/1'>PRO 25:1</a> is an important piece of evidence about the composition of the book, suggesting this collection was added to an already-existing collection also attributed to Solomon. The older collection is probably <a href='/NABRE/20/10/1'>10:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/20/22/16'>22:16</a> (or part of it). By the end of the eighth century B.C., therefore, there existed in Israel two large collections of aphorisms. Chap. 25 has two general themes: (1) social hierarchy, rank, or position; (2) social conflict and its resolution."
NABRE,20,25,1,"[2] The servants of Hezekiah: presumably scribes at the court of Hezekiah. Transmitted: lit., ""to move, transfer from,"" hence ""to collect,"" and perhaps also to arrange and compose."
NABRE,20,25,2,[3] 25:2-7 The topic is the king—who he is (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/25/2'>2-3</a>) and how one is to behave in his presence (vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/25/4'>4-7</a>).
NABRE,20,25,2,"[4] God and king were closely related in the ancient world and in the Bible. The king had a special responsibility for divine justice. Hence, God would give him special wisdom to search it out."
NABRE,20,25,4,[5] 25:4-5 Wisdom involves virtue as well as knowledge. As in <a href='/NABRE/19/101/1'>PS 101</a> the king cannot tolerate any wickedness in the royal service.
NABRE,20,25,6,[6] 25:6-7 An admonition with a practical motive for putting the teaching into practice. Pragmatic shrewdness suggests that we not promote ourselves but let others do it for us. See <a href='/NABRE/42/14/7'>LUK 14:7-11</a>.
NABRE,20,25,9,[7] 25:9-10 Another admonition on the use of law courts to settle personal disputes. Speak privately with your opponent lest others personal business become public and they resent you.
NABRE,20,25,16,"[8] 25:16-17 The two admonitions are complementary, expressing nicely the need to restrain the inclination for delightful things, whether for honey or friendship."
NABRE,20,25,19,"[9] ""A time of trouble"" defeats all plans (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/10/2'>10:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/11/4'>11:4</a>). At such times human resources alone are like a tooth that falls out as one bites or a foot that goes suddenly lame."
NABRE,20,25,21,"[10] 25:21-22 A memorable statement of humanity and moderation; such sentiments could be occasionally found even outside the Bible, e.g., ""It is better to bless someone than to do harm to one who has insulted you"" (Egyptian Papyrus Insinger). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/23/4'>EXO 23:4</a> and <a href='/NABRE/3/19/17'>LEV 19:17-18</a>. Human beings should not take it upon themselves to exact vengeance, leaving it rather in Gods hands. This saying has in view an enemys vulnerability in time of need, in this case extreme hunger and thirst; such a need should not be an occasion for revenge. The motive for restraining oneself is to allow Gods justice to take its own course, as in <a href='/NABRE/20/20/22'>20:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/24/17'>24:17-19</a>. Live coals: either remorse and embarrassment for the harm done, or increased punishment for refusing reconciliation. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/5/44'>MAT 5:44</a>. <a href='/NABRE/45/12/20'>ROM 12:20</a> cites the Greek version and interprets it, ""Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good."""
NABRE,20,25,24,[11] A humorous saying about domestic unhappiness: better to live alone outdoors than indoors with an angry spouse. <a href='/NABRE/20/21/9'>PRO 21:9</a> is identical and <a href='/NABRE/20/21/19'>21:19</a> is similar in thought.
NABRE,20,25,26,"[12] ""Spring"" is a common metaphor for source. The righteous should be a source of life for others. When they fail, it is as if a spring became foul and its water undrinkable. It is not clear whether the righteous person yielded to a scoundrel out of cowardice or was simply defeated by evil. The latter seems more likely, for other proverbs say the just person will never ""fall"" (lit., ""be moved,"" <a href='/NABRE/20/10/30'>10:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/12/3'>12:3</a>). The fall, even temporary, of a righteous person is a loss of life for others."
NABRE,20,25,27,[13] Nor…honor: the text is uncertain.
NABRE,20,26,1,"[1] There is no fit (""out of place"") between weather and agricultural season."
NABRE,20,26,2,"[2] The point is the similarity of actions: a hovering bird that never lands, a groundless curse that never ""lands."" It hangs in the air posing no threat to anyone."
NABRE,20,26,4,"[3] 26:4-5 There is no contradiction between these two proverbs. In their answers, the wise must protect their own interests against fools. Or perhaps the juxtaposition of the two proverbs suggests that no single proverb can resolve every problem in life."
NABRE,20,26,7,"[4] 26:7-9 Fools either abuse or are unable to use whatever knowledge they have. A thorn: a proverb is ""words spoken at the proper time"" (<a href='/NABRE/20/25/11'>25:11</a>). Fools have no sense of the right time; their statements are like thorns that fasten on clothing randomly."
NABRE,20,26,13,"[5] 26:13-16 Each verse mentions the sluggard, whom Proverbs regards with derision. The criticism is not against low energy but failure to act and take responsibility. Proverbs ideal is the active person who uses heart, lips, hands, feet to keep to the good path. The verses are examples of the sardonic humor of the book."
NABRE,20,26,20,"[6] 26:20-22 The three proverbs have a common theme—the destructive power of slanderous words. Certain words are repeated: wood and fire, talebearer."
NABRE,20,26,22,[7] Malicious gossip is compared to delicious food that is swallowed and lodges in the deepest recesses of ones body. Negative comments are seldom forgotten. <a href='/NABRE/20/18/8'>PRO 18:8</a> is a duplicate.
NABRE,20,26,23,"[8] Heart = what is within, and lips (words) = what is expressed, are compared to an earthenware jar covered with glaze."
NABRE,20,26,25,[9] Seven abominations: many evil intentions.
NABRE,20,26,26,"[10] Hate may be concealed for a time, but it will eventually issue in a deed and become known in the public assembly. There is a play on words: the consonants of the word ""hatred"" (śn) are literally concealed in the word ""pretense"" (mśn)."
NABRE,20,27,4,[1] Anger generally subsides with time but jealousy coolly calculates and plots revenge.
NABRE,20,27,5,"[2] 27:5-6 Verses 5 and 6 are concerned with true friendship. ""Better than"" sayings often declare one thing superior to another in view of some value, e.g., 15:17, vegetables are better than meat in view of a milieu of love. In v. <a href='/NABRE/20/27/5'>5</a>, a rebuke is better than an act of affection in view of discipline that imparts wisdom."
NABRE,20,27,6,[3] The present translation is conjectural. The meaning seems to be that a friends rebuke can be life-giving and an enemys kiss can be deadly (like the kiss of Judas in <a href='/NABRE/40/26/48'>MAT 26:48</a>).
NABRE,20,27,8,"[4] The bird symbolizes vulnerability as it flees before danger as in <a href='/NABRE/23/10/14'>ISA 10:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/16/2'>16:2</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/19/11/1'>PS 11:1</a>. For the importance of place in human life, see <a href='/NABRE/18/20/8'>JOB 20:8-9</a>. People are defined by their place, but, tragically, war, poverty, or illness can force them from it."
NABRE,20,27,10,"[5] The adage is about the difference between friends and kin in a crisis. Two admonitions are grounded in one maxim (colon C). The same Hebrew word means both ""one who is near"" and ""friend."" The whole proverb urges the reader to cultivate old family friends and neighbors and not to rely exclusively on kin in times of trouble, for kin may not be there for us."
NABRE,20,27,11,"[6] A fathers command to a son to be wise, another way of saying that sons or daughters bring joy or shame to their parents."
NABRE,20,27,13,[7] See note on <a href='/NABRE/20/20/16'>20:16</a>.
NABRE,20,27,14,"[8] One interpretation takes the proverb as humorous and the other takes it as serious: (1) an overly loud and ill-timed greeting (lit., ""blessing"") invites the response of a curse rather than a ""blessing"" (greeting); (2) the loud voice suggests hypocrisy in the greeting."
NABRE,20,27,17,"[9] Iron sharpens the ""face"" (panim= surface, edge) of iron, and a human being sharpens the ""face"" (panim= face, words) of another. Human beings learn from each other and grow in wisdom by conversing."
NABRE,20,27,20,"[10] Sheol, the underworld abode of the dead, is personified as a force that is never satisfied and always desires more. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/14'>ISA 5:14</a> and <a href='/NABRE/28/13/14'>HOS 13:14</a>. The saying is applicable to modern consumerism."
NABRE,20,27,23,"[11] 27:23-27 A little treatise on farming in the form of admonitions. It proposes the advantages of field and flock over other forms of wealth. Herds are the most productive wealth, for their value does not diminish; they are a source of money, clothing, and food. The thought is conservative and traditional but the development is vivid and concrete."
NABRE,20,28,2,"[1] The first line expresses the paradox that rebellion, far from doing away with rulers, actually multiplies them. The second line is corrupt."
NABRE,20,28,3,[2] The reference may be to tax farmers who collected taxes and took a commission. The collectors lack of wealth was the cause of their oppression of poor farmers. They are like a rain too violent to allow crops to grow.
NABRE,20,28,4,[3] Instruction: torah; the word is used both for the teaching of the wise and the law of Moses.
NABRE,20,28,5,"[4] Understanding nothing of justiceplays on the twofold sense of justice as righteousness and as punishment that comes on the wicked. On the other hand, those who seek the Lordunderstand everything, i.e., that the Lord punishes the wicked and rewards the righteous (themselves)."
NABRE,20,28,8,[5] Interest and overcharge were strictly forbidden in the old law among Israelites because it was presumed that the borrower was in distress; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/22/25'>EXO 22:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/25/35'>LEV 25:35-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/23/20'>DEU 23:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/15/5'>PS 15:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/18/8'>EZE 18:8</a>. Divine providence will take the offenders wealth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/21/2/26'>ECC 2:26</a>.
NABRE,20,28,12,"[6] People react in opposite ways to the triumph of good and evil. To the triumph of good, they react by public display, public celebration, and to the triumph of evil, by hiding."
NABRE,20,28,13,"[7] Concealing the faults of another is a good thing in Proverbs (<a href='/NABRE/20/17/9'>17:9</a>), but concealing ones own sins is not. <a href='/NABRE/19/32/1'>PS 32:1-5</a> expresses the anguish caused by concealing ones sins rather than bringing them to light so they can be healed by God."
NABRE,20,28,14,"[8] Fearis a different verb than in the phrase ""to fear (or revere) the Lord."" In its only other biblical occurrence (<a href='/NABRE/23/51/13'>ISA 51:13</a>), the verb means to dread an oppressor. The saying states a paradox: those who fear in the sense of being cautious are declared happy, whereas those who are fearless will fall into traps they did not ""fear."" In short, there is good fear and bad fear."
NABRE,20,28,21,[9] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/24/23'>24:23</a>. Verse 21b warns that even in a light matter one must remain impartial.
NABRE,20,28,22,"[10] ""Bad of eye"" is the Hebrew idiom for miserly. Misers fail to see that poverty is hurrying toward them because of their wrong attitude toward wealth. Because misers are ""bad of eye,"" they do not see the danger."
NABRE,20,29,1,"[1] The idiom ""to stiffen ones neck"" occurs in a context of not heeding a message in <a href='/NABRE/5/10/16'>DEU 10:16</a> and <a href='/NABRE/12/17/14'>2KG 17:14</a>. To stiffen ones neck in this sense risks having it broken, as in <a href='/NABRE/9/4/18'>1SM 4:18</a>."
NABRE,20,29,2,"[2] Popular response to a just or unjust ruler is expressed in sound—shouts of joy or groans of anguish. ""Rejoice"" can mean to express ones joy, i.e., joyous shouts."
NABRE,20,29,4,"[3] In Hebrew as in English high and low are metaphors for prosperity and depression. A king who is just ""causes the land to stand up,"" i.e., to be prosperous, and one who makes taxes high brings a country low."
NABRE,20,29,5,"[4] When one addresses deceptive words to someones face, one equivalently throws a net at their feet to snare them."
NABRE,20,29,7,"[5] As in <a href='/NABRE/20/12/10'>12:10</a> (on care for animals), the righteous care for those who are without a voice and often treated like animals. Colon B has a double meaning: the wicked have no such knowledge (care for the poor) and they have no knowledge (wisdom), for they are fools."
NABRE,20,29,10,"[6] An enigmatic saying in that ""seek ones life"" is a common idiom for killing. The saying probably plays on the idiom, interpreting ""to seek the life of another"" not as killing but as caring for another (as in <a href='/NABRE/20/11/30'>11:30</a>)."
NABRE,20,29,16,"[7] When the wicked grow numerous they sow the seeds of their own destruction, for there is a corresponding increase in offenses calling down divine retribution."
NABRE,20,29,18,"[8] This much-cited proverb has been interpreted in several different ways. ""Vision"" and ""instruction"" mean authoritative guidance for the community. People are demoralized without credible leadership, but any individual heeding traditional instruction can still find happiness. As in <a href='/NABRE/20/15/15'>15:15</a> wisdom enables an individual to surmount days of trouble."
NABRE,20,29,19,"[9] The give and take of reproving is not possible for servants or slaves. Ancient custom dictated silent acquiescence for them. There is no open and free dialogue, which is part of ancient discipline."
NABRE,20,29,23,[10] Ones prideful height brings one down and ones lowly state brings glory.
NABRE,20,29,24,"[11] Hate themselves: because they not only incur guilt as accomplices but, by their silence, bring down on themselves the curse invoked on the unknown guilty partner. Such a case is envisioned in <a href='/NABRE/3/5/1'>LEV 5:1</a>. After a theft, a public proclamation was made, enforced by a curse. No one in a town or city could avoid hearing it. The curse hung over the accomplice. By doing nothing, neither directly stealing nor confessing, accomplices put themselves in serious danger."
NABRE,20,30,1,"[1] 30:1-6 Scholars are divided on the original literary unit. Is it vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/1'>1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/30/1'>1-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/30/1'>1-5</a>, or 1-6? The unit is probably vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/1'>1-6</a>, for a single contrast dominates: human fragility (and ignorance) and divine power (and knowledge). A similar contrast is found in <a href='/NABRE/18/28/1'>JOB 28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/73/1'>PS 73</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/49/1'>ISA 49:1-4</a>. The language of self-abasement is hyperbolic; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/9/8'>2SM 9:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/73/21'>PS 73:21-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/25/4'>JOB 25:4-6</a>. Agur: an unknown person. Massaite: from Massa in northern Arabia, elsewhere referred to as an encampment of the Ishmaelites (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/14'>GEN 25:14</a>). But Heb. massamay not be intended as a place name; it might signify ""an oracle,"" ""a prophecy,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/23/15/1'>ISA 15:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/17/1'>17:1</a>; etc."
NABRE,20,30,3,[2] 30:3-4 Agur denies he has secret heavenly knowledge. The purpose of the denial is to underline that God directly gives wisdom to those whose conduct pleases him.
NABRE,20,30,4,"[3] The Hebrew text has the phrase ""do you know?"" at the end of v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/4'>4</a>, which is supported by the versions. The phrase, however, does not appear in the important Greek manuscripts Vaticanus and Sinaiticus and spoils the sense, for Agur, not God, is the questioner. The phrase seems to be an addition to the Hebrew text, borrowed from <a href='/NABRE/18/38/5'>JOB 38:5</a>, where it also follows a cosmic question."
NABRE,20,30,5,"[4] 30:5-6 Verse 5, like the confession of the king in <a href='/NABRE/19/18/31'>PS 18:31</a> (and its parallel, <a href='/NABRE/10/22/31'>2SM 22:31</a>), expresses total confidence in the one who rescues from death. Agur has refused a word from any other except God and makes an act of trust in God."
NABRE,20,30,7,"[5] 30:7-9 A prayer against lying words and for sufficiency of goods, lest reaction to riches or destitution lead to offenses against God."
NABRE,20,30,11,"[6] 30:11-14 Perverted people are here classified as unfilial (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/11'>11</a>), self-righteous (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/12'>12</a>), proud (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/13'>13</a>) and rapacious (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/14'>14</a>)."
NABRE,20,30,15,"[7] 30:15-16 Here begins a series of numerical sayings; the pattern is n, n + 1. The slight variation in number (two and three, three and four) is an example of parallelism applied to numbers. The poetic technique is attested even outside the Bible. Two daughters: ""Give,"" and ""Give"": the text is obscure; as the leech (a bloodsucking worm) is insatiable in its desire for blood (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/15'>15</a>), so are the nether world for victims, the barren womb for offspring, the earth for water, and fire for fuel (v. <a href='/NABRE/20/30/16'>16</a>). Sheol: here not so much the place of the dead as a force (death) that eventually draws all the living into it; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/27/20'>27:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/5/14'>ISA 5:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/35/2/5'>HAB 2:5</a>. Land…fire: land (especially the dry land of Palestine) always absorbs more water; fire always requires more fuel."
NABRE,20,30,18,"[8] 30:18-19 The soaring flight of the eagle, the mysterious movement upon a rock of the serpent which has no feet, the path of the ship through the trackless deep, and the marvelous attraction between the sexes; there is a mysterious way common to them all."
NABRE,20,30,20,[9] This verse portrays the indifference of an adulterous woman who casually dismisses her guilt because it cannot be traced.
NABRE,20,30,21,"[10] 30:21-23 Shaking heavens are part of general cosmic upheaval in <a href='/NABRE/23/14/16'>ISA 14:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/2/10'>JOE 2:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/8/8'>AMO 8:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/9/6'>JOB 9:6</a>. Disturbances in nature mirror the disturbance of unworthy people attaining what they do not deserve. Glutted with food: someone unworthy ends up with the fulfillment that befits a wise person. Unloved woman: an older woman who, contrary to expectation, finds a husband."
NABRE,20,30,24,"[11] 30:24-28 The creatures may be small, but they are wise in knowing how to govern themselves—the definition of wisdom. Badgers: the rock badger is able to live on rocky heights that provide security from its enemies. Locusts: though vulnerable individually their huge swarms are impossible to deflect."
NABRE,20,30,29,[12] 30:29-31 Four beings with an imperiousness visible in their walk. Only the lion is described in detail; the reader is expected to transpose its qualities to the others.
NABRE,20,30,32,"[13] 30:32-33 The same Hebrew verb, ""to churn, shake,"" is applied to milk, the nose (sometimes a symbol of anger), and wrath. In each case something is eventually produced by the constant agitation. The wise make peace and avoid strife, for strife eventually harms those who provoke it."
NABRE,20,31,1,"[1] 31:1-9 Though mothers are sources of wisdom in Proverbs (<a href='/NABRE/20/1/8'>1:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/6/20'>6:20</a>), the mother of Lemuel is special in being queen mother, which was an important position in the palace. Queen mothers played an important role in ancient palace life because of their longevity, knowledge of palace politics, and loyalty to their sons; they were in a good position to offer him sound counsel. The language of the poem contains Aramaisms, a sign of its non-Israelite origin. The first section, vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/3'>3-5</a>, warns against abuse of sex and alcohol (wine, strong drink) lest the king forgetthe poor. The second section, vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/6'>6-9</a>, urges the use of alcohol (strong drink, wine) so that the downtrodden poorcan forgettheir poverty. The real subject of the poem is justice for the poor."

NABRE,20,31,2,"[3] My son: in the Septuagint, ""my son, my firstborn."""
NABRE,20,31,3,"[4] The Hebrew word here translated ""strength"" normally means ""ways,"" but the context and a cognate language support ""authority"" or ""strength"" here."
NABRE,20,31,10,"[5] 31:10-31 An acrostic poem of twenty-two lines; each line begins with a successive letter of the Hebrew alphabet. As with many other acrostic poems in the Bible, the unity of the poem is largely extrinsic, coming not from the narrative logic but from the familiar sequence of letters. The topic is the ideal woman described through her activity as a wife. Some have suggested that the traditional hymn extolling the great deeds of a warrior has been transposed to extol a heroic wife; the focus is on her exploits. She runs a household distinguished by abundant food and clothing for all within, by its trade (import of raw materials and export of finished products), and by the renown of its head, her husband, in the community. At v. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/28'>28</a>, the voice is no longer that of the narrator but of her children and husband as they praise her. The purpose of the poem has been interpreted variously: an encomium to offset the sometimes negative portrayal of women in the book, or, more symbolically (and more likely), a portrait of a household ruled by Woman Wisdom and a disciple of Woman Wisdom, i.e., he now has a worthy wife and children, a great household, renown in the community."
NABRE,20,31,10,[6] Who can find…?: in <a href='/NABRE/20/20/6'>20:6</a> and <a href='/NABRE/21/8/1'>ECC 8:1</a> the question implies that finding such a person is well-nigh impossible.
NABRE,20,31,12,"[7] Profit, not loss: a commercial metaphor."
NABRE,20,31,14,"[8] Like a merchant fleet: she has her eye on the far horizon, like the ship of a merchant ready to bring supplies into her larder. It is the only simile (""like"") in the poem."
NABRE,20,31,17,[9] The metaphor of clothing oneself is used to show the womans readiness. One can gird on weapons of war and might and splendor (<a href='/NABRE/19/69/7'>PS 69:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/52/9'>ISA 52:9</a>).
NABRE,20,31,18,[10] Her lamp is never extinguished at night: indicates abundance of productive work and its accompanying prosperity; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/20/20'>20:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/18/6'>JOB 18:6</a>.
NABRE,20,31,19,"[11] The wife weaves linen cloth from flax and wool from fleece, which she cultivated according to v. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/13'>13</a>. Distaff: staff for holding the flax, tow, or wool, which in spinning was drawn out and twisted into yarn or thread by the spindle or round stick."
NABRE,20,31,23,"[12] The husband is mentioned for the first time since vv. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/10'>10-12</a> but as ""her husband."" He will not be mentioned again until v. <a href='/NABRE/20/31/28'>28</a>, where he praises her."
NABRE,20,31,25,"[13] Laughs at the days to come: anticipates the future with joy, free of anxiety."
NABRE,20,31,27,"[14] Watches over: Hebrew ṣopiyyâ, perhaps a pun on the Greek sophia(= wisdom). Bread of idleness: she does not eat from the table of others but from her own labors."
NABRE,20,31,30,"[15] The true charm of this woman is her religious spirit, for she fears the Lord; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/20/1/7'>1:7</a>."
NABRE,21,1,1,"[1] Davids son…king in Jerusalem: the intent of the author is to identify himself with Solomon. This is a literary device, by which the author hopes to commend his work to the public under the name of Israels most famous sage (see <a href='/NABRE/11/5/9'>1KG 5:9-14</a>)."
NABRE,21,1,2,[2] Vanity of vanities: a Hebrew superlative expressing the supreme degree of futility and emptiness.
NABRE,21,1,3,"[3] Under the sun: used throughout this book to signify ""on the earth."""
NABRE,21,1,8,"[4] All things are wearisome: or, ""All speech is wearisome."""
NABRE,21,1,11,"[5] Movement in nature and human activity appears to result in change and progress. The author argues that this change and progress are an illusion: ""Nothing is new under the sun."""
NABRE,21,1,14,"[6] A chase after wind: an image of futile activity, like an attempt to corral the winds; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/12/2'>HOS 12:2</a>. The ancient versions understood ""affliction, dissipation of the spirit."" This phrase concludes sections of the text as far as <a href='/NABRE/21/6/9'>6:9</a>."
NABRE,21,1,15,[7] You cannot count what is not there: perhaps originally a commercial metaphor alluding to loss or deficit in the accounts ledger.
NABRE,21,1,18,"[8] Sorrow…grief: these terms refer not just to a store of knowledge or to psychological or emotional pain. Corporal punishment, sometimes quite harsh, was also employed frequently by parents and teachers."
NABRE,21,2,1,"[1] 2:1-11 The author here assumes the role of Solomon who, as king, would have had the wealth and resources at his disposal to acquire wisdom and engage in pleasurable pursuits. Verses 4-8 in particular, with their description of abundant wealth and physical gratifications, parallel the descriptions in <a href='/NABRE/11/4/1'>1KG 4</a>-<a href='/NABRE/11/11/1'>11</a> of the extravagances of Solomons reign."
NABRE,21,2,3,"[2] Guided by wisdom: using all the means money can buy, the author sets out on a deliberate search to discover if pleasure constitutes true happiness."
NABRE,21,2,8,"[3] Many women: the final phrase of this verse is difficult to translate. One word, shiddah, which appears here in both singular and plural, is found nowhere else in the Hebrew Bible. A suggested meaning is ""woman"" or ""concubine,"" as it is interpreted here: ""many women."" The rest of the section (<a href='/NABRE/21/2/1'>2:1-12</a>) seems to be a description of Solomons kingdom, and the ""many women"" would represent his huge harem (<a href='/NABRE/11/11/1'>1KG 11:1-3</a>). In rabbinic Hebrew the word comes to mean ""chest"" or ""coffer."""
NABRE,21,2,12,"[4] What…been done: the verse is difficult and elliptical. The words ""He can do only"" have been added for clarity. The two halves of the verse have been reversed. The author argues that it is useless to repeat the royal experiment described in vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/2/1'>1-11</a>. The results would only be the same."
NABRE,21,2,14,"[5] Yet I knew…befalls both: the author quotes a traditional saying upholding the advantages of wisdom, but then qualifies it. Nothing, not even wisdom itself, can give someone absolute control over their destiny and therefore guarantee any advantage."
NABRE,21,2,16,"[6] The wise person dies: death, until now only alluded to (vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/2/14'>14-15</a>), takes center stage and will constantly appear in the authors reflections through the remainder of the book."
NABRE,21,2,24,"[7] 2:24-26 The author is not advocating unrestrained indulgence. Rather he counsels acceptance of the good things God chooses to give. This is the first of seven similar conclusions that Qoheleth provides; see <a href='/NABRE/21/3/12'>3:12-13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/21/3/22'>22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/5/17'>5:17-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/8/15'>8:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/9/7'>9:7-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/11/9'>11:9</a>."
NABRE,21,2,26,"[8] According to <a href='/NABRE/21/7/15'>7:15</a> and <a href='/NABRE/21/9/1'>9:1-3</a>, God does not make an objective, evidential, moral distinction between saint and sinner. God ""gives"" as God pleases."
NABRE,21,3,1,"[1] 3:1-8 The fourteen pairs of opposites describe various human activities. The poem affirms that God has determined the appropriate moment or ""time"" for each. Human beings cannot know that moment; further, the wider course of events and purposes fixed by God are beyond them as well."
NABRE,21,3,11,"[2] The timeless: others translate ""eternity,"" ""the world,"" or ""darkness."" The author credits God with keeping human beings ignorant about Gods ""work""—present and future."
NABRE,21,3,15,"[3] The verse is difficult. Literally it reads ""and God seeks out what was pursued."" It appears to be a variation of the theme in <a href='/NABRE/21/1/9'>1:9</a>, ""There is nothing new under the sun."""
NABRE,21,3,17,"[4] A time is set…work: another possible reading would see this verse referring to a judgment in or after death: ""a time for every affair and for every work there"" (that is, in death or in Sheol)."
NABRE,21,3,21,"[5] Who knows: the author presumes a negative answer: ""No one knows."" In place of speculation on impossible questions, the author counsels enjoyment of what is possible (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/21/3/22'>22</a>; but see also <a href='/NABRE/21/2/10'>2:10-11</a>)."
NABRE,21,4,1,"[1] Oppressions…victims…none to comfort: the author obviously feels deeply about the plight of the oppressed, but he seems to feel powerless to do anything. The repetition of ""none to comfort"" is purposeful, and emphatic."
NABRE,21,4,5,"[2] Consume their own flesh: an enigmatic statement. In the context of vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/4/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/21/4/6'>6</a> it seems to warn that those who refuse to work for the necessities of life will suffer hunger and impair their bodily health. But the verse could also be intended for the industrious: Even the lazy may manage to have ""their own flesh,"" that is, have sufficient food to eat."
NABRE,21,4,12,"[3] A three-ply cord: an ancient proverb known centuries before biblical times. The progression (""two together…three-ply"") seems to imply, ""If two are good, three are even better."""
NABRE,21,4,13,"[4] 4:13-16 This passage deals with kingship and succession, but is obscure."
NABRE,21,4,15,[5] The king is no sooner dead than the people transfer their allegiance to his successor.
NABRE,21,4,17,[6] The house of God: the Temple in Jerusalem. Obedience…sacrifice: the Temple was the place not only for sacrifice but also for instruction in the Law. Sacrifice without obedience was unacceptable; cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/15/22'>1SM 15:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/6/6'>HOS 6:6</a>.
NABRE,21,5,1,"[1] 5:1-6 Further counsels on prudence and circumspection in fulfilling ones religious obligations. It is not the multitude of words but ones sincerity that counts in the acknowledgment of Gods sovereignty (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/5/1'>1</a>), especially through obedience (<a href='/NABRE/21/4/17'>4:17</a>) and reverence (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/5/6'>6</a>)."
NABRE,21,5,8,[2] A king concerned about cultivation: the Hebrew text is ambiguous and obscure. The author does not criticize the oppression he describes in v. <a href='/NABRE/21/5/7'>7</a>. Now perhaps he expresses the hope that the king would use his power to upbuild agriculture in order to alleviate the hunger and suffering of the poor and oppressed.
NABRE,21,5,19,"[3] The joys of life, though temporary and never assured, keep one from dwelling on the ills which afflict humanity."
NABRE,21,6,3,[1] Even a large family and exceptionally long life cannot compensate for the absence of good things and the joy which they bring.
NABRE,21,6,6,[2] Same place: the grave; cf. <a href='/NABRE/21/3/20'>3:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/12/7'>12:7</a>.
NABRE,21,6,7,[3] The mouth: symbolic of human desires.
NABRE,21,6,9,"[4] Compare the English proverb, ""A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush."" However, it could also mean, ""The seeing of the eyes is better than the wandering of the desire,"" with the emphasis on the actions of seeing and desiring. Seeing is a way of possessing whereas desire, by definition, can remain frustrated and unfulfilled."
NABRE,21,6,10,"[5] 6:10-11 One who is strongeris, of course, God. The more vanity: contending with God is futile."
NABRE,21,7,1,"[1] Ointment: a good name can be affirmed only with death, when one is normally anointed. The author dialogues in this section (vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/7/1'>1-14</a>) with traditional wisdom, alternately affirming or countering its assertions. The real value of traditional wisdom lies in its ability to provoke one to thought and reflection, and not to absolve one from such activity."
NABRE,21,7,12,"[2] St. Jeromes translation of v. <a href='/NABRE/21/7/12'>12b</a> gives an edge to wisdom over money: ""But learning and wisdom excel in this, that they bestow life on the one who possesses them."""
NABRE,21,7,15,"[3] 7:15-24 The author continues both to affirm and to counter traditional wisdom. He affirms a certain validity to wisdom, but challenges complacency and mindless optimism. His sense of lifes uncertainty and insecurity finds expression, for example, in the irony evident when v. <a href='/NABRE/21/7/16'>16</a> is read in the light of vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/7/20'>20-24</a>: How can one be ""excessively"" just or wise, when justice and wisdom may be out of reach to begin with? The only sure thing is to ""fear God"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/7/18'>18</a>)."
NABRE,21,7,24,"[4] Far-reaching…deep: the spatial metaphor here emphasizes wisdoms inaccessibility, a frequent theme in wisdom literature; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/28/1'>JOB 28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/30/1'>PRO 30:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/24/28'>SIR 24:28-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/73/3/14'>BAR 3:14-23</a>."
NABRE,21,7,25,"[5] 7:25-29 The emphasis is on the devious designs of human beings in general, reflecting the viewpoint of Genesis."
NABRE,21,7,26,"[6] More bitter than death…the woman: warnings against the scheming, adulterous woman are common in ancient wisdom (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/20/2/16'>PRO 2:16-19</a>, etc.)."
NABRE,21,8,1,"[1] 8:1-4 The author continues to quote traditional wisdom but then to counter and qualify it. He concedes wisdoms advantages (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/8/1'>1</a>), but then describes the subservience and sometimes demeaning demands required of the sage in the court of the king (vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/8/2'>2-4</a>)."
NABRE,21,8,5,"[2] 8:5-9 The wise exhibit keen insight about human nature and the course of events (vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/8/5'>5-6</a>a). Yet their knowledge and wisdom confront certain limits, such as the mystery of evil and the time and inevitability of death (vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/8/6'>6b</a>-9)."
NABRE,21,8,10,"[3] This difficult verse seems to contrast the wicked, who die enjoying a good reputation as pious individuals, and the just, who are quietly forgotten."
NABRE,21,8,12,"[4] 8:12-17 The author admits that traditional wisdom affirms the long life and success of the just and the short unhappy life of the wicked (vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/8/12'>12b</a>-13). But he points out clear exceptions: the wicked who live long, and the just who suffer for no apparent reason (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/8/14'>14</a>). His puzzlement and frustration prompt a twofold response: acceptance of whatever joy God chooses to give each day, and honest acknowledgment that no one can discover ""the work of God"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/21/3/11'>3:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/7/13'>7:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/11/5'>11:5</a>)."
NABRE,21,9,1,"[1] 9:1-3 Love from hatred…everything is the same: God seems to bestow divine favor or disfavor (love or hatred) indiscriminately on the just and wicked alike. More ominously, the arbitrariness and inevitability of death and adversity confront every human being, whether good or bad."
NABRE,21,9,4,"[2] 9:4-6 A live dog…no further recompense: human reason and experience persuaded Qoheleth that death with its finality and annihilating power cruelly negates the supreme value—life, and with it, all possibilities (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/21/9/10'>10</a>). Faith in eternal life has its foundation only in hope and trust in Gods promise and in Gods love."
NABRE,21,9,7,"[3] 9:7-10 Go, eat your bread…enjoy life: the author confesses his inability to imprison God in a fixed and predictable way of acting. Thus he ponders a practical and pragmatic solution: Seize whatever opportunity one has to find joy, if God grants it."
NABRE,21,10,1,[1] Dead flies…a little folly: wisdom is vulnerable to even the smallest amount of folly. The collection of proverbs and sayings in chaps. 10 and 11 demonstrates the authors sharp insight and strengthens his credentials as a sage. It thus adds weight to his critique of the wisdom traditions tendencies to self-assurance and naive optimism.
NABRE,21,10,2,"[2] Right…left: the right hand is identified with power, moral goodness, favor; the left hand with ineptness and bad luck."
NABRE,21,10,3,"[3] Calls everyone a fool: or, ""tells everyone that he (himself) is a fool."""
NABRE,21,10,4,"[4] Calmness: a frequent motif of wisdom; silence and reserve characterize the wise, while boisterousness and impetuosity identify the fool."
NABRE,21,10,7,[5] 10:6-7 A fool…the rich…slaves…princes: another wisdom motif: astonishment at the reversal of the usual order in the world and in human affairs.
NABRE,21,10,9,[6] 10:8-9 A pit…a wall…stones…wood: popular sayings reflecting the need for caution and alertness against the unexpected. Snakes could find a home in the stone walls of ancient Palestine; cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/19'>AMO 5:19</a>.
NABRE,21,10,11,"[7] 10:10-11 Ax…success…snake…charmer: possession of the proper skill (a form of ""wisdom"") can ensure success, as in the case of a sharpened ax; but one must use it before it is too late (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/10/11'>11</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/12/13'>SIR 12:13</a>."
NABRE,21,10,16,[8] A youth: thus too young and inexperienced to govern effectively. Feast in the morning: either concluding a whole night of revelry or beginning a new round of merrymaking.
NABRE,21,10,17,"[9] For vigor: or, ""with self-control, restraint."""
NABRE,21,10,19,"[10] Money answers: a stark reminder that such a life requires money. It could also be an affirmation of the power of wealth: ""Money conquers all."""
NABRE,21,10,20,"[11] Birds of the air…winged creature: a common motif in ancient literature, and a vivid reminder of the need for caution in dealing with the rich and powerful."
NABRE,21,11,1,"[1] 11:1-2 These two sayings can be understood against a commercial background. They acknowledge the uncertainty and risk such activity involves. At the same time they encourage action and a spirit of adventure. The first (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/11/1'>1</a>) speaks of trade and overseas investment: Export your grain (""bread"") to foreign markets and you may be surprised at the substantial profits. The second (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/11/2'>2</a>) encourages diversification of investment (seven, or even eight shipments of grain) to insure against heavy losses."
NABRE,21,11,3,"[2] 11:3-6 Verses 3, 4, 6 expand on the theme of uncertainty and human inability to assess accurately every situation. Verse 4, however, comments on the disadvantages of too much caution: Only those willing to risk will enjoy success. But only the Creator knows the mystery of the ""work of God"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/11/5'>5</a>)."
NABRE,21,11,7,[3] 11:7-10 The concluding part of the book opens with a final bittersweet homage to life and an enthusiastic encouragement to rejoice in its gifts while they are within grasp.
NABRE,21,11,10,"[4] Fleeting: lit., ""vanity."""
NABRE,21,12,1,"[1] 12:1-7 The homage to life of <a href='/NABRE/21/11/7'>11:7-10</a> is deliberately balanced by the sombre yet shimmering radiance of this poem on old age and death. The poems enigmatic imagery has often been interpreted allegorically, especially in vv. <a href='/NABRE/21/12/3'>3-5</a>. Above all it seeks to evoke an atmosphere as well as an attitude toward death and old age."
NABRE,21,12,3,"[2] 12:3-5 An allegorical reading of these verses sees references to the human body—""guardians"": the arms; ""strong men"": the legs; ""women who grind"": the teeth; ""those who look"": the eyes; ""the doors"": the lips; ""daughters of song"": the voice; ""the almond tree blooms"": resembling the white hair of old age; ""the locust…sluggish"": the stiffness in movement of the aged; ""the caper berry"": a stimulant for appetite."
NABRE,21,12,6,"[3] The golden bowl suspended by the silver cord is a symbol of life; the snapping of the cord and the breaking of the bowl, a symbol of death. The pitcher…the pulley: another pair of metaphors for life and its ending."
NABRE,21,12,7,"[4] Death is portrayed in terms of the description of creation in <a href='/NABRE/1/2/7'>GEN 2:7</a>; the body corrupts in the grave, and the life breath (lit., ""spirit""), or gift of life, returns to God who had breathed upon what he had formed."
NABRE,21,12,9,[5] A disciple briefly describes and praises the masters skill and reputation as a sage.
NABRE,21,12,11,"[6] One shepherd: perhaps referring to the books author, who gathers or ""shepherds"" together its contents. God could also be ""the one shepherd,"" the ultimate depository and source of true wisdom."
NABRE,21,12,12,[7] As to more than these: the words seem to refer to the writings of Ecclesiastes and other sages. They are adequate and sufficient; any more involves exhaustive labor.
NABRE,21,12,13,"[8] 12:13-14 These words reaffirm traditional wisdom doctrine such as fear of God and faithful obedience, perhaps lest some of the more extreme statements of the author be misunderstood. Although the epilogue has been interpreted as a criticism of the books author, it is really a summary that betrays the unruffled spirit of later sages, who were not shocked by Qoheleths statements. They honored him as a hakamor sage (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/12/9'>9</a>), even as they preserved his statements about the futility of life (v. <a href='/NABRE/21/12/8'>8</a>), and the mystery of divine judgment (<a href='/NABRE/21/8/17'>8:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/11/5'>11:5</a>)."
NABRE,22,1,1,"[1] Song of Songs: in Hebrew and Aramaic the idiom ""the X of Xs"" denotes the superlative (e.g., ""king of kings"" = ""the highest king""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/10/17'>DEU 10:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/1/2'>ECC 1:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/12/8'>12:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/15/7/12'>EZR 7:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/2/37'>DAN 2:37</a>). The ascription of authorship to Solomon is traditional. The heading may also mean ""for Solomon"" or ""about Solomon."""
NABRE,22,1,2,"[2] 1:2-8:14 This translation augments the canonical text of the Song with the letters W, M, and D, placed in the margin, to indicate which of the characters in the Song is speaking: the woman, the man, or the ""Daughters of Jerusalem."" This interpretive gloss follows an early Christian scribal practice, attested in some Septuagint manuscripts from the first half of the first millennium A.D."
NABRE,22,1,2,"[3] 1:2-7 The woman and her female chorus address the man, here viewed as king and shepherd (both are familiar metaphors for God; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/23/1'>PS 23:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/40/11'>ISA 40:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/10/1'>JHN 10:1-16</a>). There is a wordplay between ""kiss"" (Hebrew nashaq) and ""drink"" (shaqah), anticipating <a href='/NABRE/22/8/1'>8:1-2</a>. The change from third person (""let him kiss…"") to second person (""…for your love…"") is not uncommon in the Song and elsewhere (<a href='/NABRE/22/1/4'>1:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/2/4'>2:4</a>; etc.; <a href='/NABRE/19/23/1'>PS 23:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/23/4'>4-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/23/6'>6</a>; etc.) and reflects the womans move from interior monologue to direct address to her partner."
NABRE,22,1,3,[4] Your perfumes: shemen(perfume) is a play on shem(name).
NABRE,22,1,4,"[5] Another change, but from second to third person (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/1/2'>1:2</a>). The ""king"" metaphor recurs in <a href='/NABRE/22/1/12'>1:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/3/5'>3:5-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/7/6'>7:6</a>. Let us exult: perhaps she is addressing young women, calling on them to join in the praise of her lover."
NABRE,22,1,5,"[6] Daughters of Jerusalem: the woman contrasts herself with the elite city women, who act as her female ""chorus"" (<a href='/NABRE/22/5/9'>5:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/6/1'>6:1</a>). Qedar: a Syrian desert region whose name suggests darkness; tents were often made of black goat hair. Curtains: tent coverings, or tapestries. Solomon: it could also be read Salma, a region close to Qedar."
NABRE,22,1,6,"[7] So black: tanned from working outdoors in her brothers vineyards, unlike the city women she addresses. My own vineyard: perhaps the woman herself; see <a href='/NABRE/22/8/8'>8:8-10</a> for her relationship to her brothers."
NABRE,22,1,7,"[8] Shepherd: a common metaphor for kings. Here and elsewhere in the Song (<a href='/NABRE/22/3/1'>3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/5/8'>5:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/6/1'>6:1</a>), the woman expresses her desire to be in the company of her lover. The search for the lover and her failure to find him create a degree of tension. Only at the end (<a href='/NABRE/22/8/5'>8:5-14</a>) do the lovers finally possess each other."
NABRE,22,1,8,[9] Pasture your lambs: both the woman and the man act as shepherds in the Song.
NABRE,22,1,9,"[10] 1:9-11 The man compares the womans beauty to the rich adornment of the royal chariot of Pharaoh. My friend: a special feminine form of the word ""friend,"" appearing only in the Song (<a href='/NABRE/22/1/15'>1:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/2/2'>2:2, 10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/22/2/13'>13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/4/1'>4:1, 7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/5/2'>5:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/6/4'>6:4</a>) and used to express endearment and equality in love. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/3/1'>HOS 3:1</a> for the use of the masculine form of the term in a context with sexual overtones."
NABRE,22,1,12,"[11] Spikenard: a precious perfumed ointment from India; in <a href='/NABRE/22/4/13'>4:13-14</a>, a metaphor for the woman herself."
NABRE,22,1,13,"[12] My lover: the womans favorite term for her partner (used twenty-seven times). Myrrh: an aromatic resin of balsam or roses used in cosmetics, incense, and medicines."
NABRE,22,1,14,"[13] Henna: a plant which bears white scented flowers, used in cosmetics and medicines. En-gedi: a Judean desert oasis overlooking the Dead Sea."
NABRE,22,1,15,[14] Doves: doves are pictured in the ancient world as messengers of love.
NABRE,22,1,16,"[15] 1:16-17 Continuing the royal metaphor, the meeting place of the lovers, a shepherds hut of green branches, becomes a palace with beams of cedar and rafters of cypress when adorned with their love."
NABRE,22,2,1,"[1] Flower of Sharon: probably the narcissus, which grows in the fertile Plain of Sharon lying between Mount Carmel and Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast. Lily: the lotus plant."
NABRE,22,2,3,"[2] Shadow: suggestive of protection (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/9/15'>JUG 9:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/17/23'>EZE 17:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/17/8'>PS 17:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/121/5'>121:5</a>) and, here, of the womans joy in the presence of her lover."
NABRE,22,2,4,"[3] 2:4-6 The banquet hall: the sweet things of the table, the embrace of the woman and man, express the richness of their affection and the intimacy of their love."
NABRE,22,2,5,[4] Raisin cakes: perhaps pastries used in the worship of the fertility goddess (cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/3/1'>HOS 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/18'>JER 7:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/44/19'>44:19</a>). Apples: this is the common translation of a fruit that cannot be identified (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/2/3'>2:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/8/5'>8:5</a>); it appears frequently in Sumerian love poetry associated with the worship of the goddess Inanna. Sick: love-sickness is a popular motif in ancient love poetry.
NABRE,22,2,7,[5] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/3/5'>3:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/5/8'>5:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/8/4'>8:4</a>. By the gazelles and the does: perhaps a mitigated invocation of the divinity based on the assonance in Hebrew of the names of these animals with terms for God.
NABRE,22,2,8,"[6] 2:8-13 In this sudden change of scene, the woman describes a rendezvous and pictures her lover hastening toward her dwelling until his voice is heard calling her to him."
NABRE,22,2,9,[7] Gazelle: a frequent motif in ancient poems from Mesopotamia.
NABRE,22,2,14,[8] The woman is addressed as though she were a dove in a mountain cleft out of sight and reach.
NABRE,22,2,15,"[9] A snatch of song in answer to the request of <a href='/NABRE/22/2/14'>2:14</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/13'>8:13-14</a>. Foxes: they threaten to disturb the security of vineyards. The vineyards are women sought after by young lovers, i.e., foxes."
NABRE,22,2,17,"[10] Grows cool: in the evening when the sun is going down. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/3/8'>GEN 3:8</a>. Rugged: Hebrew obscure; some interpret it as a geographical name; others, in the sense of spices (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/14'>8:14</a>); still others, of sacrifice (<a href='/NABRE/1/15/10'>GEN 15:10</a>); the image probably refers here to the woman herself."
NABRE,22,3,1,[1] 3:1-5 See the parallel in <a href='/NABRE/22/5/2'>5:2-8</a>.
NABRE,22,3,2,[2] The motif of seeking/finding here and elsewhere is used by later Christian and Jewish mystics to speak of the souls search for the divine.
NABRE,22,3,4,"[3] Whom my soul loves: the fourfold repetition of this phrase in vv. <a href='/NABRE/22/3/1'>1-4</a> highlights the depth of the womans emotion and desire. Mothers house: cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/2'>8:2</a>; a place of safety and intimacy, one which implicitly signifies approval of the lovers relationship."
NABRE,22,3,6,"[4] 3:6-11 This may be an independent poem. In context it portrays the lover as King Solomon, escorted by sixty armed men, coming in royal procession to meet a bride."
NABRE,22,3,8,"[5] Terrors: cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/91/5'>PS 91:5</a>; perhaps bandits lying in wait, unidentified dangers lurking in darkness."
NABRE,22,3,10,"[6] Lovingly fitted: translation uncertain. The phrase ""Daughters of Jerusalem"" is read here with the following verse."
NABRE,22,4,1,"[1] This section (vv. <a href='/NABRE/22/4/1'>1-7</a>) begins a wasf, a traditional poetic form describing the physical attributes of ones partner in terms of the natural world (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/5/10'>5:10-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/6/5'>6:5b-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/7/1'>7:1-7</a>). Veil: women of the region customarily veiled their faces for some occasions (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/4/3'>4:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/6/7'>6:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/24/65'>GEN 24:65-67</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/38/14'>38:14-19</a>)."
NABRE,22,4,2,[2] Teeth: praised for whiteness and evenness.
NABRE,22,4,3,"[3] Pomegranate: a fruit with a firm skin and deep red color. The womans cheek (or perhaps her brow) is compared, in roundness and tint, to a half-pomegranate."
NABRE,22,4,4,[4] The ornaments about her neck are compared to the trophies and armaments on the city walls. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/10/10'>1KG 10:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/14/26'>14:26-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/27/10'>EZE 27:10</a>.
NABRE,22,4,6,[5] Mountain of myrrh…hill of frankincense: spoken figuratively of the woman; cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/14'>8:14</a>.
NABRE,22,4,7,[6] Cf. the description of the church in <a href='/NABRE/49/5/27'>EPH 5:27</a>.
NABRE,22,4,8,[7] Amana…Senir and Hermon: these rugged heights symbolize obstacles that would separate the lovers; cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/2/14'>2:14</a>.
NABRE,22,4,9,"[8] Sister: a term of endearment; brother-sister language forms part of the conventional language of love used in this canticle, the Book of Tobit, and elsewhere in poetry from Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Syro-Palestine."
NABRE,22,4,11,"[9] Honey: sweet words (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/3'>PRO 5:3</a>) or perhaps kisses (<a href='/NABRE/22/1/2'>1:2-3</a>). Honey and milk: familiar descriptions for the fertile promised land (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/8'>EXO 3:8, 17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/20/24'>LEV 20:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/13/27'>NUM 13:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/6/3'>DEU 6:3</a>)."
NABRE,22,4,12,"[10] Garden enclosed…fountain sealed: reserved for the lover alone. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/5/15'>PRO 5:15-19</a> for similar images used to describe fruitful, committed relationship."
NABRE,22,4,14,[11] These plants are all known for their sweet fragrance.
NABRE,22,4,16,"[12] Awake: the same verb is used of love in <a href='/NABRE/22/3/5'>3:5</a>. The woman may be the speaker of 16a, as it is she who issues the invitation of 16b. His garden: the woman herself."
NABRE,22,5,1,[1] Eat…lovers: the translation and meaning are uncertain.
NABRE,22,5,2,[2] 5:2-8 An experience of anticipation and loss similar to that in <a href='/NABRE/22/3/1'>3:1-5</a>. The lovers abrupt appearance resembles that in <a href='/NABRE/22/2/8'>2:8-9</a>.
NABRE,22,5,3,"[3] Robe: knee-length undergarment worn by men and women. Am I then…?: the womans refusal is a form of gentle teasing; that she does not really reject her lover is shown by her actions in vv. <a href='/NABRE/22/5/5'>5-6</a>. See <a href='/NABRE/22/1/7'>1:7-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/2/14'>2:14-15</a>, for other teasing interchanges."
NABRE,22,5,4,"[4] My innermost being: lit., ""innards."" In <a href='/NABRE/1/25/23'>GEN 25:23</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/49/1'>ISA 49:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/71/6'>PS 71:6</a>, the word appears to carry the meaning of ""womb."""
NABRE,22,5,6,[5] The motif of the locked-out lover is common in classical Greek and Latin poetry.
NABRE,22,5,7,[6] The watchmen: they do not know the reason for the womans appearance in the city streets; cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/3/2'>3:2-4</a>.
NABRE,22,5,10,"[7] 5:10-11 In answer to the question of <a href='/NABRE/22/5/9'>5:9</a> the woman sings her lovers praises (vv. <a href='/NABRE/22/5/10'>10-16</a>). Ruddy: also used of David (<a href='/NABRE/9/16/12'>1SM 16:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/17/42'>17:42</a>). Gold: indicates how precious the lover is. Palm fronds: his thick, luxuriant growth of hair."
NABRE,22,5,12,"[8] Sitting…: the translation of this line is uncertain; it may continue the metaphor of the lovers eyes, or refer to another part of his anatomy (e.g., teeth) which has been omitted from the text."
NABRE,22,6,1,"[1] The Daughters of Jerusalem are won by this description of the lover and offer their aid in seeking him (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/5/6'>5:6, 9</a>)."
NABRE,22,6,2,"[2] 6:2-3 The woman implies here that she had never really lost her lover, for he has come down to his garden (cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/2/16'>2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/4/5'>4:5</a>). Feed…lilies: the imagery here evokes both a shepherd pasturing his flocks and erotic play between the lovers (<a href='/NABRE/22/2/16'>2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/4/5'>4:5, 12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/22/4/16'>16</a>)."
NABRE,22,6,4,"[3] 6:4-9 The man again celebrates the womans beauty. Tirzah: probably meaning ""pleasant""; it was the early capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/11/16/1'>1KG 16</a>). Celestial visions: the meaning is uncertain. Military images may be implied here, i.e., the ""heavenly hosts"" who fight along with God on Israels behalf (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/5/20'>JUG 5:20</a>), or perhaps a reference to the awesome goddesses of the region who combined aspects of both fertility and war."
NABRE,22,6,9,[4] One alone: the incomparability of the woman is a favorite motif in love poetry.
NABRE,22,6,10,"[5] ""Who…"": the speakers may be the women of vv. <a href='/NABRE/22/6/8'>8-9</a>. Moon…sun: lit., ""the white"" and ""the hot,"" respectively (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/24/23'>ISA 24:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/26'>30:26</a>). Fearsome: see note on <a href='/NABRE/22/6/4'>6:4-9</a>."
NABRE,22,6,11,[6] Walnut grove: also a site of activity in a wedding hymn of the Syrian moon goddess Nikkal (cf. the woman compared to the moon in v. <a href='/NABRE/22/6/10'>10</a>).
NABRE,22,6,12,"[7] The text is obscure in Hebrew and in the ancient versions. The Vulgate reads: ""I did not know; my soul disturbed me because of the chariots of Aminadab."" Based on a parallel in <a href='/NABRE/7/5/24'>JUG 5:24</a>, ""chariots"" is here emended to ""blessed one."""
NABRE,22,7,1,"[1] Shulammite: the woman is so designated because she is considered to be from Shulam (or Shunem) in the plain of Esdraelon (cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/1/3'>1KG 1:3</a>), or because the name may mean ""the peaceful one,"" and thus recall the name of Solomon. Turn: she is asked to face the speaker(s). How…: she refuses to be regarded as a spectacle (""the dance of the two camps"" is unknown). Some interpret the episode as an invitation to her to dance."
NABRE,22,7,2,"[2] 7:2-6 Another description of the womans charms. Sandals: the womans sandaled foot was apparently considered quite seductive (<a href='/NABRE/69/16/9'>JUDI 16:9</a>). Noble: a possible connection to the enigmatic ""prince"" of <a href='/NABRE/22/6/12'>6:12</a>. Curving…jewels: the meaning of these Hebrew words is not certain. Wine and wheat suggest fertility."
NABRE,22,7,3,"[3] Valley: lit., navel; a discreet allusion to her sex."
NABRE,22,7,5,"[4] The comparison emphasizes the stateliness of her neck, and the clarity of her eyes. Bath-rabbim: a proper name which occurs only here; there was a city of Rabbah northeast of Heshbon in Transjordan. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/49/3'>JER 49:3</a>."
NABRE,22,7,6,[5] Carmel: a prominent set of cliffs overlooking the Mediterranean.
NABRE,22,7,8,[6] 7:8-9 Date-palm: a figure of stateliness. The lover is eager to enjoy the possession of his beloved.
NABRE,22,7,10,"[7] Gliding: the beloved interrupts her partners compliment by referring to the intoxication of their union. The translation rests on an emendation of the enigmatic ""the lips of the sleepers."""
NABRE,22,7,11,"[8] 7:11-14 The womans answer assures him of her love, and invites him to return with her to the rural delights associated with their love (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/22/6/11'>6:11-12</a>). Yearning: used only here and in <a href='/NABRE/1/3/16'>GEN 3:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/4/7'>4:7</a>. The dependency and subordination of woman to man presented as a consequence of sin in the Genesis story is here transcended in the mutuality of true love."
NABRE,22,7,14,[9] Mandrakes: herbs believed to have power to arouse love and promote fertility; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/30/14'>GEN 30:14-16</a>.
NABRE,22,8,2,"[1] Wine…pomegranate: sexual connotations are implied, since the root ""drink"" (shaqah) is a wordplay on ""kiss"" (nashaq) in v. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/1'>1</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/22/1/2'>1:2</a>."
NABRE,22,8,5,"[2] Awakened you: the speakers in this verse are difficult to identify. Someone (the poet? Daughters?) hails the couple in v. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/5'>5a</a>. According to the Masoretic vocalization, the woman is the speaker in v. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/5'>5b</a>."
NABRE,22,8,6,"[3] Seal: this could be worn bound to the arm, as here, or suspended at the neck, or as a ring (<a href='/NABRE/24/22/24'>JER 22:24</a>). It was used for identification and signatures. Strong…fierce: in human experience, Death and Sheol are inevitable, unrelenting; in the end they always triumph. Love, which is just as certain of its victory, matches its strength against the natural enemies of life; waters cannot extinguish it nor floods carry it away. It is more priceless than all riches. Flames of the divine: the Hebrew is difficult: the short form (-Yah) of the divine name Yhwh found here may associate love with the Lord, or it may be acting as a superlative—i.e., god-sized flames."
NABRE,22,8,7,"[4] Deep waters: often used to designate chaos (<a href='/NABRE/19/93/4'>PS 93:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/144/7'>144:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/17/12'>ISA 17:12-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/35/3/15'>HAB 3:15</a>). The fires of love cannot be extinguished, even by waters of chaos. Wealth: love cannot be bought."
NABRE,22,8,8,"[5] 8:8-9 The woman quotes the course of action her elder brothers had decided on. While she is yet immature, they will shelter her in view of eventual marriage. Wall…door: if she is virtuous, she will be honored; if she is not, she will be kept under strict vigilance. Silver turret: a precious ornament."
NABRE,22,8,10,"[6] In reply to the officious and meddling attitude of the brothers, she answers with their terms: she is mature (""wall,"" ""towers""). Brings peace: or, ""finds peace."""
NABRE,22,8,11,"[7] 8:11-12 These enigmatic verses have been variously interpreted, depending on who is taken to be the speaker. In v. <a href='/NABRE/22/8/11'>11</a>, if the woman, she boasts that she is a vineyard of great value. If the man, he boasts over his possession of her."
NABRE,22,8,13,"[8] 8:13-14 As in <a href='/NABRE/22/2/14'>2:14</a>, her lover asks for a word or a song and she replies in words similar to those found in <a href='/NABRE/22/2/17'>2:17</a>."
NABRE,70,1,1,"[1] 1:1-6:21 The reward is the gift of immortality, to the righteous (<a href='/NABRE/70/1/15'>1:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/3/1'>3:1-3</a>), but not to the wicked (<a href='/NABRE/70/5/1'>5:1-13</a>). Contrasts between these two groups dominate chaps. <a href='/NABRE/70/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/5/1'>5</a>. The philosophy of the wicked and their persecution of the righteous are dramatically presented in <a href='/NABRE/70/1/16'>1:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/2/24'>2:24</a>. New light is shed on the suffering of the righteous (<a href='/NABRE/70/3/1'>3:1-9</a>), childlessness (<a href='/NABRE/70/3/13'>3:13-15</a>), and premature death (<a href='/NABRE/70/4/7'>4:7-16</a>)—in contrast to the fate of the wicked (<a href='/NABRE/70/3/10'>3:10-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/70/3/16'>16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/4/3'>4:3-6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/70/4/17'>17-20</a>)."
NABRE,70,1,1,"[2] Righteousness: not merely the cardinal virtue of justice (cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/8/7'>8:7</a>), but the universal moral quality which is the application of wisdom to moral conduct. You who judge: ""judges"" and ""kings"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/6/1'>6:1</a>) are addressed in accordance with the literary customs of the times and with the putative Solomonic authorship, but the real audience is the Jewish community."
NABRE,70,1,4,[3] In these verses personified Wisdom is identified with the spirit of the Lord; so also in <a href='/NABRE/70/9/17'>9:17</a>.
NABRE,70,1,5,"[4] Discipline: here and elsewhere, another name for Wisdom."
NABRE,70,1,11,[5] Calumny: speech against God and divine providence is meant.
NABRE,70,1,12,"[6] Death: as will become clear, the author is not speaking of physical death but of spiritual death, the eternal separation from God."
NABRE,70,1,14,"[7] Hades: the Greek term for the Hebrew Sheol, the dwelling place of the dead."
NABRE,70,1,15,[8] Undying: immortality is not seen as an innate quality of the soul but as a gift of God to the righteous.
NABRE,70,2,1,[1] 2:1-20 In this speech the wicked deny survival after death and indeed invite death by their evil deeds.
NABRE,70,2,12,"[2] 2:12-5:23 From <a href='/NABRE/70/2/12'>2:12</a> to <a href='/NABRE/70/5/23'>5:23</a> the author draws heavily on <a href='/NABRE/23/52/1'>ISA 52</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/62/1'>62</a>, setting forth his teaching in a series of characters or types taken from Isaiah and embellished with additional details from other texts. The description of the ""righteous one"" in <a href='/NABRE/70/2/12'>2:12-20</a> seems to undergird the New Testament passion narrative."
NABRE,70,2,12,"[3] Law: the law of Moses; ""training"" has the same meaning."
NABRE,70,2,22,[4] This verse announces the subject of the next section.
NABRE,70,2,24,[5] Envy: perhaps because Adam was in the image of God or because Adam had control over all creation. Devil: the first biblical text to equate the serpent of <a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>GEN 3</a> with the devil.
NABRE,70,3,1,"[1] 3:1-4:19 The central section of chaps. <a href='/NABRE/70/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/6/1'>6</a>. The author begins by stating that immortality is the reward of the righteous, and then in the light of that belief comments on three points of the traditional discussion of the problem of retribution (suffering, childlessness, early death) each of which was often seen as a divine punishment."
NABRE,70,3,1,"[2] 3:1-12 The author affirms that, for the righteous, sufferings are not punishments but purification and opportunities to show fidelity, whereas for the wicked suffering is truly a punishment."
NABRE,70,3,6,"[3] Offerings: the image is that of the burnt offering, in which the victim is completely consumed by fire."
NABRE,70,3,7,[4] Judgment: the Greek episkopēis Gods loving judgment of those who have been faithful to him; the same word is used in <a href='/NABRE/70/14/11'>14:11</a> for the punishment of the wicked at Gods judgment. Cf. also v. <a href='/NABRE/70/3/13'>13</a>.
NABRE,70,3,10,[5] To match their thoughts: a fate as empty as that which they describe in <a href='/NABRE/70/2/1'>2:1-5</a>.
NABRE,70,3,13,[6] 3:13-4:6 The true fruit of life is not children but virtue which leads to immortality. The many children of the wicked will be a disappointing fruit.
NABRE,70,3,13,[7] See vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/3/7'>7-9</a>.
NABRE,70,3,14,[8] Fidelitys choice reward: cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/1'>ISA 56:1-8</a>. More gratifying: better than sons and daughters; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/5'>ISA 56:5</a>.
NABRE,70,3,15,[9] Root of understanding: the root that is understanding (wisdom).
NABRE,70,3,16,[10] Adulterers: understood here as a type of sinners in general; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/3'>ISA 57:3-5</a>.
NABRE,70,4,7,"[1] 4:7-19 Early death is not a punishment for the righteous because genuine old age is the attainment of perfection and early death is a preservation from corruption. The old age and death of the wicked, however, will not be honorable."
NABRE,70,4,10,"[2] 4:10-11 There are allusions here to Enoch (<a href='/NABRE/1/5/21'>GEN 5:21-24</a>), who was young by patriarchal standards, and to Lot (<a href='/NABRE/1/19/10'>GEN 19:10-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/61/2/7'>2PE 2:7-8</a>). Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/23/57/1'>ISA 57:1-2</a>."
NABRE,70,4,14,[3] Verse 15 is omitted because it repeats the last two lines of <a href='/NABRE/70/3/9'>3:9</a>.
NABRE,70,5,1,[1] 5:1-13 In contrast to their speech in chap. <a href='/NABRE/70/2/1'>2</a> the wicked now regret their assessment of life and righteousness.
NABRE,70,5,5,"[2] Heavenly beings: lit., ""sons of God."" These are the holy ones, members of the heavenly court, among whom the righteous are to be found. A bodily resurrection does not seem to be envisioned."
NABRE,70,5,14,[3] 5:14-23 A picture of the reward of the righteous which develops into an apocalyptic description of the divine warriors destruction of evil. The author utilizes <a href='/NABRE/23/59/1'>ISA 59</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/62/1'>62</a>.
NABRE,70,6,1,"[1] 6:1-21 The first part of the book closes with an exhortation comparable to <a href='/NABRE/70/1/1'>1:1-15</a>, and it leads into ""Solomons"" personal comments on wisdom in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/70/7/1'>7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/9/1'>9</a>."
NABRE,70,6,1,"[2] Kings…magistrates: note the inclusion with v. <a href='/NABRE/70/6/21'>21</a> (""kings""). The address to earthly powers is in accord with the opening (<a href='/NABRE/70/1/1'>1:1</a>), but the true audience remains the Jewish community."

NABRE,70,6,17,"[5] 6:17-20 This type of reasoning approximates the rhetorical sorites, a series of statements in which the predicate of each becomes the subject of the next. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/5/3'>ROM 5:3-5</a>."
NABRE,70,6,22,"[6] 6:22-9:18 In these verses the author identifies with Solomon (without mentioning that name anywhere), and praises the beauty of Wisdom, describing how he sought her out. Thus the readers of the book can find a model in their search for Wisdom."
NABRE,70,7,1,[1] First one formed of earth: Adam. The author omits throughout the book the proper names of the characters in sacred history of whom he speaks; see especially chap. <a href='/NABRE/70/10/1'>10</a>.
NABRE,70,7,2,[2] In a ten-month period: ten lunar months.
NABRE,70,7,12,"[3] Mother: lit., ""she who begets."" Although Wisdom herself is begotten of God (<a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>PRO 8:22-24</a>), she is here the one who brings into being."
NABRE,70,7,14,[4] Discipline: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/70/1/5'>1:5</a>.
NABRE,70,7,17,"[5] 7:17-22a Wisdom teaches not only righteousness and friendship with God but also sound knowledge of the world, the universe, plants, animals and human beings. See also <a href='/NABRE/11/5/9'>1KG 5:9-14</a>; these specialties reflect Hellenistic culture."
NABRE,70,7,22,"[6] 7:22b-23 The twenty-one (7 × 3) attributes of the spirit in Wisdom reflect the influence of contemporary philosophy, especially the Stoa, but the personification rests also on <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>PRO 8:22-31</a> and Sir 24."
NABRE,70,7,25,[7] 7:25-26 Five strong metaphors underline the origins and closeness of Wisdom with God. See the use of this language in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/3'>HEB 1:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/1/15'>COL 1:15</a>.
NABRE,70,8,2,"[1] I loved…my bride: the erotic quality in the pursuit of and living with Woman Wisdom, who is the Lords consort (<a href='/NABRE/70/9/4'>9:4</a>) and loved by him, continues throughout this chapter (vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/8/16'>16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/70/8/18'>18</a>). It is reflected already in <a href='/NABRE/20/4/5'>PRO 4:5-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/7/4'>7:4-5</a>. See also <a href='/NABRE/71/15/2'>SIR 15:2-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/51/13'>51:13-21</a>."
NABRE,70,8,7,"[2] Moderation…fortitude: known also as the cardinal virtues, and recognized in Greek philosophy (Plato)."
NABRE,70,8,12,[3] Hands upon their mouths: a sign of respect for unanswerable wisdom; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/40/4'>JOB 40:4</a>.
NABRE,70,8,19,"[4] 8:19-20 Here the author mentions first bodily, then spiritual, excellence. To make it plain that the latter is the governing factor in the harmonious development of the human person, he then reverses the order. The Platonic doctrine of the pre-existence of the soul is often read into these lines, but such an anthropology does not seem to be the intent of the author (cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/7/1'>7:1-6</a>). Verse 20 appears to rule out any misunderstanding of v. <a href='/NABRE/70/8/19'>19</a>. Verse 21 emphasizes that he did not bring talent to his ""birth""; his wisdom is the gift of God."
NABRE,70,9,1,[1] 9:1-18 The author presents his version of Solomons prayer (<a href='/NABRE/11/3/6'>1KG 3:6-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/1/8'>2CH 1:8-10</a>).
NABRE,70,9,1,[2] 9:1-2 The author identifies Wisdom with the word of God just as he again identifies Wisdom with the spirit of God in v. <a href='/NABRE/70/9/17'>17</a>. All three are alternate ways of expressing Gods activity in relationship with the world and its inhabitants.
NABRE,70,9,15,"[3] 9:15-17 Although the expressions in v. <a href='/NABRE/70/9/15'>15</a> draw on the language of Plato concerning the human condition, the conclusion is very biblical: God remains a mystery (<a href='/NABRE/18/38/1'>JOB 38</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/39/1'>39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/8/17'>ECC 8:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/40/12'>ISA 40:12-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/11/33'>ROM 11:33-34</a>). The plight of humankind is clearly one of ignorance, unless the ""holy spirit"" is sent from God."

NABRE,70,11,2,[1] 11:2-19:22 Few verses in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/70/11/1'>11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/19/1'>19</a> can be fully understood without consulting the passages in the Pentateuch which are indicated in the cross-references. The theme of this part of the book is expressed in v. <a href='/NABRE/70/11/5'>5</a> and is illustrated in the following chapters by five examples drawn from Exodus events.
NABRE,70,11,6,[2] 11:6-8 River: the Nile; the contrast is between the first plague of Egypt (<a href='/NABRE/2/7/17'>EXO 7:17-24</a>) and the water drawn from the rock in Horeb (<a href='/NABRE/2/17/5'>EXO 17:5-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/20/8'>NUM 20:8-11</a>).
NABRE,70,11,12,[3] Twofold grief: the double distress described in vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/11/13'>13-14</a>.
NABRE,70,11,15,"[4] Dumb: that is, irrational."
NABRE,70,11,17,[5] Formless matter: a Greek philosophical concept is used to interpret the chaos of <a href='/NABRE/1/1/2'>GEN 1:2</a>.
NABRE,70,11,22,[6] Grain from a balance: a tiny particle used for weighing on sensitive scales.
NABRE,70,11,23,"[7] The combination of divine mercy and power is an unusual paradox, but cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/12/15'>12:15-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/62/12'>PS 62:12-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/2/18'>SIR 2:18</a>. The main emphasis is on a creating that is motivated by love; the divine ""imperishable spirit"" (either Wisdom as in <a href='/NABRE/70/1/4'>1:4, 7</a>, or perhaps the breath of life as in <a href='/NABRE/1/2/7'>GEN 2:7</a>) is in everything (<a href='/NABRE/70/12/1'>12:1</a>)."
NABRE,70,12,5,[1] The horrible crimes here attributed to the Canaanites (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/70/14/23'>14:23</a>) were not unheard of in the ancient world.
NABRE,70,12,17,"[2] The brunt of divine anger and justice is borne by those who know God but defy divine authority and might. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/1/2'>1:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/15/2'>15:2</a>, but also <a href='/NABRE/70/12/27'>12:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/18/13'>18:13</a>."
NABRE,70,12,27,[3] Condemnation: the death of Egyptian firstborn and the destruction of their army in the sea.
NABRE,70,13,1,"[1] 13:1-9 The author holds a relatively benign view of the efforts of the philosophers to come to know God from various natural phenomena. This is not a question of proving the existence of God in scholastic style. The author thinks that the beauty and might of the world should have pointed by analogy (v. <a href='/NABRE/70/13/5'>5</a>) to the Maker. Instead, those ""in ignorance of God"" remained fixed on the elements (v. <a href='/NABRE/70/13/2'>2</a>, three named, along with the stars). His Greek counterparts are not totally blameless; they should have gone further and acknowledged the creator of natures wonders (vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/13/4'>4-5</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/18'>ROM 1:18-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/17/27'>ACT 17:27-28</a>."
NABRE,70,13,1,[2] One who is: this follows the Greek translation of the sacred name for God in Hebrew; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/14'>EXO 3:14</a>.
NABRE,70,13,2,[3] Governors: the sun and moon (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/16'>GEN 1:16</a>).
NABRE,70,13,6,[4] The blame is less: the greater blame is incurred by those mentioned in v. <a href='/NABRE/70/13/10'>10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/15/14'>15:14-16</a>.
NABRE,70,13,10,"[5] 13:10-19 The second digression is an example of the polemic against idolatry (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/44/9'>ISA 44:9-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/10/3'>JER 10:3-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/135/15'>PS 135:15-18</a>). Whether the idols be of wood or clay, they were made by human beings and have become the source of evil."
NABRE,70,14,3,"[1] 14:3-6 The wooden ship mentioned in vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/14/1'>1-2</a> prompts a short meditation on the providence of God, who in fact has watched over boats in their dangerous courses. The wood as described in v. <a href='/NABRE/70/14/7'>7</a> became a favorite patristic type for the wood of the cross."
NABRE,70,14,6,[2] Noah.
NABRE,70,14,15,"[3] 14:15-21 The author develops two examples of idolatry: cult of the dead, and cult of the king."
NABRE,70,14,19,[4] Likeness: he made this more flattering than the reality.
NABRE,70,14,30,[5] Piety: the sanctity of oaths.
NABRE,70,14,31,[6] Perjury is a form of deceit which calls for punishment even though it be practiced in the name of a lifeless idol.
NABRE,70,15,1,"[1] 15:1-3 As often before (<a href='/NABRE/70/11/26'>11:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/12/2'>12:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/14/3'>14:3-6</a>), the author addresses God directly, so that chaps. <a href='/NABRE/70/11/1'>11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/19/1'>19</a> can be conceived as a more or less continuous prayer (cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/11/7'>11:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/19/22'>19:22</a>). This is the living God who is in stark contrast to the deadness of the idols that have been discussed. The merciful God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/34/6'>EXO 34:6</a>) is the source of immortality (<a href='/NABRE/70/1/15'>1:15</a>) for the community."
NABRE,70,15,8,[2] 15:8-9 The author matches the irony of his words about the carpenter in <a href='/NABRE/70/13/15'>13:15-19</a> with this description of the potters vain work.
NABRE,70,15,10,[3] Ashes his heart is!: the words of this cry are taken from <a href='/NABRE/23/44/20'>ISA 44:20</a> (the Septuagint).
NABRE,70,15,18,"[4] 15:18-19 The author here returns (<a href='/NABRE/70/11/15'>11:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/12/23'>12:23-27</a>) to the main theme of chaps. <a href='/NABRE/70/11/1'>11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/19/1'>19</a>, which was interrupted by the digression of <a href='/NABRE/70/13/1'>13:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/15/17'>15:17</a>."
NABRE,70,15,18,"[5] Worse than the rest: this may mean that the creatures worshiped by the Egyptians (e.g., crocodiles, serpents, scarabs, etc.) were less intelligent than the general run of beasts."
NABRE,70,16,1,"[1] They: the Egyptian idolaters, who are punished according to the principle laid down in <a href='/NABRE/70/11/5'>11:5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/70/11/15'>15-16</a>."
NABRE,70,16,6,"[2] Sign: the brazen serpent, as related in <a href='/NABRE/4/21/1'>NUM 21</a>, but the author deliberately avoids any misunderstanding by addressing the Lord as responsible for the healing, since he is ""the savior of all"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/70/16/7'>7</a>; see also vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/16/12'>12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/70/16/26'>26</a> for the role of the ""word"" of God)."
NABRE,70,16,13,"[3] 16:13-14 The author recognizes the power of the Lord over life and death, as expressed in <a href='/NABRE/9/2/6'>1SM 2:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/13/2'>TOB 13:2</a>. The traditional imagery of Sheol (gates and confinement) colors the passage."
NABRE,70,16,20,"[4] Food of angels: the famous phrase (cf. the hymn ""Panis Angelicus"") is taken from <a href='/NABRE/19/78/24'>PS 78:24</a> as rendered by the Septuagint. The ""bread from heaven"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/16/4'>EXO 16:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/105/40'>PS 105:40</a>) with its marvelous ""sweetness"" becomes a type of the ""bread come down from heaven"" in <a href='/NABRE/43/6/32'>JHN 6:32-51</a>, and plays a large role in later Christian devotion."
NABRE,70,16,22,[5] Snow and ice: the manna; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/70/16/27'>27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/19/21'>19:21</a>.
NABRE,70,17,1,"[1] 17:1-18:4 The description of the darkness of the ninth plague is a very creative development of <a href='/NABRE/2/10/21'>EXO 10:21-29</a>. It betrays a wide knowledge of contemporary thought. For the first and only time in the Septuagint the Greek word for ""conscience"" occurs, in <a href='/NABRE/70/17/11'>17:11</a>. There is no Hebrew word that is equivalent; the idea is expressed indirectly. The horrendous darkness is illumined by ""fires"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/70/17/6'>6</a>), i.e., lightnings that only contributed to the terror."
NABRE,70,17,7,"[2] Magic art: the Egyptian magicians who were successful at first (<a href='/NABRE/2/7/11'>EXO 7:11, 22</a>) and then failed (<a href='/NABRE/2/8/14'>EXO 8:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/9/11'>9:11</a>) are now powerless against the darkness and the phantoms and are totally discredited."
NABRE,70,17,14,"[3] Powerless: Hades (or Sheol), i.e., the nether world, is often portrayed in the Old Testament as a hostile power, since all must die (<a href='/NABRE/19/49/8'>PS 49:8-13</a>), but it has no power against God."
NABRE,70,17,21,[4] Darkness: of Hades or Sheol; see note on <a href='/NABRE/70/16/13'>16:13-14</a>.
NABRE,70,18,2,"[1] The difference between them: Gods distinctive manner of treating the Israelites and the Egyptians according to their respective deeds. Pleaded: perhaps, for their departure."
NABRE,70,18,4,"[2] The discussion of physical light climaxes with a reference to the ""imperishable light"" of the torah."
NABRE,70,18,5,[3] Single boy: Moses.
NABRE,70,18,9,"[4] Divine institution: the Passover. Ancestral hymns of praise: possibly the Hallel psalms, the psalms sung at the end of the Passover meal; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/26/30'>MAT 26:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/14/26'>MAK 14:26</a>."

NABRE,70,19,6,[2] The cooperation of creation in Israels deliverance (vv. <a href='/NABRE/70/19/7'>7-12</a>) under the direction of the Lord is a favorite theme; cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/16/24'>16:24-25</a>.

NABRE,71,1,1,"[1] Foreword The Law, the prophets, and the authors who followed them: an indication of the eventual tripartite division of the Hebrew Scriptures: Law (torah), Prophets (nebiim), and Writings (ketubim), shortened in the acronym Tanak. Thirty-eighth…Euergetes: 132 B.C. The reference is to Ptolemy VII, Physkon Euergetes II (170-163; 145-117 B.C.)."
NABRE,71,1,1,"[2] 1:1-10 This brief poem serves as an introduction to the book. The Lord is the source and preserver of all wisdom, which he pours out upon all. See <a href='/NABRE/18/28/20'>JOB 28:20-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/2/6'>PRO 2:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>8:22-31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/7/25'>WIS 7:25-27</a>."
NABRE,71,1,1,"[3] Wisdom: throughout the book Ben Sira describes in great detail just what wisdom is: sometimes divine (<a href='/NABRE/71/1/6'>1:6, 8</a>), sometimes a synonym for Gods law (<a href='/NABRE/71/24/22'>24:22-23</a>). Ben Sira makes clear that all wisdom comes from God."
NABRE,71,1,4,[4] Other ancient texts read as v. <a href='/NABRE/71/1/5'>5</a>: and its runlets are the ageless commandments.
NABRE,71,1,6,"[5] Other ancient texts read as v. <a href='/NABRE/71/1/7'>7</a>: her resourcefulness, who has known?"
NABRE,71,1,8,"[6] 1:8-10 In contrast to <a href='/NABRE/18/28/1'>JOB 28</a>, wisdom is not only with God, but given to all, especially Israel; see <a href='/NABRE/73/3/9'>BAR 3:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/73/4/4'>4:4</a>."
NABRE,71,1,11,"[7] 1:11-30 This is one of several poems of twenty-two bicola, or poetic lines, corresponding to the number of letters in the Hebrew alphabet. Ben Sira uses the expression ""fear of the Lord"" twelve times and the noun ""wisdom"" seven times to emphasize the connection between the two ideas. He describes the blessings that come to those who fear the Lord, i.e., those who practice true religion by loving and serving God and keeping the Law (<a href='/NABRE/71/2/7'>2:7-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/2/15'>15-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/4/11'>4:11-16</a>; see <a href='/NABRE/5/6/1'>DEU 6:1-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/5/6/24'>24</a>). Such blessings recur throughout the book."
NABRE,71,1,11,[8] Fear of the Lord: Ben Sira identifies wisdom with the fear of the Lord (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/1/26'>26-27</a>).
NABRE,71,1,12,[9] Other ancient texts read as v. <a href='/NABRE/71/1/12'>12c</a>d: also for love he makes firm paths.
NABRE,71,1,18,[10] Other ancient texts read as v. <a href='/NABRE/71/1/18'>18c</a>d: splendor opens out for those who love him.
NABRE,71,1,23,"[11] 1:23-24 Ben Sira pays close attention to kaīros, the right time, occurring some sixty times in his book."
NABRE,71,1,28,"[12] 1:28-30 Attempting to serve the Lord with duplicity of heart is hypocrisy and self-exaltation, deserving of public disgrace."
NABRE,71,2,1,"[1] 2:1-11 Serving the Lord is not without its trials (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/2/1'>1</a>); but no matter what happens, the genuine believer will remain sincere, steadfast, and faithful (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/2/2'>2-3</a>). Misfortune and humiliation are means of purification to prove ones worth (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/2/4'>4-5</a>). Ben Sira believed that patience and unwavering trust in God are ultimately rewarded with the benefits of Gods mercy and of lasting joy (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/2/6'>6-11</a>)."
NABRE,71,2,12,"[2] 2:12-18 A stern warning to those who compromise their faith in time of affliction; they fail in courage and trust and therefore have no security (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/2/12'>12-14</a>). But those who fear the Lord through obedience, reverence, love, and humility find his ""mercy equal to his majesty"" (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/2/15'>15-18</a>)."
NABRE,71,3,1,"[1] 3:1-16 Besides the virtues that must characterize our conduct toward God, special duties are enjoined, such as honor and respect toward parents, with corresponding blessings (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/1'>1-9</a>). By showing such respect especially to old and infirm parents (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/10'>10-13</a>), the sins of children are pardoned (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/14'>14-15</a>). Failure to honor father and mother is blasphemy and merits a curse from God (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/16'>16</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/12'>EXO 20:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/6/2'>EPH 6:2-3</a>."
NABRE,71,3,17,"[2] 3:17-24 Humility gives you a true estimate of yourself (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/17'>17-20</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/10/28'>10:28</a>), so that you will do what should be done, and avoid what is beyond your understanding and strength (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/21'>21-23</a>). Intellectual pride, however, leads you astray (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/24'>24</a>). Ben Sira is perhaps warning his students against the perils of Greek philosophy."
NABRE,71,3,18,[3] Other ancient texts read as v. <a href='/NABRE/71/3/19'>19</a>: but to the humble he reveals his plan.
NABRE,71,3,25,[4] 3:25-29 The antidote for stubbornness is to be found in the search for knowledge and wisdom.
NABRE,71,4,1,[1] Needy eyes: when the poor look for help; cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/18/18'>18:18</a>.
NABRE,71,4,11,"[2] 4:11-19 The Hebrew text in vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/15'>15-19</a> presents wisdom speaking in the first person, as in chap. <a href='/NABRE/71/24/1'>24</a>. The precious fruits of wisdom—life, favor, glory, blessings, Gods love—arouse desire for her (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/11'>11-14</a>). Her disciples are like ministers (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/14'>14</a>) and judges (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/15'>15</a>), whose descendants have her for their heritage (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/16'>16</a>). They enjoy happiness and learn her secrets after surviving her tests (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/17'>17-18</a>). Those who fail her are abandoned to destruction (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/19'>19</a>)."
NABRE,71,4,20,"[3] 4:20-31 The student of wisdom is warned about interior trials of discipline and external dangers to sincerity and justice, namely evil, human respect (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/20'>20-22</a>), compromise of liberty in speech and action (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/23'>23-25</a>), false shame (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/26'>26</a>). The student must fight for the truth (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/25'>25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/4/28'>28</a>), avoiding cynicism and laziness (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/29'>29</a>), and inconsistency (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/30'>30</a>)."
NABRE,71,5,1,"[1] 5:1-8 The vices of the rich are pride and independence (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/5/1'>1-2</a>), presumption (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/5/3'>3</a>), false security (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/5/4'>4-6</a>), and impenitence (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/5/7'>7</a>), which cannot escape the divine wrath (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/5/7'>7-8</a>).

NABRE,71,5,9,[3] The metaphors indicate careless behavior.
NABRE,71,6,1,[1] Thus…double-tongued!: people will say this against those disgraced by lying and double-talk.
NABRE,71,6,5,"[2] 6:5-17 One of several poems Ben Sira wrote on friendship; see also <a href='/NABRE/71/9/10'>9:10-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/12/8'>12:8-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/13/1'>13:1-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/19/13'>19:13-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/22/19'>22:19-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/27/16'>27:16-21</a>. True friends are discerned not by prosperity (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/11'>11</a>), but through the trials of adversity: distress, quarrels (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/9'>9</a>), sorrow (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/10'>10</a>) and misfortune (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/12'>12</a>). Such friends are rare, a gift from God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/14'>14-17</a>)."
NABRE,71,6,18,"[3] 6:18-37 The various figures in each of the eight stanzas urge the search for wisdom through patience (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/18'>18-19</a>), persistence (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/20'>20-22</a>), docility and perseverance (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/23'>23-28</a>). Wisdom bestows rich rewards (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/29'>29-31</a>) on those who apply themselves and learn from the wise (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/32'>32-36</a>). Although one must strive for wisdom, it is God who grants it (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/6/37'>37</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/4/11'>4:11-19</a>."
NABRE,71,6,22,"[4] Discipline: musar(in the sense of wisdom) is a perfect homonym for musar, ""removed, withdrawn""; thus the path of discipline is not accessible to many."
NABRE,71,7,1,"[1] 7:1-17 In the conduct of social relations wisdom forbids evil and injustice (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/1'>1-3</a>), pride (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/7/15'>15-17</a>), ambition and partiality (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/7/6'>6</a>), public disorder (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/7'>7</a>), presumption and impatience toward God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/9'>9-10</a>), ridicule (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/11'>11</a>), mischief and deceit toward ones neighbor (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/7/8'>8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/7/12'>12-13</a>).

NABRE,71,10,9,[1] 10:9-10 The general implication is that a slight illness today may be followed by death tomorrow. The uncertainty of life leaves no room for pride.
NABRE,71,10,19,[2] 10:19-11:6 Genuine honor comes not from ones place in society but from fear of the Lord and a true estimate of oneself. The Lord exalts the lowly and oppressed; transgressors of the commandment merit dishonor and disgrace.

NABRE,71,13,1,"[1] 13:1-14:2 By means of various images, most of them unfavorable to the rich, Ben Sira indicates the practical impossibility of genuine and sincere companionship between the poor and the rich.

NABRE,71,13,13,[2] Other ancient texts read as v. <a href='/NABRE/71/13/14'>14</a>: and call on him for your salvation.
NABRE,71,13,18,[3] The hostility between the dogs which guard the flocks (<a href='/NABRE/18/30/1'>JOB 30:1</a>) and the rapacious hyenas (<a href='/NABRE/24/12/9'>JER 12:9</a>) is proverbial in Palestine.
NABRE,71,13,24,[4] Ben Sira allows that the rich can be virtuous—but with difficulty; cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/31/1'>31:1-11</a>.
NABRE,71,14,1,"[1] 14:1-2 A clear conscience, the result of honoring personal commitments and responsibilities, brings contentment and peace."
NABRE,71,14,3,"[2] 14:3-10 Ben Sira offers a case study about the miserable life of the ""small-hearted"" (Heb. leb qaṭan) to verify vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/14/1'>1-2</a>. They are evil because they do not use their wealth properly to benefit themselves or others. While they are never satisfied that they have enough, they ignore their own needs and hospitality itself, feeding on the generosity of others, in order to protect their own resources. Ironically, after their death, strangers, with no obligation to keep their memory alive, enjoy their wealth."
NABRE,71,14,11,"[3] 14:11-19 Three realities govern Ben Siras attitude toward a proper use of wealth: the inevitability and uncertainty of death, the ephemeral nature of human accomplishments, the lack of reward or punishment after death. He advises generous enjoyment of Gods gift of wealth before death."
NABRE,71,14,20,"[4] 14:20-15:10 This poem charts the growing intimacy between those seeking Wisdom and Wisdom herself. They move from static reflection to playful pursuit, from camping outside the walls of her house to nesting inside her leafy shade. Ben Sira portrays Wisdom as both mother and bride, a feminine figure who is the fullness of womanhood according to his androcentric society."
NABRE,71,14,25,"[5] In a good place: i.e., where Wisdom dwells."
NABRE,71,14,26,[6] 14:26-27 The shift in imagery creates a more intimate relationship. Those seeking Wisdom dwell within her as a bird nests within a leafy tree.
NABRE,71,15,3,"[1] 15:3-6 In this role reversal Woman Wisdom teaches, nourishes, supports, and protects the vulnerable man. For similar imagery cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/4'>PRO 8:4-21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/20/8/34'>34-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>9:1-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/31/10'>31:10-31</a>."
NABRE,71,15,9,[2] 15:9-10 There is an intimate association between wisdom and praise of the Lord.
NABRE,71,15,11,"[3] 15:11-20 Here Ben Sira links freedom of the will with human responsibility. God, who sees everything, is neither the cause nor the occasion of sin. We have the power to choose our behavior and we are responsible for both the good and the evil we do (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/15/15'>15-17</a>)."

NABRE,71,27,4,"[1] 27:4-7, 11-15 The importance of effective speech is a favorite wisdom topic; e.g., cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/20/1'>20:1-8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/20/18'>18-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/22/27'>22:27</a>-<a href='/NABRE/71/23/15'>23:15</a>."
NABRE,71,27,16,"[2] 27:16-28:11 Betrayal of confidence through indiscretion destroys friendship and does irreparable harm (<a href='/NABRE/71/27/16'>27:16-21</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/22/22'>22:22</a>. False friendship based on hypocrisy and deceit is hateful to Ben Sira and, he adds, to God as well (<a href='/NABRE/71/27/22'>27:22-24</a>); it soon becomes a victim of its own treachery (<a href='/NABRE/71/27/25'>27:25-27</a>). The same fate awaits the malicious and vengeful (<a href='/NABRE/71/27/28'>27:28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/71/28/1'>28:1</a>). They can obtain mercy and forgiveness only by first forgiving their neighbor, being mindful of death and of the commandments of the Most High (<a href='/NABRE/71/28/2'>28:2-7</a>). And they must avoid quarrels and strife (<a href='/NABRE/71/28/8'>28:8-11</a>)."
NABRE,71,27,26,[3] This expresses a popular idea of act and consequence; an evil (or good) deed is repaid by an evil (or good) result. The frequent metaphor is the digging of a hole for another to fall into; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/26/27'>PRO 26:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/7/14'>PS 7:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/9/16'>9:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/10/8'>ECC 10:8</a>.
NABRE,71,28,12,"[1] 28:12-26 Further treatment of sins of the tongue and the havoc that results; cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/5/9'>5:9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/71/6/1'>6:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/19/5'>19:5-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/20/18'>20:18-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/23/7'>23:7-15</a>. Gossips and the double-tongued destroy domestic peace (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/28/12'>12-16</a>). The whip, the sword, chains, even Sheol, are not so cruel as the suffering inflicted by an evil tongue (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/28/17'>17-21</a>). Not the godly but those who forsake the Lord are victims of their evil tongues (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/28/22'>22-23</a>). Therefore, guard your mouth and tongue as you would guard treasure against an enemy (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/28/24'>24-26</a>)."
NABRE,71,29,1,"[1] 29:1-20 Some practical maxims concerning the use of wealth. Give to the poor (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/8'>8-9</a>), lend to a needy neighbor, but repay when a loan falls due lest the lenders burden be increased (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/1'>1-5</a>) and his kindness abused (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/6'>6-7</a>); through charity build up defense against evil (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/10'>10-13</a>). Help your neighbor according to your means, but take care not to fall (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/20'>20</a>), for the shameless play false and bring their protectors and themselves to misfortune and ruin (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/14'>14-19</a>)."
NABRE,71,29,12,"[2] 29:12-13 In Ben Siras day, almsgiving and righteousness were practically identified."
NABRE,71,29,14,[3] 29:14-17 Ben Sira is more lenient on going surety than earlier sages; cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/6/1'>PRO 6:1-5</a>.
NABRE,71,29,21,"[4] 29:21-28 Those who provide their own basic needs of food, clothing and dwelling, and are content with what they have, preserve their freedom and self-respect (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/21'>21-23</a>). But if they live as guests, even among the rich, they expose themselves to insult and rebuke (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/24'>24-28</a>)."
NABRE,71,30,1,"[1] 30:1-13 Sound discipline (which would include physical beating) and careful education of children correct self-indulgence and stubbornness, prevent remorse and humiliation, and bring to parents lasting joy and delight, prestige among friends, jealousy of enemies, perpetuation and vindication of themselves through their offspring (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/30/1'>1-6</a>). Lack of discipline and overindulgence of children bring sorrow and disappointment, terror and grief (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/30/7'>7-13</a>)."
NABRE,71,30,14,"[2] 30:14-25 Health of mind and body and joy of heart Ben Sira judges to be more precious than wealth (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/30/14'>14-16</a>), whereas bitterness, constant illness, and affliction are more difficult to bear than death (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/30/17'>17-20</a>). Sadness, resentment, anxiety, envy, and anger shorten days; they should be dispelled by cheerfulness and gladness of heart, which help to prolong ones days (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/30/21'>21-25</a>)."
NABRE,71,30,18,[3] The saying ridicules the practice of putting food and drink on the tombs of the dead.
NABRE,71,30,25,"[4] Because of the dislocation of the Greek text, the numbering of this verse follows Zieglers edition. There are no verses 25-26."
NABRE,71,31,1,[1] 31:1-11 Solicitude for acquiring wealth and anxiety over preserving it disturb repose and easily lead to sin and ruin (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/31/1'>1-7</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/6/25'>MAT 6:25-34</a>. The rich who have not sinned or been seduced by wealth are worthy of highest praise (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/31/8'>8-11</a>).
NABRE,71,31,12,"[2] 31:12-32:13 Whoever observes etiquette at table avoids greed and selfishness (<a href='/NABRE/71/31/12'>31:12-13</a>), is considerate of a neighbors likes and dislikes and is generous toward him (<a href='/NABRE/71/31/15'>31:15, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/31/23'>23</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/31/24'>24</a>), observes proper manners (<a href='/NABRE/71/31/16'>31:16-18</a>), is moderate in eating and drinking (<a href='/NABRE/71/31/19'>31:19-20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/31/25'>25-30</a>). A good host is solicitous for the guests (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/1'>32:1-2</a>), provides conversation and diversion (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/3'>32:3-6</a>), is modest in speech (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/7'>32:7, 8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/32/10'>10</a>), is respectful of elders (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/9'>32:9</a>), polite in comportment and grateful to God for his favors (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/11'>32:11-13</a>)."
NABRE,71,31,21,"[3] Get up to vomit: the practice of induced vomiting, well-known among Romans, and less well-known among the Jews, seems to be referred to here."
NABRE,71,32,14,"[1] 32:14-33:4 God is shown to reveal himself through the discipline of his law, a clear and safe plan of life for the pious. Direction and deliberation are aids in following it (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/14'>32:14-16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/32/18'>18-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/33/1'>33:1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/33/3'>3-4</a>). Sinners and hypocrites, hating the law or distorting it, fail in wisdom and are devoid of security (<a href='/NABRE/71/32/15'>32:15</a>b, 17, 18b; 33:2)."
NABRE,71,33,3,"[1] Oracle: as the answer given through the Urim and Thummim to the high priest is true, so the law proves itself true to those who obey it. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/28/30'>EXO 28:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/27/21'>NUM 27:21</a>."
NABRE,71,33,7,"[2] 33:7-15 An important doctrine of Ben Sira is his view of the polarities in creation and history; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/42/24'>42:24</a>. Contrasts observable in the physical universe as well as in the moral order serve the purposes of divine wisdom (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/5'>5-9</a>). All creatures are like clay in the hands of their Maker—the fool and the wise, the sinner and the just (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/10'>10-15</a>). This does not imply that some are created to be sinners: God is not the author of wickedness. Divine determinism and human freedom are a mysterious mix."
NABRE,71,33,16,[3] 33:16-18 Ben Sira refers to himself as the most recent of the biblical writers who have endeavored to present true wisdom to their readers.
NABRE,71,33,19,[4] 33:19-33 Public officials should reject every influence that would restrict their freedom in the management of their affairs. They must make their own household subservient to them rather than be subservient to it (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/19'>19-24</a>). Slaves are to be given food and work and correction but never to be treated unjustly (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/25'>25-30</a>). Great care should be taken of good slaves (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/31'>31-33</a>).
NABRE,71,34,1,"[1] 34:1-20 Confidence placed in dreams, divinations, and omens is false because these are devoid of reality (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/34/1'>1-8</a>). True confidence is founded on knowledge and experience (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/34/9'>9-13</a>), and above all on the fear of the Lord, with its accompanying blessings of divine assistance and protection (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/34/14'>14-20</a>)."
NABRE,71,34,21,"[2] 34:21-31 To be acts of true religion, sacrifice and penance must be accompanied by the proper moral dispositions. To offer to God goods taken from the poor (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/34/21'>21-27</a>), or to practice penance without interior reform, is a mockery, worthless in the sight of God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/34/28'>28-31</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/15/4'>MAT 15:4-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/7/9'>MAK 7:9-13</a>."

NABRE,71,36,1,"[1] 36:1-22 A prayer that God hasten the day for the gathering of the tribes of Israel, and Zion once more be filled with the divine glory. All the earth will then know that the Lord is the eternal God."

NABRE,71,36,13,"[3] This verse marks the end of a major dislocation in the Greek text of Sirach (which is followed here) at the head of chap. <a href='/NABRE/71/33/1'>33</a>. The verse numbers 1-13 come from the placement of these verses in Greek. Verse 13 here is the first half of a bicolon, the matching half of which is numbered in the Greek <a href='/NABRE/71/36/16'>36:16</a>b. Thus although the numbering for vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/36/14'>14-15</a> is not used, none of the text is missing."
NABRE,71,36,23,"[4] 36:23-37:15 In the choice of wife, friend, or associate, experience is a discerner of character (<a href='/NABRE/71/36/23'>36:23-26</a>). Beauty and soothing speech make a woman desirable as wife (<a href='/NABRE/71/36/27'>36:27-28</a>). The good wife becomes her husbands richest treasure, his help in establishing his household (<a href='/NABRE/71/36/29'>36:29-31</a>). Good friends fight for comrades and share the spoils with them (<a href='/NABRE/71/37/5'>37:5-6</a>); false friends deceive and abandon in time of need (<a href='/NABRE/71/37/1'>37:1-4</a>). A true counselor and associate should be sought among those who keep the commandments, not among those who break them and seek their own advantage (<a href='/NABRE/71/37/7'>37:7-12</a>). In all things one should pray to God for light and follow conscience (<a href='/NABRE/71/37/13'>37:13-15</a>)."
NABRE,71,37,16,"[1] 37:16-26 Thoughts determine action. Wisdom is the source of good and life; folly, of evil and death (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/37/16'>16-18</a>). If the fruits of a persons wisdom benefit himself, he may be praised in his own lifetime; if they benefit others, the praise endures after him, in their lives (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/37/19'>19-26</a>)."
NABRE,71,37,20,"[2] Verse 21 appears only in Greek, but not in the Hebrew, which is the basis for the translation here."
NABRE,71,37,27,"[3] 37:27-31 Temperance and self-control should govern appetite for food, which is intended not to destroy but to preserve life."
NABRE,71,38,1,"[1] 38:1-15 The profession of medicine comes from God, who makes the earth yield healing herbs and gives the physician knowledge of their power (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/38/1'>1-8</a>). In illness the sick should cleanse their soul from sin and petition God for help through an offering of sacrifice; the physician, too, does well to invoke God that he may understand the illness and apply the proper remedy (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/38/9'>9-14</a>). The sinner, in contrast, defies both his Maker and the doctor (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/38/15'>15</a>)."
NABRE,71,38,16,"[2] 38:16-23 A period of mourning for the deceased and care for their burial are proper (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/38/16'>16-17</a>). But grief should not be excessive, for it cannot help the dead, who will not return, and may do harm to the living. The mourner should be realistic (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/38/18'>18-23</a>)."
NABRE,71,38,24,"[3] 38:24-39:11 Ben Sira has a balanced view of the various vocations of skilled laborers—the farmer, engraver, smith and potter—but the profession of scribe is more excellent (<a href='/NABRE/71/38/24'>38:24-34</a>). He studies and meditates on the law of the Most High, seeks him in prayer of thanksgiving, petition and repentance for sin (<a href='/NABRE/71/39/1'>39:1, 5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/39/7'>7</a>), explores the wisdom of the past and present, travels abroad to observe the conduct of many peoples, and attends rulers and great men. Through the spirit of understanding granted by God, he will show forth his wisdom to the glory of Gods law, gaining renown for generations to come (<a href='/NABRE/71/39/2'>39:2-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/39/6'>6-11</a>)."
NABRE,71,39,12,"[1] 39:12-35 Ben Sira invites his disciples to join him in joyfully proclaiming his favorite theme: The works of God are all good; God supplies for every need in its own time (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/39/12'>12-16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/39/32'>32-35</a>). The sage describes Gods omniscience, supreme power and wisdom, whereby all created things, good in themselves, are ever present to him, obey him, and fulfill their intended purpose (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/39/17'>17-21</a>), bringing blessing to the virtuous, but evil and punishment to the wicked who misuse them (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/39/22'>22-31</a>).

NABRE,71,40,1,"[1] 40:1-17 The former idyllic description of the universe is contrasted with the picture of the evils afflicting humanity. Every person, high or low, is burdened from birth to death with fears, anxieties, and troubles, by day and often by night, the time appointed for rest (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/40/1'>1-7</a>). For sinners, the suffering is much greater (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/40/8'>8-10</a>).

NABRE,71,40,28,"[5] 40:28-30 Among the Jews, begging was considered degrading to human dignity; it was agreeable only to the shameless, who had lost their sense of honor. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/71/29/22'>29:22-23</a>."
NABRE,71,41,1,"[1] 41:1-13 Whether death seems bitter to one who enjoys peace, success, and pleasure, or welcome to one who is weak and in despair, it comes to all and must be accepted as the will of God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/41/1'>1-4</a>). The human body passes away (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/41/11'>11</a>). Sinners as well as their offspring pass away as if they had never been (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/41/5'>5-10</a>).

He is advised to keep a close watch on her and on her companions, lest he suffer on her account among the people (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/42/11'>11-12</a>). The exhortations, which take into account only a fathers concern, are quite unflattering to young women. The concluding statements (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/42/13'>13-14</a>) show the limitations of Ben Siras perspective in the male-oriented society of his day."

He relates the ordination of Aaron at the hands of Moses (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/15'>15</a>), and describes the priestly functions, namely, offering sacrifice to God (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/16'>16</a>), and blessing (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/15'>15</a>), teaching, governing, and judging the people (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/17'>17</a>); the inheritance of the high priest (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/20'>20-22</a>); the punishment of those who were jealous of Aaron (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/18'>18-19</a>); and the confirmation of the covenant of the priesthood with Aarons descendants through Phinehas (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/45/23'>23-25</a>)."

NABRE,71,46,1,"[1] 46:1-6 Joshua: whose name means ""the Lord is savior"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/46/1'>1</a>), was the instrument through which God delivered his people in marvelous ways (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/46/2'>2-6</a>) by destroying their enemies, whose land he gave to the Israelites as a heritage (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/46/1'>1</a>)."

NABRE,71,46,11,"[4] 46:11-20 Of the judges praised and blessed for their fidelity to God in opposing idolatry, Samuel was the greatest (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/46/11'>11-13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/46/19'>19</a>). He was judge, prophet, and priest. Through his sacrificial offering he obtained victory over the Philistines. He established the kingdom, anointed kings (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/46/13'>13-18</a>), and even after his death foretold the kings fate (v. <a href='/NABRE/71/46/20'>20</a>)."

NABRE,71,47,25,"[5] 47:25-48:11 The prophetic ministry of Elijah amid widespread idolatry is here described as a judgment by fire (<a href='/NABRE/71/48/1'>48:1</a>). Through his preaching, marvels, and acts of vengeance against Gods enemies, he succeeded for a time in restoring faith in and worship of the Lord (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/47/2'>2-8</a>). His mysterious departure from this life gave rise to the belief that he did not die but would return before the day of the Lord.

NABRE,71,48,12,"[2] 48:12-16 Elisha continued Elijahs work (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/48/12'>12-14</a>), but the obstinacy of the people eventually brought on the destruction of the kingdom of Israel and the dispersion of its subjects.

The Assyrian oppressors under Sennacherib withdrew (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/48/18'>18-19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/71/48/21'>21</a>). The kings life was prolonged. The people were consoled by Isaiahs words about the future (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/48/23'>23-25</a>); the ""consolations"" refer to <a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>ISA 40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/66/1'>66</a>."

NABRE,71,50,22,[2] 50:22-24 Ben Sira urges the reader to praise and bless God for his wondrous works and then invokes a blessing on all that they may enjoy peace and gladness of heart and the abiding goodness of the Most High.
NABRE,71,50,25,[3] Not even a people: the Samaritans.
NABRE,71,50,26,[4] Seir: Mount Seir in the territory of the Edomites. Shechem: a city in Samaria.
NABRE,71,50,27,[5] This colophon may have been the original ending of the book. It is unusual for a biblical writer to append his name.
NABRE,71,51,1,[1] 51:1-30 This chapter contains two appendixes: a prayer (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/1'>1-12</a>) and an autobiographical poem praising wisdom (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/13'>13-30</a>).

NABRE,71,51,12,"[3] After this verse the Hebrew text gives the litany of praise contained below. It is similar to <a href='/NABRE/19/136/1'>PS 136</a>. Though not found in any versions, and therefore of doubtful authenticity, the litany seems from internal evidence to go back to the time of Ben Sira. From Israel, the people near to him. Hallelujah! (Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/148/14'>PS 148:14</a>.)"
NABRE,71,51,13,"[4] 51:13-30 A Hebrew manuscript from Qumran demonstrates the acrostic style of vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/13'>13-20</a>. This is an elegant twenty-three-line alphabetic acrostic hymn that describes Ben Siras relationship to wisdom: (a) his approach to wisdom through prayer, persistent study, and instruction (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/13'>13-17</a>); (b) his purification from sin, his enlightenment, and ardent desire to possess wisdom (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/18'>18-22</a>). Ben Sira concludes with an urgent invitation to his students to receive instruction in wisdom from him, and to live by it, because wisdom gives herself to those who seek her (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/23'>23-26</a>); and for their labor, God will reward them in his own time (vv. <a href='/NABRE/71/51/27'>27-30</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/11/28'>MAT 11:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/21/12/14'>ECC 12:14</a>."
NABRE,71,51,23,[5] House of instruction: this may be a metaphor for Ben Siras teaching.
NABRE,23,1,1,"[1] The title, or inscription, of the book is an editorial addition to identify the prophet and the circumstances of his ministry. Isaiah: meaning ""the salvation of the Lord,"" or ""the Lord is salvation."" Amoz: not Amos the prophet. Judah: the Southern Kingdom of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin. Uzziah: also called Azariah; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/15/1'>2KG 15:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/26/1'>2CH 26:1</a>."

NABRE,23,1,3,"[3] Ox…ass: Isaiah uses animals proverbial for their stupidity and stubbornness to underline Israels failure to respond to God. Israel: a term Isaiah (and other prophets) frequently applies to Judah, especially after the fall of the Northern Kingdom (which Isaiah normally calls Ephraim, as in <a href='/NABRE/23/7/2'>7:2, 9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/7/17'>17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/9/8'>9:8</a>), but sometimes applies to the entire chosen people, as in <a href='/NABRE/23/8/14'>8:14</a>."
NABRE,23,1,4,"[4] Ah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/8'>5:8-24</a>. Holy One of Israel: a title used frequently in the Book of Isaiah, rarely elsewhere in the Old Testament (see <a href='/NABRE/23/5/19'>5:19, 24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/10/20'>10:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/12/6'>12:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/17/7'>17:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/29/19'>29:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/11'>30:11, 12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/30/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/31/1'>31:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/37/23'>37:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/41/14'>41:14, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/41/20'>20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/3'>43:3, 14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/11'>45:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/47/4'>47:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/48/17'>48:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/49/7'>49:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/54/5'>54:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/55/5'>55:5</a>; 60:9, 14)."
NABRE,23,1,5,"[5] 1:5-6 The Hebrew expression translated ""Why?"" may also be translated ""Where?"" The ambiguity is probably intentional: ""Why, O Israel, would you still be beaten, and where on your bruised body do you want the next blow?"" The bruised body is a metaphor for the historical disaster that has overtaken Israel (see v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/7'>7</a>) because of its sins."
NABRE,23,1,7,"[6] Sodom: Sodom and Gomorrah (see vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/9'>9-10</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/19/1'>GEN 19</a>) were proverbial as wicked cities completely overthrown and destroyed by God. Judah, more fortunate, survives at least as a remnant. The devastation of the land and the isolation of Jerusalem suggest the time of Sennacheribs invasion of 701."
NABRE,23,1,8,"[7] Daughter Zion: Jerusalem, as isolated as a little hut erected in a field for the shelter of watchmen and laborers."
NABRE,23,1,9,"[8] Lordof hosts: God, who is the Creator and Ruler of the armies of Israel, the angels, stars, etc."
NABRE,23,1,10,"[9] 1:10-17 A powerful indictment of the religious hypocrisy of rulers and others who neglect just judgment and oppress the weaker members, yet believe they can please God with sacrifices and other external forms of worship. The long list of observances suggests the Lords tedium with such attempts. Sodom…Gomorrah: the names are picked up from v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/9'>9</a>, but now to emphasize their wickedness rather than the good fortune of escaping total destruction."
NABRE,23,1,15,"[10] 1:15-16 Hands…blood: oppression of the poor is likened to violence that bloodies the hands, which explains why the hands spread out in prayer (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/15'>15</a>) are not regarded by the Lord. This climax of the accusations is followed by positive admonitions for reversing the evil situation."
NABRE,23,1,18,[11] 1:18-20 Let us set things right: the Hebrew word refers to the arbitration of legal disputes (<a href='/NABRE/18/23/7'>JOB 23:7</a>). God offers to settle his case with Israel on the basis of the change of behavior demanded above. For Israel it is a life or death choice; life in conformity with Gods will or death for continued disobedience.
NABRE,23,1,21,"[12] 1:21-28 Faithful city: the phrase, found in v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/21'>21</a> and v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/28'>28</a>, forms an inclusiowhich marks off the passage and also suggests three chronological periods: the citys former ideal state, its present wicked condition (described in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/21'>21b</a>-23), and the future ideal conditions intended by God. This will be brought about by a purging judgment directed primarily against the leaders (""judges…counselors"")."
NABRE,23,1,26,"[13] Judges: the reference must be to royal judges appointed by David and his successors, not to the tribal judges of the Book of Judges, since the ""beginning"" of Jerusalem as an Israelite city dates only to the time of David. The Davidic era is idealized here; obtaining justice in the historical Jerusalem of Davids time was more problematic (see <a href='/NABRE/10/15/1'>2SM 15:1-6</a>)."
NABRE,23,1,27,"[14] 1:27-28 These verses expand the oracle that originally ended at v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/26'>26</a>. The expansion correctly interprets the preceding text as proclaiming a purifying judgment on Zion in which the righteous are saved while the wicked perish. The meaning of ""by justice"" and ""by righteousness"" is ambiguous. Do these terms refer to Gods judgment or to the justice and righteousness of Zions surviving inhabitants? <a href='/NABRE/23/33/14'>ISA 33:14-16</a> suggests the latter interpretation."
NABRE,23,1,29,"[15] 1:29-31 These verses were secondarily inserted here on the catchword principle; like v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/28'>28</a> they pronounce judgment on certain parties ""together"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/31'>31</a>). The terebinths and gardens refer to the sacred groves or asherahs that functioned as idolatrous cultic symbols at the popular shrines or high places (<a href='/NABRE/11/14/23'>1KG 14:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/17/10'>2KG 17:10</a>). Hezekiah cut down these groves during his reform (<a href='/NABRE/12/18/4'>2KG 18:4</a>); they were a religious issue during Isaiahs ministry (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/17/7'>ISA 17:7-11</a>). Isaiah threatens those who cultivate these symbols with the same fate that befalls trees when deprived of water."
NABRE,23,2,1,"[1] This editorial heading probably introduced the collection of chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/1'>2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/12/1'>12</a>, to which chap. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/1'>1</a> with its introduction was added later (see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/1/2'>1:2-31</a>)."
NABRE,23,2,2,"[2] 2:2-22 These verses contain two very important oracles, one on the pilgrimage of nations to Mount Zion (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/2'>2-4</a>—completed with an invitation to the ""house of Jacob,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/5'>5</a>), the other on the day of the Lord (see note on <a href='/NABRE/30/5/18'>AMO 5:18</a>), which was probably composed from at least two earlier pieces. Whereas vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/6'>6-8</a> indict Judah for trust in superstitious practices and human resources rather than in the Lord, the following verses are directed against humankind in general and emphasize the effect of the ""day of the Lord,"" the humbling of human pride. This may be taken as a precondition for the glorious vision of vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/2'>2-4</a>. This vision of Zions glorious future, which is also found in a slightly variant form in <a href='/NABRE/33/4/1'>MIC 4:1-4</a>, is rooted in the early Zion tradition, cultivated in the royal cult in Jerusalem. It celebrated Gods choice of Jerusalem as the divine dwelling place, along with Gods choice of the Davidic dynasty (<a href='/NABRE/19/68/16'>PS 68:16-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/78/67'>78:67-72</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/132/13'>132:13-18</a>). Highest mountain: the Zion tradition followed earlier mythological conceptions that associate the abode of deities with very high mountains (<a href='/NABRE/19/48/2'>PS 48:2-3</a>). The lifting of Mount Zion is a metaphor for universal recognition of the Lords authority."
NABRE,23,2,4,"[3] Once the nations acknowledge God as sovereign, they go up to Jerusalem to settle their disputes, rather than having recourse to war."
NABRE,23,2,5,"[4] This verse is added as a conclusion to vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/2/2'>2-4</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/33/4/4'>MIC 4:4-5</a>, where a quite different conclusion is provided for the parallel version of this oracle."
NABRE,23,2,9,"[5] Bowing down to idols will not bring deliverance to Israel, but rather total abasement. Do not pardon them: this line is so abrupt that it is almost certainly an intrusion in the text."
NABRE,23,2,11,"[6] That day: i.e., the day of the Lord; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/30/5/18'>AMO 5:18</a>."
NABRE,23,2,13,"[7] Lebanon: Mount Lebanon in Syria, famed for its cedars. Bashan: the fertile uplands east of the Sea of Galilee."
NABRE,23,2,22,"[8] The meaning of this verse, certainly a later addition, is not clear. It is not addressed to God but to a plural subject."
NABRE,23,3,1,"[1] 3:1-12 These verses suggest deportation, with resulting social upheaval, and thus may date to sometime after Ahaz submitted as vassal to Assyria. The deportation practiced by Assyria, as later by Babylon, exiled the leading elements of society, such as those named in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/3/2'>2-3</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/24/12'>2KG 24:12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/24/14'>14-16</a> for a similar list of those exiled by the Babylonians. Denuding society of its leaders opens the way to near anarchy and a situation in which leadership is seized by or thrust upon those unqualified for it (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/3/5'>5-7</a>). The situation has been provoked by sinfully inept leadership (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/3/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/3/8'>8-9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/3/12'>12</a>). Some suggest that vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/3/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/3/12'>12</a> refer to Ahaz, who may have come to the throne at an early age. Verses 10-11 form a wisdom couplet that was inserted later."
NABRE,23,3,13,"[2] 3:13-15 The princes and the elders, here accused of despoiling the poor, are the very ones who should be their defenders. Loot: by the Hebrew term (gazela) Isaiah conveys the idea of violent seizure, though <a href='/NABRE/23/10/1'>10:1-4</a> suggests the poor could be plundered by legal means."
NABRE,23,3,16,[3] 3:16-4:1 Here and again in <a href='/NABRE/23/32/9'>32:9-14</a> Isaiah condemns the women of the ruling class for their part in Jerusalems plight.
NABRE,23,3,17,[4] A shaven head is a mark of social disgrace; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/5/18'>NUM 5:18</a>.
NABRE,23,3,18,"[5] 3:18-23 The long list of womens apparel in these verses suggests luxury and vanity; it contains a number of rare words, and the precise meaning of many of the terms is uncertain."
NABRE,23,3,25,[6] Your men…your champions: the second person feminine singular pronoun here shows that the prophet has shifted his attention from the women of Zion to the personified city of Zion.
NABRE,23,4,1,"[1] Seven women…one man: deportation (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/23/3/1'>3:1-12</a>) would result in a disproportion of the sexes and leave the female population without enough male partners. The women are willing to marry, not for support, but to avoid disgrace."
NABRE,23,4,2,[2] 4:2-6 Usually judged a later addition to the oracles of Isaiah. It relieves the threatening tone of the surrounding chaps. 3 and 5.
NABRE,23,4,2,"[3] Branch: the term (Heb. semah) that is sometimes used of the ideal Davidic king of the future (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/5'>JER 23:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/33/15'>33:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/3/8'>ZEC 3:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/6/12'>6:12</a>). However, the parallel ""fruit of the land"" does not favor that usage here."
NABRE,23,4,3,[4] Inscribed for life: in Gods list of the elect; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/32/32'>EXO 32:32</a>.
NABRE,23,5,1,"[1] 5:1-7 Vineyard: although the term is sometimes used in an erotic context (<a href='/NABRE/22/1/6'>SON 1:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/22/8/12'>8:12</a>), ""vineyard"" or ""vine"" is used more frequently as a metaphor for Gods people (<a href='/NABRE/23/27/2'>27:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/80/9'>PS 80:9, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/80/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/2/21'>JER 2:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/12/10'>12:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/17/7'>EZE 17:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/10/1'>HOS 10:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/34/2/2'>NAH 2:2</a>). The terms translated ""friend"" (yadid) and ""beloved"" (dod) suggest the Lords favor (<a href='/NABRE/5/33/12'>DEU 33:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/10/12/25'>2SM 12:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/127/2'>PS 127:2</a>) and familial background rather than introducing the piece as a ""love song,"" as is sometimes suggested. The prophet disguises the real theme (the peoples infidelity) so that the hearers will participate in the unfavorable judgment called for (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/3'>3-4</a>). Cf. the reversal of this parable in <a href='/NABRE/23/27/2'>27:2-6</a>."
NABRE,23,5,5,[2] 5:5-6 Trampled…thorns and briers: this judgment is echoed in the description of the devastated land in <a href='/NABRE/23/7/23'>7:23-25</a>.
NABRE,23,5,7,"[3] Judgment…bloodshed…justice…outcry: in Hebrew there is an impressive play on words: mishpatparallels mispah, sedaqahparallels seaqah. See also the threefold ""waited for"" in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/5/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/5/7'>7</a>."
NABRE,23,5,8,"[4] 5:8-24 These verses contain a series of short oracles introduced by the Hebrew particle hoy(""Ah!""), an emphatic exclamation, sometimes translated ""Woe!"""
NABRE,23,5,8,[5] 5:8-10 An oracle against land-grabbers (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/8'>8</a>); they will be impoverished instead of enriched (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/9'>9-10</a>).
NABRE,23,5,10,"[6] Ten acres: a field with ten times the surface area a yoke of oxen could plow in one day. Bath: a liquid measure equal to about twelve gallons. Homer: a dry measure equal to what a donkey can carry, calculated to be about ten bushels. Ephah: a dry measure of about one bushel. So small a harvest is the fruit of the land-grabbers greed."
NABRE,23,5,11,"[7] 5:11-13 An oracle against debauchery and indifference. Strong drink: the Hebrew word shekarmeans either beer or a type of wine, perhaps date wine, not distilled liquor."
NABRE,23,5,19,"[8] An indication that some, presumably of the ruling class, scoff at Isaiahs teaching on the Lords ""plan"" and ""work"" (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/12'>12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/14/26'>14:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/28/9'>28:9-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/10'>30:10-11</a>)."
NABRE,23,5,25,"[9] 5:25-30 These verses do not suit their present context. Apparently v. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/25'>25</a> was originally the conclusion of the poem of <a href='/NABRE/23/9/7'>9:7-20</a> directed against the Northern Kingdom; cf. the refrain that occurs here and in <a href='/NABRE/23/9/11'>9:11, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/9/20'>20</a>. Verses 26-30 look to an invasion by Assyria and might originally have come immediately after the poem of <a href='/NABRE/23/9/1'>9:1-20</a> plus <a href='/NABRE/23/5/25'>5:25</a>. The insertion of chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/6/1'>6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/8/1'>8</a> may have occasioned the dislocation, as well as that of <a href='/NABRE/23/10/1'>10:1-4</a>a, which may have originally belonged with the ""reproach"" oracles of <a href='/NABRE/23/5/8'>5:8-23</a>."
NABRE,23,5,26,"[10] 5:26-30 This oracle threatens a future judgment, an invasion of the Assyrian army, Gods instrument for punishing Judah (<a href='/NABRE/23/10/5'>10:5, 15</a>)."
NABRE,23,6,1,"[1] In the year King Uzziah died: probably 742 B.C., although the chronology of this period is disputed. A high and lofty throne: within the holy of holies of the Jerusalem Temple stood two cherubim, or winged sphinxes, whose outstretched wings served as the divine throne (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/23'>1KG 6:23-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/1/4'>EZE 1:4-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/10/1'>10:1, 20</a>). The ark of the covenant was Gods footstool (<a href='/NABRE/19/132/7'>PS 132:7-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/28/2'>1CH 28:2</a>), placed under the cherubim (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/6'>1KG 8:6-7</a>). Temple: the holy place, just in front of the holy of holies."
NABRE,23,6,2,"[2] Seraphim: the plural of saraph(""to burn""), a term used to designate the ""fiery"" serpents of the wilderness (<a href='/NABRE/4/21/8'>NUM 21:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/8/15'>DEU 8:15</a>), and to refer to ""winged"" serpents (<a href='/NABRE/23/14/29'>ISA 14:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/6'>30:6</a>). Here, however, it is used adjectivally of the cherubim, who are not serpent-like, as seen in the fact that they have faces and sexual parts (""feet""). See the adaptation of these figures by Ezekiel (<a href='/NABRE/26/1/10'>EZE 1:10-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/10/4'>10:4-15</a>)."
NABRE,23,6,3,"[3] Holy, holy, holy: these words have been used in Christian liturgy from the earliest times."
NABRE,23,6,4,[4] Smoke: reminiscent of the clouds which indicated Gods presence at Mount Sinai (<a href='/NABRE/2/19/16'>EXO 19:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/11'>DEU 4:11</a>) and which filled the tabernacle (<a href='/NABRE/2/40/34'>EXO 40:34-38</a>) and the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/10'>1KG 8:10-11</a>) at their dedication.
NABRE,23,6,5,"[5] Doomed: there are two roots from which the verb here could be derived; one means ""to perish, be doomed,"" the other ""to become silent,"" and given Isaiahs delight in puns and double entendre, he probably intended to sound both notes. ""I am doomed!"" is suggested by the popular belief that to see God would lead to ones death; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/32/31'>GEN 32:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/33/20'>EXO 33:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/13/22'>JUG 13:22</a>. ""I am struck silent!"" is suggested by the emphasis on the lips in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/6/5'>5-6</a>, and such silence is attested elsewhere as the appropriate response to the vision of the Lord in the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/35/2/20'>HAB 2:20</a>)."
NABRE,23,6,7,[6] Touched your lips: Isaiah is thus symbolically purified of sin in preparation for his mission as Gods prophet.
NABRE,23,6,9,"[7] 6:9-10 Isaiahs words give evidence that he attempted in every way, through admonition, threat, and promise, to bring the people to conversion (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/18'>1:18-20</a>), so it is unlikely that this charge to ""harden"" is to be understood as Isaiahs task; more probably it reflects the refusal of the people, more particularly the leaders, who were supposed to ""see,"" ""hear,"" and ""understand,"" a refusal which would then lead to a disastrous outcome (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/6/11'>11-12</a>)."
NABRE,23,6,11,[8] 6:11-12 The desolation described would be the result of the sort of deportation practiced by the Assyrians and later by the Babylonians. Isaiah seems to expect this as an eventual consequence of Judahs submission as vassal to the Assyrians; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/3/1'>3:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/5/13'>5:13</a>.
NABRE,23,6,13,"[9] When its leaves have fallen: the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain, and the text may be corrupt. Holy offspring: part of the phrase is missing from the Septuagint and may be a later addition; it provides a basis for hope for the future."
NABRE,23,7,1,"[1] 7:1-8:18 These verses (often termed Isaiahs ""Memoirs"") contain a series of oracles and narratives (some in first person), all closely related to the Syro-Ephraimite war of 735-732 B.C. Several passages feature three children whose symbolic names refer to the Lords purposes: Shear-jashub (<a href='/NABRE/23/7/3'>7:3</a>), Emmanuel (<a href='/NABRE/23/7/10'>7:10-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/8/8'>8:8-10</a>), and Maher-shalal-hash-baz (<a href='/NABRE/23/8/1'>8:1-4</a>). Judah and its Davidic dynasty should trust Gods promises and not fear the combined armies of Israel and Syria; within a very short time these two enemy states will be destroyed, and Davids dynasty will continue."
NABRE,23,7,1,[2] Days of Ahaz: who ruled from 735 to 715 B.C. This attack against Jerusalem by the kings of Aram (Syria) and Israel in 735 B.C. was occasioned by the refusal of Ahaz to enter with them into an anti-Assyrian alliance; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/16/1'>2KG 16</a>.
NABRE,23,7,3,"[3] Shear-jashub: this name means ""a remnant will return"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/10/20'>10:20-22</a>)."
NABRE,23,7,5,"[4] Planned: the plans of those who plot against Ahaz shall not be accomplished (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/7/7'>7</a>). What the Lord plans will unfailingly come to pass, whereas human plans contrary to those of the Lord are doomed to frustration; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/8/10'>8:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/14/24'>14:24-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/19/11'>19:11-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/29/15'>29:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/1'>30:1</a>. See further the note on <a href='/NABRE/23/14/24'>14:24-27</a>."
NABRE,23,7,6,[5] Son of Tabeel: a puppet of Jerusalems enemies. His appointment would interrupt the lawful succession from David.
NABRE,23,7,8,"[6] 7:8-9 God had chosen and made a commitment to Davids dynasty and his capital city Jerusalem, not to Rezin and his capital Damascus, nor to the son of Remaliah and his capital Samaria (<a href='/NABRE/10/7/12'>2SM 7:12-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/2/6'>PS 2:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/78/68'>78:68-72</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/132/11'>132:11-18</a>). Within sixty-five years…nation: this text occurs at the end of v. <a href='/NABRE/23/7/8'>8</a> in the Hebrew. Ahaz would not have been reassured by so distant a promise; the phrase is probably a later addition."
NABRE,23,7,11,[7] Deep…sky: an extraordinary or miraculous sign that would prove Gods firm will to save the royal house of David from its oppressors.
NABRE,23,7,12,[8] Tempt the Lord: Ahaz prefers to depend upon the might of Assyria rather than the might of God.
NABRE,23,7,14,"[9] Isaiahs sign seeks to reassure Ahaz that he need not fear the invading armies of Syria and Israel in the light of Gods promise to David (<a href='/NABRE/10/7/12'>2SM 7:12-16</a>). The oracle follows a traditional announcement formula by which the birth and sometimes naming of a child is promised to particular individuals (<a href='/NABRE/1/16/11'>GEN 16:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/13/3'>JUG 13:3</a>). The young woman: Hebrew almahdesignates a young woman of marriageable age without specific reference to virginity. The Septuagint translated the Hebrew term as parthenos, which normally does mean virgin, and this translation underlies <a href='/NABRE/40/1/23'>MAT 1:23</a>. Emmanuel: the name means ""with us is God."" Since for the Christian the incarnation is the ultimate expression of Gods willingness to ""be with us,"" it is understandable that this text was interpreted to refer to the birth of Christ."
NABRE,23,7,15,[10] 7:15-16 Curds and honey: the only diet available to those who are left after the devastation of the land; cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/7/21'>21-25</a>.
NABRE,23,7,17,[11] Such days as have not come since Ephraim seceded: the days of the kingdom prior to the secession of Ephraim and the other northern tribes (<a href='/NABRE/11/12/1'>1KG 12</a>). The king of Assyria: the final comment appears to be a later editorial gloss indicating days worse than any since the secession.
NABRE,23,7,20,"[12] God will use the Assyrians from across the River (the Euphrates) as his instrument (""razor"") to inflict disgrace and suffering upon his people. Ahaz paid tribute to the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III, who decimated Syria and Israel in his campaigns of 734-732 B.C. (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/16/7'>2KG 16:7-9</a>). The feet: euphemism for sexual parts; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/6/2'>ISA 6:2</a>."
NABRE,23,7,23,[13] 7:23-25 Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/5'>5:5-6</a>.
NABRE,23,8,1,"[1] Ordinary stylus: lit., ""stylus of men."" Maher-shalal-hash-baz: a symbolic name to be given to another son of Isaiah (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/8/3'>3</a>); it means ""quick spoils; speedy plunder,"" and describes what the Assyrians will do to Syria and Israel."
NABRE,23,8,2,[2] Reliable witnesses: who would testify that Isaiah had indeed prophesied the future destruction. Uriah the priest: cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/16/10'>2KG 16:10</a>.
NABRE,23,8,6,"[3] 8:6-8 This people: Judah. Waters of Shiloah: the stream that flows from the Gihon spring into the pool of Shiloah in Jerusalem and provides a sure supply in time of siege; here it symbolizes the divine protection which Judah has rejected by seeking Assyrian support, symbolized by ""the River"" (i.e., the Euphrates). Ultimately Assyrian power will devastate Judah. His outspread wings: the Lords wings, a recurring symbol for divine protection (<a href='/NABRE/19/17/8'>PS 17:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/36/8'>36:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/57/2'>57:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/61/5'>61:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/91/4'>91:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/8/2/12'>RUT 2:12</a>). Some understand the image to refer to the sides of the flooding river, but this use of the Hebrew word for ""wings"" is unparalleled elsewhere in classical Hebrew."
NABRE,23,8,10,"[4] The plan of Israels enemies will be thwarted because, as the name ""Emmanuel"" signifies, ""with us is God."""
NABRE,23,8,12,"[5] 8:12-14 Because Isaiah and his followers resisted the official policy of seeking help from Assyria they were labeled ""conspirators""; Isaiah uses the term to express what is really the case, cooperating with the Lord."
NABRE,23,8,16,"[6] Bind…seal…with my disciples: because the prophets message was not well received at the time, he wanted to preserve it until the future had vindicated him as Gods true prophet (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/8'>30:8-9</a>)."
NABRE,23,8,18,"[7] Signs: in the meantime, while awaiting the vindication of his message, Isaiah and his children with their symbolic names stood as a reminder of Gods message to Israel."
NABRE,23,8,19,[8] Chirp and mutter: a mocking reference to necromancers.
NABRE,23,8,20,[9] Surely…no dawn: reliance on necromancy brings futility.
NABRE,23,8,22,[10] Oppressive gloom…without light: the meaning of the Hebrew here is quite uncertain.
NABRE,23,8,22,"[11] 8:23-9:6 The meaning of <a href='/NABRE/23/8/23'>8:23</a> is somewhat uncertain, for example, whether the expressions translated ""once"" and ""now"" refer to times or to individuals, and also whether the verbs speak of degrading and glorifying the territories. If this traditional translation is correct, the passage would seem to promise the former Northern Kingdom of Israel deliverance from the Assyrians and might relate to Hezekiahs program of trying to reincorporate the northern territories into the kingdom of Judah and thus restore the boundaries of the country as it was under David."
NABRE,23,8,23,[12] The territories mentioned in this verse are those which the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser III took from Israel and incorporated into the Assyrian provincial system as a result of the Syro-Ephraimite War of 735-732 B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/12/15/29'>2KG 15:29</a>). Zebulun…Naphtali: regions of the former Northern Kingdom of Israel. The way of the Sea: the area along the Mediterranean coast south of Mount Carmel which became the Assyrian province of Dor. Land across the Jordan: the province of Gilead east of the Jordan. Galilee of the Nations: the territory north of Mount Carmel which was incorporated in the Assyrian province of Megiddo. Galilee apparently had a large non-Israelite population. <a href='/NABRE/40/4/15'>MAT 4:15-16</a> cites this verse in the context of the beginning of Jesus public mission in Galilee.
NABRE,23,9,3,[1] Day of Midian: when God used the judge Gideon to deliver these northern territories from Midianite oppression (<a href='/NABRE/7/6/1'>JUG 6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/7/7/1'>7</a>).
NABRE,23,9,5,"[2] A child: perhaps to be identified with the Emmanuel of <a href='/NABRE/23/7/14'>7:14</a> and <a href='/NABRE/23/8/8'>8:8</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/1'>11:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/11/9'>9</a>. This verse may reflect a coronation rather than a birth. Upon his shoulder: the reference may be to a particular act in the ritual in which a symbol of the kings authority was placed on his shoulder (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/11/12'>2KG 11:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/22/22'>ISA 22:22</a>)."
NABRE,23,9,7,"[3] 9:7-20 + 5:25-30 These verses describe a series of judgments God sent against the Northern Kingdom of Israel because of its sins. Despite the judgments, however, Israel continued to rebel, and Gods anger remained unabated, as the recurring refrain emphasizes (<a href='/NABRE/23/9/11'>9:11, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/9/20'>20</a>). The refrain ties <a href='/NABRE/23/9/7'>ISA 9:7-20</a> together as a unit, but <a href='/NABRE/23/9/20'>9:20</a> is far too abrupt to be the original conclusion to the oracle. With its series of past judgments and repeated refrain, the oracle resembles <a href='/NABRE/30/4/6'>AMO 4:6-12</a>; by analogy with that model one expects a conclusion in which the prophet turns from the narration of past judgments to the announcement of a future judgment. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/25'>ISA 5:25-30</a> fits the pattern found in <a href='/NABRE/23/9/7'>9:7-20</a> and provides a suitable and possibly original conclusion for the whole oracle."
NABRE,23,9,11,"[4] Aram: the Syrian kingdom, with its capital at Damascus."
NABRE,23,9,20,"[5] Manasseh…Ephraim: two of the leading tribes of the Northern Kingdom. The reference is to the civil wars that marked the final decades of the Northern Kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/12/15/10'>2KG 15:10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/15/14'>14-16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/15/25'>25</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/7/3'>HOS 7:3-7</a>)."
NABRE,23,10,1,[1] 10:1-4 This is another hoy-oracle; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/8'>5:8-24</a>. It may originally have been part of the collection at <a href='/NABRE/23/5/8'>5:8-24</a>.
NABRE,23,10,4,"[2] For all this…outstretched!: this refrain appears to be out of place here; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/9/11'>9:11, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/9/20'>20</a>."
NABRE,23,10,5,"[3] 10:5-34 These verses contain a series of oracles directed against Assyria. Verses 5-15 portray Assyria as simply the rod God uses to punish Israel, though Assyria does not realize this. The original conclusion to this unit may be the judgment found in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/10/24'>24-27</a>a, which continues the imagery and motifs found in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/10/5'>5-15</a>. Verses 16-23, because of the quite different imagery and motifs, may originally have been an insertion directed against Aram and Israel at the time of the Syro-Ephraimite War."
NABRE,23,10,6,"[4] Impious nation: Judah. It was Gods intention to use Assyria merely to punish, not to destroy, the nation."
NABRE,23,10,9,"[5] 10:9-10 The cities mentioned were all cities captured, some more than once, by the Assyrians in the eighth century B.C. Verse 9 suggests a certain historical order in the fall of these cities, and v. <a href='/NABRE/23/10/10'>10</a> suggests that all of them had fallen before Samaria (cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/6/2'>AMO 6:2</a>). That implies that one should think primarily of events during the reign of Tiglath-pileser III (745-727)."
NABRE,23,10,16,[6] His fat ones: the strong men of the enemy army.
NABRE,23,10,21,"[7] A remnant will return: in Hebrew, shear-jashub, an allusion to the name of Isaiahs son, Shear-jashub; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/7/3'>7:3</a>."
NABRE,23,10,24,[8] This verse with its reference to Assyrias rod may introduce the original conclusion to vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/10/5'>5-15</a>.
NABRE,23,10,27,"[9] 10:27b-32 A poetic description of the march of an enemy army from the north, advancing south to the very gates of Jerusalem, where the enemy waves his hand in a gesture of derision against the city. Though Sennacheribs troops took a different route, advancing down the coast and then approaching Jerusalem from the southeast, the arrogant attitude toward Gods chosen city was the same. Aiath: the Ai of <a href='/NABRE/6/7/22'>JOS 7:22</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/8/29'>8:29</a>. Migron: modern Makrun north of Michmash. The ravine: the deep valley between Michmash and Geba (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/14/1'>1SM 14:1-5</a>). Ramah…Gibeah…Bath-Gallim…Laishah…Anathoth…Madmenah…Gebim: cities north of Jerusalem threatened by the sudden appearance of this enemy army. Nob: probably to be identified with the present Mount Scopus from where one has a clear view of Jerusalem."
NABRE,23,10,33,"[10] 10:33-34 Just when the enemy is about to capture Jerusalem, God intervenes and destroys the hostile army. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/29/1'>29:1-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/31/4'>31:4-9</a>."
NABRE,23,11,1,[1] 11:1-9 (10) Here Isaiah looks forward to a new Davidide who will realize the ancient ideals (see <a href='/NABRE/19/72/1'>PS 72</a>). The oracle does not seem to have a particular historical person in mind.
NABRE,23,11,1,"[2] Shoot…stump: the imagery suggests the bankruptcy of the monarchy as embodied in the historical kings, along with the need for a new beginning, to spring from the very origin from which David and his dynasty arose. Jesse: Davids father (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/16/1'>1SM 16:1-13</a>)."
NABRE,23,11,2,"[3] 11:2-3 The source of the traditional names of the gifts of the Holy Spirit. The Septuagint and the Vulgate read ""piety"" for ""fear of the Lord"" in its first occurrence, thus listing seven gifts."
NABRE,23,11,6,[4] 11:6-9 This picture of the idyllic harmony of paradise is a dramatic symbol of universal peace and justice under the rule of the new Davidic king. The peace and harmony even among carnivores and their natural prey in this description suggest a paradisiac aspect of the reign of the new king.
NABRE,23,11,10,"[5] 11:10-16 This passage, with its reference to Gods people in widely scattered lands, is probably from a much later period. God will restore them to their own land. The reconciliation of Ephraim (i.e., the Northern Kingdom) and Judah reverses what Isaiah saw as a disastrous event of the past (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/7/17'>7:17</a>). Gods action is likened to a new exodus, analogous to the time God first acquired Israel in bringing them out of the land of Egypt. Pathros: upper Egypt. Elam: east of Babylonia. Shinar: Babylonia. Hamath: on the Orontes River in Syria. Isles: or coastlands, in the Mediterranean."
NABRE,23,11,14,"[6] People of the east: tribes in the Arabian Desert (cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/6/3'>JUG 6:3, 33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/7/12'>7:12</a>)."
NABRE,23,11,15,[7] Tongue: perhaps to be identified with the Gulf of Suez.
NABRE,23,12,1,"[1] 12:1-6 Israels thanksgiving to the Lord, expressed in language like that of the Psalms."
NABRE,23,12,6,"[2] 13:1-23:18 These chapters, which probably existed at one time as an independent collection, consist primarily of oracles from various sources against foreign nations. While some of the material is Isaianic, in many cases it has been reworked by later editors or writers."
NABRE,23,13,1,"[1] 13:1-22 Although attributed to Isaiah (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/1'>1</a>), this oracle does not reflect conditions of Isaiahs time. Babylon did not achieve imperial status until a century later, after its victory over Assyria in 609 B.C. The mention of the Medes (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/17'>17</a>) rather than Persia suggests a date prior to 550 B.C., when the Median empire of Astyages fell to Cyrus the Persian. Tension is created in that the attackers are not named until v. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/17'>17</a> and the foe to be attacked until v. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/19'>19</a>."
NABRE,23,13,1,[2] Oracle: Heb. massa; used eight more times in this collection.
NABRE,23,13,2,"[3] To them: the Medes (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/17'>17</a>), who are being summoned to destroy Babylon. Gates of the nobles: the reference is apparently to the gates of Babylon and involves a wordplay on the city name (Babylon = bab ilani, ""gate of the gods"")."
NABRE,23,13,3,"[4] Consecrated ones: in the sense that they will wage a ""holy war"" and carry out Gods plan."
NABRE,23,13,6,"[5] 13:6-8 Day of the Lord: described often in prophetic writings, it generally signified the coming of the Lord in power and majesty to destroy his enemies. The figures used convey the idea of horror and destruction (<a href='/NABRE/30/5/18'>AMO 5:18-20</a>). The Almighty: Heb. shaddai; there is a play on words between destruction (shod) and Shaddai, a title for God traditionally rendered as ""the Almighty"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>GEN 17:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/6/3'>EXO 6:3</a>)."

NABRE,23,13,21,"[7] Satyrs: in the popular mind, demons of goatlike form dwelling in ruins, symbols of immorality; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/7'>LEV 17:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/34/14'>ISA 34:14</a>."
NABRE,23,14,2,[1] Possess them: Israel will make slaves of the nations who escort it back to its land.
NABRE,23,14,4,"[2] 14:4-21 This taunt-song, a satirical funeral lament, is a beautiful example of classical Hebrew poetry. According to the prose introduction and the prosaic conclusion (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/14/22'>22-23</a>), it is directed against the king of Babylon, though Babylon is mentioned nowhere in the song itself. If the reference to Babylon is accurate, the piece was composed long after the time of Isaiah, for Babylon was not a threat to Judah in the eighth century. Some have argued that Isaiah wrote it at the death of an Assyrian king and the references to Babylon were made by a later editor, but this is far from certain."
NABRE,23,14,12,"[3] Morning Star: term addressed to the king of Babylon. The Vulgate translates as ""Lucifer,"" a name applied by the church Fathers to Satan. Son of the dawn: Heb., ben shahar, may reflect the name of a pagan deity."
NABRE,23,14,13,"[4] 14:13-15 God: not Elohim, the common word for God, but El, the name of the head of the pantheon in Canaanite mythology, a god who was early identified with the Lord in Israelite thought. Mount of Assembly: mountain where the council of the gods met, according to Canaanite mythology. Zaphon: the sacred mountain of Baal, originally the Jebel el-Aqra north of Ugarit, but other mountains have been identified with it, including Mount Zion in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/19/48/3'>PS 48:3</a>). The attempt to usurp the place of God (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/14/14'>14</a>), coupled with the dramatic reversal (""above the stars of God"" to ""the depths of the pit"") occasioned the interpretation that saw here the rebellion and fall of Satan."
NABRE,23,14,21,"[5] Cities: if the text is correct, it presumably refers to cities as expressions of human pride, authority, and oppression (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/11/1'>GEN 11:1-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/34/3/1'>NAH 3:1-4</a>)."
NABRE,23,14,24,"[6] 14:24-27 The motif of Gods plan or work is a recurring thread running through Isaiahs oracles.

NABRE,23,14,27,"[8] 14:28-31 This oracle seems to reflect the political situation soon after the death of Ahaz in 715 B.C., when Ashdod and the other Philistine cities were trying to create a united front to rebel against Assyria. Ahaz had refused to join the rebels in 735 B.C. and remained loyal to Assyria during the rest of his reign, but the Philistines may have had higher hopes for his son Hezekiah. Judah, however, did not join in Ashdods disastrous revolt in 713-711 B.C. (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/20/1'>20:1</a>)."
NABRE,23,14,28,[9] The year that King Ahaz died: 715 B.C.
NABRE,23,14,29,"[10] The occasion for this oracle is usually taken to be the death of an Assyrian king; the Philistines were vassals of Assyria, whereas no victories of Ahaz over the Philistines are recorded. The chronological notice (in the year that King Ahaz died) may be incorrect, for no Assyrian king died around 715, the date usually assigned for the death of Ahaz. Flying saraph: a winged cobra, often portrayed in Egyptian art and on Israelite seals. The Hebrew saraphmeans ""to burn"" and perhaps is applied to the cobra because of the burning sensation of its bite."

NABRE,23,15,1,"[1] 15:1-16:14 Both the historical situation reflected in this oracle against Moab and the date of composition are uncertain. Variants of the same poem are found in <a href='/NABRE/24/48/1'>JER 48</a>, and there are connections with <a href='/NABRE/4/21/27'>NUM 21:27-30</a> as well."

This would be a gracious act on Judahs part, since its relations with Moab were strained at best."

Since it was near a large population center, the fields there would be thoroughly gleaned by the poor after the harvest, leaving very few ears of grain."

NABRE,23,17,13,"[8] 17:13-14 The passage seems to evoke the motif of invincibility, part of the early Zion tradition that Jerusalem could not be conquered because God protected it (<a href='/NABRE/19/48/1'>PS 48:1-8</a>)."
NABRE,23,18,1,"[1] 18:1-2 Land of buzzing insects: the region of the Upper Nile where these multiplied with great rapidity. Ethiopia: in Hebrew, Kush. The center of this ancient kingdom corresponds geographically to the modern Sudan, Roman Nubia. Papyrus boats: light and serviceable vessels made of bundles of papyrus stalks and sealed with pitch. Egypt, ruled by a dynasty from Ethiopia, had invited Judah to join a coalition against Assyria, but Isaiah told the ambassadors to return to their own people."
NABRE,23,18,3,"[2] 18:3-6 A more general address but probably relating to the same topic. The Lord will not act at once, but later there will be a ""harvest"" of terrible destruction, probably directed against Assyria (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/14/24'>14:24-27</a>)."
NABRE,23,19,4,[1] Cruel master…harsh king: possibly the Nubian (Ethiopian) Shabaka who gained control of all of Egypt around 712 B.C.

NABRE,23,20,1,"[1] Ashdod: a city of Philistia. In 713 B.C., Azuri, the king of Ashdod was deposed by Sargon for plotting rebellion, but the citizens of Ashdod rejected the ruler installed by the Assyrian king and followed a certain Yamani, who in 712 B.C., with the protection of Egypt, attempted to draw Edom, Moab, and Judah into a coalition against Assyria. In 711 B.C., Sargons general marched against Ashdod, and Yamani fled to Ethiopia. Ashdod was captured, and a short time later Ethiopia handed Yamani over to the Assyrians for punishment."
NABRE,23,20,2,"[2] 20:2-6 Isaiahs nakedness is a symbolic act to convey the message that Assyria would lead the Egyptians and Ethiopians away as captives. The Judeans and their allies would then realize the folly of having trusted in them. The purpose of the oracle was to dissuade Hezekiah, the Judean king, from being drawn into Ashdods anti-Assyrian coalition (<a href='/NABRE/23/14/28'>14:28-32</a>)."
NABRE,23,21,1,[1] 21:1-10 This oracle against Babylon is probably to be dated to the period just before the fall of Babylon to the Persians in 539 B.C. (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/21/9'>9</a>).
NABRE,23,21,1,[2] Wastelands by the sea: Babylonia. Negeb: the wilderness south of Judah.

Seir: a site in Edom. The Edomites ask the prophet how much longer they must suffer (""the night"" of suffering); he answers ambiguously: ""Liberation (""morning"") and further suffering (""night""),"" but perhaps they will later receive a more encouraging answer (""ask; come back again"")."
NABRE,23,21,13,[6] 21:13-14 In the steppe: the north Arabian steppe where the oases referred to were located. Dedanites: a north Arabian tribe associated with the oasis of Tema; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/7'>GEN 10:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/25/3'>25:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/25/23'>JER 25:23</a>.
NABRE,23,21,16,[7] Year…of a hired laborer: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/16/13'>16:13-14</a>. Kedar: a nomadic tribe in Arabia; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/42/11'>42:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/7'>60:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/120/5'>PS 120:5</a>.
NABRE,23,22,1,"[1] 22:1-14 The title ""oracle on the valley of vision,"" like the other oracle headings in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/1'>13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/23/1'>23</a>, was supplied by an editor and is taken from v. <a href='/NABRE/23/22/5'>5</a>. In all probability it relates to the events of 701, the lifting of Sennacheribs siege of Jerusalem. The death of the Assyrian king Sargon II in 705 occasioned the revolt of many of the vassal nations subject to Assyria, a revolt in which Hezekiah joined, over Isaiahs bitter opposition. The biblical and other data concerning the outcome of this adventure are conflicting and confusing. While <a href='/NABRE/12/19/1'>2KG 19</a> (<a href='/NABRE/23/37/1'>ISA 37</a>) tells of a miraculous deliverance of the city after the siege had been renewed, Assyrian documents and <a href='/NABRE/12/18/13'>2KG 18:13-16</a> report that Sennacherib, Sargon IIs successor, devastated Judah (the destruction of forty-six cities is mentioned in Assyrian records); Hezekiah had to surrender and paid Sennacherib a heavy indemnity, taken from the Temple treasury and adornments. The inhabitants of Jerusalem apparently took the lifting of the siege as occasion for great rejoicing, a response that Isaiah condemns. They should be mourning the dead and learning that their confidence in allies rather than in the Lord leads to disaster."
NABRE,23,22,2,[2] 22:2-3 The retreat of Judahs soldiers is a further reason that rejoicing is not in order.
NABRE,23,22,5,"[3] Valley of Vision: frequently identified as the Hinnom Valley, west of Jerusalem."
NABRE,23,22,6,[4] Elam…Kir: the Assyrian forces presumably included auxiliary troops from various places.
NABRE,23,22,8,"[5] Shelter over Judah is removed: the reference is obscure; it has been suggested that Judahs protection was Jerusalem itself, and with the fall of the city the country was exposed. House of the Forest: an armory built by Solomon; its columns of wood suggested the trees of a forest; cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/7/2'>1KG 7:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/10/17'>10:17</a>."
NABRE,23,22,9,"[6] 22:9-11 Frenetic efforts made to fortify the city before the impending siege; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/20/20'>2KG 20:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/32/3'>2CH 32:3-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/14/32/30'>30</a>. Some suggest that the description of these preparations comes from the time of Nebuchadnezzars assault on Jerusalem in 588. You did not look to the citys Maker: Isaiah here makes the crucial point. Jerusalems safety lay not in military forces nor in alliances with other nations nor in playing power politics but in the Lord, here presented as the creator and founder of the city. Isaiah may be alluding to the belief that the city was inviolable."
NABRE,23,22,15,"[7] Shebna: by the time of the siege of Jerusalem in <a href='/NABRE/23/36/3'>36:3</a>, Shebna, the scribe, no longer held the office of master of the palace."
NABRE,23,22,16,[8] What is probably Shebnas inscribed tomb has been discovered in the village of Silwan on the eastern slope of Jerusalem.
NABRE,23,22,20,"[9] Eliakim: by the time of the events described in <a href='/NABRE/23/36/3'>36:3</a>, Eliakim had replaced Shebna as master of the palace."

NABRE,23,22,24,"[11] 22:24-25 Apparently Eliakim proved to be a disappointment, so an oracle of judgment was added to the originally positive oracle to Eliakim."
NABRE,23,23,1,"[1] 23:1-17 This oracle, a satire directed against the Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon, is perhaps to be situated at the time of Sennacheribs campaign against the Phoenican cities in 701 B.C, following his subjugation of their Babylonian allies in 703 B.C."
NABRE,23,23,1,"[2] Kittim: Cyprus. The Hebrew word is derived from the term for the well-known city of Cyprus, Kition. In later centuries the term Kittim is used for the Greeks, the Romans, and other distant peoples."
NABRE,23,23,3,[3] Shihor: a synonym for the Nile.
NABRE,23,23,4,"[4] The sea: here personified, it brings to distant coasts the news that Sidon must disown her children; her people are dispersed."
NABRE,23,23,6,"[5] 23:6-7 Tarshish: perhaps Tartessus in Spain. Distant lands: the reference is to the far-flung colonies established by the Phoenicians throughout the Mediterranean, including North Africa, Spain, and Sardinia. Oceangoing vessels were therefore called Tarshish ships."
NABRE,23,23,11,[6] Canaans strongholds: the fortresses of Phoenicia.
NABRE,23,23,13,"[7] The reference here seems to be to Assyrias subjugation of Babylon in 703 B.C., which left the coastal cities of Phoenicia as well as Judah open to Sennacheribs invasion in 701 B.C. Founded it…its palaces…turn it: the city of Babylon."
NABRE,23,23,15,[8] Seventy years: a conventional expression for a long period of time; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/25/11'>JER 25:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/29/10'>29:10</a>.

NABRE,23,23,18,"[10] 24:1-27:13 Although it has become traditional to call these chapters ""Apocalypse of Isaiah,"" and although they do contain some apocalyptic traits, many others are lacking, so that the title is imprecise as a designation. These chapters are not a unified composition and their growth into their present form was a long, complicated process. They echo many themes from chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/1'>13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/23/1'>23</a>, ""Oracles Against the Foreign Nations,"" as well as from earlier parts of Isaiah (e.g., the reversal of the ""vineyard song,"" 5:1-7, in <a href='/NABRE/23/27/2'>27:2-5</a>). Of particular interest is an unnamed city (<a href='/NABRE/23/24/10'>24:10-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/25/2'>25:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/26/5'>26:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/27/10'>27:10-11</a>), a wicked city, doomed to destruction; to the extent that it is identifiable, it may be Babylon, but more generally it symbolizes all forces hostile to God. And it stands in contrast to another city, also unnamed but no doubt to be identified with Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/23/26/1'>26:1-2</a>)."

NABRE,23,25,6,"[2] This mountain: i.e., Jerusalems mountain, Zion."
NABRE,23,25,10,[3] 25:10-12 Moab: one of Israels bitterest enemies.
NABRE,23,26,1,"[1] 26:1-19 This text is a mixture of praise for the salvation that will take place, a confession of Judahs inability to achieve deliverance on its own, and earnest prayer that God may quickly bring about the longed-for salvation."
NABRE,23,26,1,"[2] Strong city: Jerusalem, the antithesis of the ""city of chaos"" (<a href='/NABRE/23/24/10'>24:10</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/24/1'>24:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/27/13'>27:13</a>."
NABRE,23,26,19,"[3] This verse refers not to resurrection of the dead, but to the restoration of the people; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/37/1'>EZE 37</a>. The population of Judah was radically reduced by the slaughter and deportations that the historical disasters of the late eighth and seventh centuries B.C. brought upon the country. In this context, a major concern for the future was for an increase in the population, a rebirth of the nations life."
NABRE,23,26,20,"[4] 26:20-21 The time of wrath for Judah would soon be over, and the just punishment of its enemies would begin (cf. <a href='/NABRE/35/2/1'>HAB 2:1-3</a>)."
NABRE,23,27,1,[1] Leviathan…dragon: the description of Leviathan is almost identical to a passage from a much earlier Ugaritic text. The sea dragon became a symbol of the forces of evil which God vanquishes even as he overcame primeval chaos; cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/23/30/7'>30:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>51:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/3/8'>JOB 3:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/7/12'>7:12</a>; no power can challenge God. Leviathan is even spoken of playfully in <a href='/NABRE/19/104/26'>PS 104:26</a>.
NABRE,23,27,2,"[2] 27:2-5 This passage mitigates the harsh words on Israel as the Lords vineyard in <a href='/NABRE/23/5/1'>5:1-7</a>; here is given the rain there withheld, though Israels welfare is still made dependent on fidelity."
NABRE,23,27,7,"[3] 27:7-9 Israel was not treated as sternly as were its enemies whom God used to punish it. God did, however, drive Israel from its land, and if it wants to make peace with God, it must change its former cultic practices, destroying its altars and sacred groves (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/17/7'>17:7-11</a>)."
NABRE,23,27,12,[4] Gleaned: God will harvest his people who have been scattered from Assyria to Egypt. Note the same language of gleaning to describe the remnant of the Northern Kingdom in <a href='/NABRE/23/17/5'>17:5-6</a>.
NABRE,23,27,13,[5] The remnant of Israel will return to Jerusalem for worship; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/10'>11:10-16</a>.
NABRE,23,28,1,"[1] 28:1-6 These verses once constituted an independent oracle against the Northern Kingdom, probably originally spoken during the time between its overthrow by Assyria in 732 and its destruction in 722/721. Isaiah has reused them as an introduction to his oracle against Judah (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/28/7'>7-22</a>), because the leaders of Judah were guilty of the same excesses that had once marked Ephraims leadership."
NABRE,23,28,1,"[2] Ephraim: the Northern Kingdom. Its capital, Samaria, was built upon a hill, suggestive of a majestic garland adorning a human head. The characterization of the leadership of Ephraim as drunken underscores its inattention to justice and good government (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/11'>5:11-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/6/1'>AMO 6:1-6</a>)."
NABRE,23,28,2,"[3] A strong one, a mighty one: Assyria (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/8/7'>8:7-8</a>)."
NABRE,23,28,9,"[4] 28:9-10 The words of those who ridicule Isaiah. The Hebrew of v. <a href='/NABRE/23/28/10'>10</a>, by its very sound, conveys the idea of mocking imitation of what the prophet says, as though he spoke like a stammering child: ""sau lasau, sau lasau, kau lakau, kau lakau, zeer sham, zeer sham."" But in v. <a href='/NABRE/23/28/13'>13</a> God repeats these words in deadly earnest, putting them in the mouth of the victorious Assyrian army."
NABRE,23,28,11,[5] God will answer the mockers and defend Isaiah. Strange language: spoken by the invading army.
NABRE,23,28,14,"[6] Who rule: there is a play on words; the same expression could also mean, ""Proverb makers,"" that is, scoffers of this people."
NABRE,23,28,15,"[7] 28:15, 18 A covenant with death, with Sheol: an alliance with foreign powers, such as Egypt and Babylon. Have made lies…a hiding place: this confidence in human aid will prove to be false and deceitful, incapable of averting the dreaded disaster. Raging flood: the Assyrian invasion; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/8/7'>8:7-8</a>."
NABRE,23,28,16,"[8] A stone in Zion: the true and sure foundation of salvation, i.e., the presence of God, who had chosen and founded Zion as his city (<a href='/NABRE/19/78/68'>PS 78:68-69</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/14/32'>ISA 14:32</a>) and had chosen the Davidic dynasty to rule over his people (<a href='/NABRE/19/78/70'>PS 78:70-72</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/9/1'>ISA 9:1-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/11/1'>11:1-10</a>). Cornerstone: the assurance of salvation, rejected by the people of Judah in the prophets time, is picked up in <a href='/NABRE/19/118/22'>PS 118:22</a> and later applied to Christ; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/21/42'>MAT 21:42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/20/17'>LUK 20:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/4/11'>ACT 4:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/9/33'>ROM 9:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/2/7'>1PE 2:7</a>. Chapters 28-31 alternate between threats of the danger of rebelling against Assyria (with implied trust in Egypt) with assurances of the power and protection of the Lord."
NABRE,23,28,17,"[9] Line…level: instruments used in constructing a building, to keep it true. They are used metaphorically here to refer to the qualities that Zion, the city of God, must manifest, judgment and justice, not bloodshed (<a href='/NABRE/33/3/10'>MIC 3:10</a>), nor deceit and violence, which would result in a bulging unstable wall doomed to destruction (<a href='/NABRE/23/30/12'>ISA 30:12-14</a>). Cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/3/10'>1CO 3:10-17</a>."
NABRE,23,28,21,"[10] Mount Perazim…Valley of Gibeon: where David defeated the Philistines; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/5/20'>2SM 5:20, 25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/14/11'>1CH 14:11, 16</a>. Gods new work will be strange, because instead of fighting for Judah as the Lord did in Davids time, God will now fight against Jerusalem (see <a href='/NABRE/23/29/1'>29:1-4</a>)."
NABRE,23,28,23,"[11] 28:23-29 The practical variation of the farmers work reflects the way God deals with his people, wisely adapted to circumstances; he does not altogether crush them in their weakness."
NABRE,23,28,25,[12] Caraway…cumin: herbs used in seasoning food. Spelt: a variety of wheat.
NABRE,23,29,1,"[1] 29:1-2 Ariel: a poetic name for Jerusalem. It has been variously interpreted to mean ""lion of God,"" ""altar hearth of God"" (<a href='/NABRE/26/43/15'>EZE 43:15-16</a>), ""city of God,"" or ""foundation of God."" In v. <a href='/NABRE/23/29/2'>2</a> the term refers to ""altar hearth,"" i.e., a place of burning for its people (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/33'>30:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/31/9'>31:9</a>). God will attack Jerusalem, as David did long ago."
NABRE,23,29,7,"[2] 29:7-8 Just when the attackers think their capture of Jerusalem is certain, the Lord will snatch victory from their hands and save the city. The sudden shift from the Lords attack on the city to its deliverance by him is surprising and unexplained; it may reflect the account related in <a href='/NABRE/23/37/36'>37:36</a>."
NABRE,23,29,9,"[3] 29:9-16 Despite their show of piety, Judahs leaders refused to accept the prophets words of assurance. They rejected prophetic advice (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/10'>30:10-11</a>), did not consult the prophetic oracle in forming their political plans (<a href='/NABRE/23/30/1'>30:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/31/1'>31:1</a>), and tried to hide their plans even from Gods prophet (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/29/15'>15</a>), who, they thought, simply did not understand military and political reality."
NABRE,23,29,10,[4] Prophets…seers: interpretive glosses.
NABRE,23,29,17,"[5] 29:17-24 The prophet presents the positive aspects of Gods plan in terms of a series of reversals: an end to pride, ignorance, and injustice. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/32/3'>32:3-5</a>."
NABRE,23,29,22,[6] Who redeemed Abraham: perhaps by revealing himself and delivering Abraham from idolatrous worship; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/12/1'>GEN 12:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>17:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/6/24/2'>JOS 24:2-3</a>.
NABRE,23,30,1,"[1] 30:1-17 Several independent oracles against making an alliance with Egypt have been strung together in this chapter: vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/1'>1-5</a>, vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/6'>6-7</a>, and vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/8'>8-17</a>. That these were originally separate oracles is indicated by the fact that the oracle in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/6'>6-7</a> is still introduced by its own heading: Oracle on the Beasts of the Negeb."
NABRE,23,30,1,"[2] Make an alliance: lit., ""pour out a libation,"" namely, as part of the ritual of treaty making."
NABRE,23,30,2,"[3] Without asking my counsel: it was a practice to consult God through the prophets or through the priestly oracle before making a major political decision (<a href='/NABRE/9/23/1'>1SM 23:1-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/5'>1KG 22:5</a>), but Judahs leadership, in its concern for security, was apparently trying to keep its plan for a treaty with Egypt secret even from the prophets, thus implicitly from God (<a href='/NABRE/23/29/15'>29:15</a>)."
NABRE,23,30,6,"[4] Distressed…land: the wilderness between Judah and Egypt, through which Judahite messengers had to pass, carrying their tribute to Egypt to buy assistance in the struggle against Assyria. Flying saraph: see notes on <a href='/NABRE/23/6/2'>6:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/14/29'>14:29</a>."
NABRE,23,30,7,"[5] Here as elsewhere (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/87/4'>PS 87:4</a>) Egypt is compared to Rahab, the raging, destructive sea monster (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>ISA 51:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/26/12'>JOB 26:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/11'>PS 89:11</a>); yet Egypt, when asked for aid by Judah, becomes silent and ""sits still."""
NABRE,23,30,8,[6] Isaiah will write down his condemnation of the foolish policy pursued so that the truth of his warning of its dire consequences (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/12'>12-17</a>) may afterward be recognized.
NABRE,23,30,10,"[7] Seers…prophets: the two terms are synonyms for prophetic figures such as Isaiah (<a href='/NABRE/23/1/1'>1:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/2/1'>2:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/6/1'>6:1, 5</a>). There is wordplay between the nouns and their cognate verbs, both of which mean ""to see."" The authorities are depicted as forbidding prophets to contradict their secret political and military policies."
NABRE,23,30,20,"[8] Teacher: God, who in the past made the people blind and deaf through the prophetic message (<a href='/NABRE/23/6/9'>6:9-10</a>) and who in his anger hid his face from the house of Jacob (<a href='/NABRE/23/8/17'>8:17</a>), shall in the future help them to understand his teaching clearly (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/31/34'>JER 31:34</a>)."
NABRE,23,30,27,"[9] 30:27-33 Gods punishment of Assyria. The name of the Lord: here, God himself; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/20/2'>PS 20:2</a>."
NABRE,23,30,33,"[10] Tophet: a site, near Jerusalem, where children were sacrificed by fire to Molech (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/10'>2KG 23:10</a>), and where, probably, Ahaz sacrificed his son (<a href='/NABRE/12/16/3'>2KG 16:3</a>). Here, Isaiah speaks of ""his tophet,"" the site prepared for burning up the king of Assyria. King: there seems to be a play on words between the Heb. word for king (melek) and the name Molech. This defeat of Assyria becomes the occasion for Israels festal rejoicing (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/30/32'>32</a>)."
NABRE,23,31,1,"[1] Seek the Lord: a technical expression for seeking a prophetic or priestly oracle, similar to the expression ""asking my counsel"" in <a href='/NABRE/23/30/2'>30:2</a>. The prophet complains that Judah has decided on its policy of alliance with Egypt without first consulting the Lord."
NABRE,23,31,9,"[2] Crag: the king as the rallying point of the princes. Panic: terror is an element of Israels holy war tradition, in which defeat of the enemy is accomplished by the Lord rather than by human means (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/23/31/8'>8</a>)."
NABRE,23,32,14,"[1] The castle: the fortified royal palace in Jerusalem. Citadel: Ophel, the fortified hill, with its stronghold called ""the great projecting tower"" (<a href='/NABRE/16/3/27'>NEH 3:27</a>)."
NABRE,23,32,15,"[2] 32:15-18, 20 Extraordinary peace and prosperity will come to Israel under just rulers."
NABRE,23,32,19,"[3] Probably from a different context, perhaps after v. <a href='/NABRE/23/32/14'>14a</a>."
NABRE,23,33,1,"[1] 33:1-24 After an introductory address to Assyria (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/1'>1</a>), there follows a prayer on behalf of Jerusalem which recalls what God had done in the past (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/2'>2-6</a>) and a description of the present situation (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/7'>7-9</a>). In response, the Lord announces a judgment on Assyria (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/10'>10-12</a>) that will lead to the purification of Jerusalems inhabitants (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/13'>13-16</a>). The text ends with an idealized portrait of the redeemed Jerusalem of the future (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/17'>17-24</a>)."
NABRE,23,33,7,"[2] Ariel…Shalem: Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/29/1'>29:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/14/18'>GEN 14:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/76/3'>PS 76:3</a>. There is a play on words between ""Shalem,"" the city name, and shalom, Heb. for ""peace."""
NABRE,23,33,9,[3] Sharon: the fertile plain near the Mediterranean.
NABRE,23,33,17,[4] King: either the ideal Davidic king or God; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/23/33/22'>22</a>.
NABRE,23,33,21,"[5] 33:21-23 Galley…majestic ship: of a foreign oppressor. Though the broad streams of the future Jerusalem will make it accessible by boat, no foreign invader will succeed in a naval attack on the city, for the Lord will protect it, the enemy fleet will be disabled, and even the weakest inhabitants will gather much plunder from the defeated enemy."
NABRE,23,33,24,"[6] 34:1-35:10 These two chapters form a small collection which looks forward to the vindication of Zion, first by defeat of its enemies (chap. <a href='/NABRE/23/34/1'>34</a>), then by its restoration (chap. <a href='/NABRE/23/35/1'>35</a>). They are generally judged to be later than the time of Isaiah (eighth century), perhaps during the Babylonian exile or thereafter; they are strongly influenced by Deutero-Isaiah (sixth century). In places they reflect themes from other parts of the Isaian collection."
NABRE,23,34,8,"[1] 34:8-17 The extreme hostility against Edom in this passage is reflected in a number of other prophetic texts from the seventh and sixth centuries B.C. (cf. e.g., 63:1-6; <a href='/NABRE/24/49/7'>JER 49:7-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/25/12'>EZE 25:12-14</a>). The animus was probably prompted by Edomite infiltration of the southern territories of Judah, especially after the Babylonian conquest of Judah."

NABRE,23,34,17,[5] Casts the lot…measures off: an ironic reference to how land might be distributed to new possessors (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/14/1'>JOS 14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/21/1'>21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/2/5'>MIC 2:5</a>).
NABRE,23,35,1,"[1] 35:1-10 This chapter contains a number of themes similar to those in Deutero-Isaiah (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/55/1'>55</a>), for example, the blossoming of the wilderness (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/35/1'>1-2</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/41/18'>41:18-19</a>), which is now well-irrigated (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/35/7'>7</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/43/19'>43:19-20</a>); sight to the blind (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/35/5'>5-6</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/42/7'>42:7, 16</a>); a highway in the wilderness (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/35/8'>8</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/41/3'>41:3</a>); and the return of the redeemed/ransomed to Zion (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/35/9'>9-10</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/51/11'>51:11</a>). Nevertheless, it forms a unit with chap. <a href='/NABRE/23/34/1'>34</a> (see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/34/1'>34:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/35/10'>35:10</a>) and reflects, along with that chapter, themes found in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/33/1'>33</a>."
NABRE,23,35,10,"[2] 36:1-39:8 Except for <a href='/NABRE/23/38/9'>38:9-20</a> (Hezekiahs prayer of thanksgiving), this historical appendix describing the siege, etc., is paralleled in <a href='/NABRE/12/18/13'>2KG 18:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/20/19'>20:19</a>, which, however, has certain details proper to itself. The events are also reflected in the cuneiform inscriptions of Sennacherib."
NABRE,23,36,1,"[1] The occasion for this Assyrian attack was Hezekiahs attempt to reject Judahs status as vassal to Assyria, relying on help from Egypt, a course of action condemned by Isaiah (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/23/28/15'>28:15, 18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/28/16'>28:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/29/7'>29:7-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/1'>30:1-17</a>; etc.). <a href='/NABRE/12/19/14'>2KG 19:14-16</a> reports that Hezekiah surrendered to the Assyrians and paid the tribute imposed on him—a report omitted in the Isaiah text."
NABRE,23,36,7,[2] The Assyrians assert that Hezekiahs removal of the high places and altars (unofficial sanctuaries) was taken by the Lord as an insult. They declare to Jerusalems emissaries that the city therefore no longer has a right to the Lords protection and that they are the ones who truly carry out his will (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/23/36/10'>10</a>).
NABRE,23,36,11,"[3] The emissaries of King Hezekiah ask that the conversation be carried on in Aramaic, not in Hebrew, for they fear the effect of the Assyrian claims upon the morale of the people."
NABRE,23,37,1,"[1] 37:1-35 There appear to be parallel accounts of Hezekiahs appeal and the response received (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/37/1'>1-7</a> and vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/37/14'>14-35</a>): in each, Hezekiah goes to the Temple, refers to the Assyrian boasts (found in <a href='/NABRE/23/36/15'>36:15-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/37/10'>37:10-14</a>), and receives a favorable response from Isaiah."
NABRE,23,37,3,[2] A proverbial expression. In the Bible the pangs of childbirth often typify extreme anguish; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/8'>13:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/6/24'>JER 6:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/4/9'>MIC 4:9-10</a>. In this instance there is reference to the desperate situation of Hezekiah from which he would scarcely be able to free himself.
NABRE,23,37,9,"[3] Tirhakah: may have been general of the Egyptian army in 701 B.C.; later he became pharaoh, one of the Ethiopian dynasty of Egyptian kings (ca. 690-664 B.C.). Many consider that this account in Isaiah combines features of two originally distinct sieges of Jerusalem by Sennacherib."
NABRE,23,37,16,"[4] In contrast to the empty boasting of the Assyrians, Hezekiah proclaims the Lord as ""God over all the kingdoms of the earth."""
NABRE,23,37,21,[5] 37:21-37 The reversal of Isaiahs attitude toward Hezekiahs revolt (see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/36/1'>36:1</a>) and a wonderful deliverance after Hezekiah had already submitted and paid tribute raise questions difficult to answer. See note on <a href='/NABRE/23/22/1'>22:1-14</a>. Some have postulated that chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/36/1'>36</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/37/1'>37</a> combine accounts of two different Assyrian invasions.
NABRE,23,37,30,[6] A sign: sets a time limit. After two years the normal conditions of life will be resumed. See the similar use of time limits as signs in <a href='/NABRE/23/7/15'>7:15-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/8/4'>8:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/16/14'>16:14</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/23/21/16'>21:16</a>. You: Hezekiah.
NABRE,23,37,36,"[7] The destruction of Sennacheribs army is also recorded by Herodotus, a Greek historian of the fifth century B.C. It was possibly owing to a plague, which the author interprets as Gods activity."
NABRE,23,37,38,[8] The violent death of Sennacherib (681 B.C.) is also mentioned in non-biblical sources. It occurred twenty years after his invasion of Judah. Ararat: the land of Urartu in the mountains north of Assyria.
NABRE,23,38,1,"[1] 38:1-39:8 The events of this section—sickness and recovery of Hezekiah, embassy of Merodach-baladan—anticipate the rise of Babylon (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/66/1'>66</a>). They occurred prior to the events of <a href='/NABRE/23/36/1'>36:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/37/38'>37:38</a>, which point back to Assyria (<a href='/NABRE/23/1/1'>1:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/35/10'>35:10</a>)."
NABRE,23,38,1,[2] In those days: before the siege of Jerusalem in 701 B.C.
NABRE,23,38,5,"[3] Since Hezekiah died in 687 B.C., his sickness may have occurred in 702 B.C., that is, fifteen years before."
NABRE,23,38,8,"[4] Stairway to the terrace of Ahaz: this interpretation is based on a reading of the Hebrew text revised according to the Dead Sea Scroll of Isaiah; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/23/12'>2KG 23:12</a>. Many translate the phrase as ""steps of Ahaz"" and understand this as referring to a sundial."
NABRE,23,38,10,[5] In the noontime of life: long before the end of a full span of life; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/55/24'>PS 55:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/102/25'>102:25</a>.
NABRE,23,38,11,[6] See the Lord: go to the Temple and take part in its service.
NABRE,23,38,12,[7] These two metaphors emphasize the suddenness and finality of death.
NABRE,23,38,15,[8] 38:15-16 The Hebrew text is very problematic and its meaning uncertain.
NABRE,23,38,17,"[9] Behind your back you cast all my sins: figurative language to express the divine forgiveness of sins, as if God no longer saw or cared about them."
NABRE,23,38,18,[10] 38:18-19 See note on <a href='/NABRE/19/6/6'>PS 6:6</a>.
NABRE,23,38,21,"[11] 38:21-22 These verses are clearly out of place. Logically they should come after v. <a href='/NABRE/23/38/6'>6</a>, as they do in the parallel account in <a href='/NABRE/12/20/1'>2KG 20</a>, but the two accounts are not identical, and it appears that the version in Isaiah is abbreviated from that in Kings. If that is so, <a href='/NABRE/23/38/21'>ISA 38:21-22</a> would be a secondary addition from Kings, inserted by a later reader who thought the account incomplete."
NABRE,23,39,1,"[1] Merodach-baladan: twice king of Babylon, probably from 721 to 710 B.C., and again for nine months, in 704-703. This visit of his messengers, certainly before 701, was in reality a political one. Babylon hoped to lead an anti-Assyrian confederation composed of neighboring states and wanted Judah to join."
NABRE,23,39,6,"[2] Because Judah preferred to follow a pro-Babylonian policy, instead of trusting in the Lord, it would later be exiled to Babylon."
NABRE,23,39,8,[3] Hezekiah was relieved that the disaster would not occur in his lifetime.
NABRE,23,40,1,"[1] 40:1-55:13 Chapters 40-55 are usually designated Second Isaiah (or Deutero-Isaiah) and are believed to have been written by an anonymous prophet toward the end of the Babylonian exile. Isaiah, who is named frequently in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/39/1'>39</a>, does not appear here; the Assyrians, the great threat during the eighth century, hardly appear; the Judeans are in Babylon, having been taken there by the victorious Babylonians; Cyrus, the Persian king, is named; he will defeat Babylon and release the captives. Second Isaiah, who sees this not as a happy circumstance but as part of Gods age-old plan, exhorts the Judeans to resist the temptations of Babylonian religion and stirs up hopes of an imminent return to Judah, where the Lord will again be acknowledged as King (<a href='/NABRE/23/52/7'>52:7</a>). Because the prophet proclaimed the triumph of Persia over Babylon, his message would have been considered seditious, and it is very likely for this reason that the collection would have circulated anonymously. At some point it was appended to <a href='/NABRE/23/1/1'>ISA 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/39/1'>39</a> and consequently was long considered the work of Isaiah of Jerusalem of the eighth century. But the fact that it is addressed to Judean exiles in Babylon indicates a sixth-century date. Nevertheless, this eloquent prophet in many ways works within the tradition of Isaiah and develops themes found in the earlier chapters, such as the holiness of the Lord (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/23/1/4'>1:4</a>) and his lordship of history. Second Isaiah also develops other Old Testament themes, such as the Lord as Israels redeemer or deliverer (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/8'>EXO 3:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/6/6'>6:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/15/13'>15:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/18/8'>18:8</a>)."
NABRE,23,40,1,"[2] The ""voices"" of vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/3'>3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/40/6'>6</a> are members of the heavenly court addressing the prophet; then v. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>1</a> can be understood as the Lord addressing them. It is also possible to translate, with the Vulgate, ""Comfort, give comfort, O my people"" (i.e., the exiles are called to comfort Jerusalem). The juxtaposition of ""my people"" and ""your God"" recalls the covenant formulary."
NABRE,23,40,2,[3] Service: servitude (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/7/1'>JOB 7:1</a>) and exile.
NABRE,23,40,3,"[4] 40:3-5 A description of the return of the exiles from Babylon to Jerusalem (Zion). The language used here figuratively describes the way the exiles will take. The Lord leads them, so their way lies straight across the wilderness rather than along the well-watered routes usually followed from Mesopotamia to Israel. <a href='/NABRE/40/3/3'>MAT 3:3</a> and gospel parallels adapt these verses to the witness of John the Baptizer to Jesus."
NABRE,23,40,9,"[5] Herald of good news: i.e., of the imminent restoration of the people to their land. This theme of the proclamation of the good news occurs elsewhere in Second Isaiah; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/23/41/27'>41:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/52/7'>52:7</a>."
NABRE,23,40,12,"[6] The implicit answer is ""the hand of the Lord"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/2'>2</a>). Waters…heavens…earth: together form the universe; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>GEN 1:1-2</a>. Span: the distance between the extended little finger and the thumb. Fingers: lit., ""three fingers"" (i.e., thumb, index, and middle)."
NABRE,23,40,15,"[7] Drop…wisp of cloud…a speck: the smallest constituent parts of the cosmic waters, heavens, and earth mentioned in v. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/12'>12</a>."
NABRE,23,40,16,[8] Lebanon…fuel: the famed cedars would not be enough to keep the fires of sacrifice burning.

NABRE,23,40,27,"[11] 40:27-28 The exiles, here called Jacob-Israel (<a href='/NABRE/1/32/29'>GEN 32:29</a>), must not give way to discouragement: their Lord is the eternal God."
NABRE,23,41,1,"[1] 41:1-4 Earlier prophets had spoken of the Assyrians and Babylonians as the Lords instruments for the punishment of Israels sins; here the Lord is described as raising up and giving victory to a foreign ruler in order to deliver Israel from the Babylonian exile. The ruler is Cyrus (<a href='/NABRE/23/44/28'>44:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/1'>45:1</a>), king of Anshan in Persia, a vassal of the Babylonians. He rebelled against the Babylonian overlords in 556 B.C., and after a series of victories, entered Babylon as victor in 539; the following year he issued a decree which allowed the Jewish captives to return to their homeland (<a href='/NABRE/14/36/22'>2CH 36:22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/15/1/1'>EZR 1:1-4</a>). For Second Isaiah, the meteoric success of Cyrus was the work of the Lord to accomplish the deliverance promised by earlier prophets."
NABRE,23,41,4,[2] The first…the last: God as the beginning and end encompasses all reality. The same designation is used in <a href='/NABRE/23/44/6'>44:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/48/12'>48:12</a>.
NABRE,23,41,14,"[3] Redeemer: in Hebrew, goel, one who frees others from slavery and avenges their sufferings; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/48'>LEV 25:48</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/19/6'>DEU 19:6, 12</a>. Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/8/2/20'>RUT 2:20</a>."
NABRE,23,41,21,"[4] 41:21-29 This indictment of Babylonian gods is patterned on a legal trial, in which they are challenged to prove power over events of history and so justify their status as gods (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/41/21'>21-24</a>). Israels God, on the other hand, has foretold and now brings to pass Israels deliverance (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/41/25'>25-27</a>). The accused are unable to respond (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/41/28'>28-29</a>). By such polemics (see also <a href='/NABRE/23/43/12'>43:12</a>) the prophet declares that all gods other than the Lord are nonexistent; this implicit claim of monotheism later becomes explicit (see <a href='/NABRE/23/43/10'>43:10-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/5'>45:5-7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/45/14'>14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/45/18'>18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/45/21'>21-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/46/9'>46:9</a>; and note on <a href='/NABRE/23/44/6'>44:6</a>)."
NABRE,23,41,22,"[5] Things of long ago…things to come: there are no predictions attributed to idols that have since been fulfilled. Second Isaiah makes frequent reference to ""things of long ago,"" sometimes in conjunction with ""things to come"" or ""new things"" in connection with the Lords activity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/42/9'>42:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/9'>43:9, 18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/46/9'>46:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/48/3'>48:3-8</a>); both the old things (e.g., creation, exodus) and the new things (release from exile) God brings to pass (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>51:9-11</a>), which is why he can declare them beforehand."
NABRE,23,41,25,[6] I summon him: Cyrus.
NABRE,23,42,1,"[1] 42:1-4 Servant: three other passages have been popularly called ""servant of the Lord"" poems: <a href='/NABRE/23/49/1'>49:1-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/50/4'>50:4-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/52/13'>52:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>53:12</a>. Whether the servant is an individual or a collectivity is not clear (e.g., contrast <a href='/NABRE/23/49/3'>49:3</a> with <a href='/NABRE/23/49/5'>49:5</a>). More important is the description of the mission of the servant. In the early Church and throughout Christian tradition, these poems have been applied to Christ; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/12/18'>MAT 12:18-21</a>."
NABRE,23,42,3,[2] Bruised reed…: images to express the gentle manner of the servants mission.

NABRE,23,42,15,"[5] 42:15-16 Active once more, God will remove the obstacles that hinder the exiles return, and will lead them by new roads to Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/3'>40:3-4</a>."
NABRE,23,42,18,"[6] 42:18-20 The Lord rebukes his people for their failures, but their role and their mission endure: they remain his servant, his messenger to the nations."
NABRE,23,42,22,[7] A people: Israel in exile.
NABRE,23,42,24,"[8] Plunderers: the Assyrians and Babylonians. We…they: the switch from first- to third-person speech, though puzzling, does not obscure the fact that ""the people"" is meant."
NABRE,23,43,3,[1] 43:3-4 Egypt…Ethiopia and Seba: countries which God permitted the Persians to conquer in return for having given Israel its freedom.
NABRE,23,43,9,"[2] Who among them…?: God, and only God, can foretell the future because it is he who brings it to pass. The argument from prediction is an important theme in Second Isaiah and occurs also in <a href='/NABRE/23/41/22'>41:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/10'>43:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/44/7'>44:7-8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/44/26'>26</a>."
NABRE,23,43,10,"[3] You are my witnesses: Israels role as chosen people now takes a new turn as they are given the active role of bearing witness before humankind to the Lords role in history by proclaiming events beforehand and bringing them to pass; see also <a href='/NABRE/23/44/8'>44:8</a>. The false gods, on the other hand, cannot produce such witnesses (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/43/9'>9</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/44/9'>44:9</a>). I am he: this formula of self-identification, repeated in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/43/13'>13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/43/25'>25</a>, is used here to support the assertion that the Lord alone is God; see also <a href='/NABRE/23/41/4'>41:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/46/4'>46:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/48/12'>48:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/12'>51:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/52/6'>52:6</a>. This expression in part may be behind the self-identification formula used by Jesus in Johns gospel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/8/58'>JHN 8:58</a>). Before…after: another example of the same assertion, that the Lord alone is God; see also note on <a href='/NABRE/23/44/6'>44:6</a>."
NABRE,23,43,14,[4] 43:14-17 The destruction of Babylon is described in language that recalls the drowning of the Egyptian army in the Red Sea (<a href='/NABRE/2/14/1'>EXO 14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/15/1'>15</a>).
NABRE,23,43,18,[5] Remember not: Gods new act of delivering Israel from the Babylonian captivity is presented as so great a marvel as to eclipse even the memory of the exodus from Egypt. This comparison of the return from Babylon to the exodus from Egypt recurs throughout Second Isaiah (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/41/17'>41:17-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/18'>43:18-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/48/20'>48:20-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/49/8'>49:8-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>51:9-11</a>).
NABRE,23,43,22,[6] 43:22-28 The reason for the liberation of the Israelites is not their constancy but rather Gods faithfulness to his promise (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/6'>40:6-8</a>).
NABRE,23,43,24,[7] Sweet cane: a fragrant substance used in making incense and the sacred anointing oil; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/30/23'>EXO 30:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/6/20'>JER 6:20</a>.

NABRE,23,44,6,"[4] No god but me: with Second Isaiah, Israels faith is declared to be explicitly monotheistic. However implicit it may have been, earlier formulas did not exclude the existence of other gods, not even that of the first commandment: ""You shall not have other gods besides me"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/20/3'>EXO 20:3</a>).

NABRE,23,45,13,"[7] Him: Cyrus, called by God for the deliverance and restoration of Israel. Justice: the Hebrew word (sedeq) has multiple connotations; here it relates to the saving victory that the Lord will give to Cyrus for the deliverance of his people Israel. This word and others from the same root frequently have this connotation in Second Isaiah, occurring as a parallel term with ""deliverance,"" ""salvation,"" etc. Cf. its use in <a href='/NABRE/23/41/10'>41:10</a> (rendered ""victorious"") and <a href='/NABRE/23/51/5'>51:5</a> (rendered ""victory"")."

NABRE,23,45,15,"[9] God is hidden: i.e., the one known only to Israel, who cannot be represented by wooden or molten images. The concept of the ""Deus absconditus,"" ""the hidden God,"" becomes an important theme in later theology."

NABRE,23,50,1,"[1] Responding to the peoples complaint of utter abandonment by God, the prophet asserts that their sins were responsible for their banishment.

The servant responded in fidelity but has suffered opposition (<a href='/NABRE/23/50/4'>50:4-6</a>). In this fourth oracle the servant is characterized as ""a man of suffering"" (<a href='/NABRE/23/53/3'>53:3</a>) and appears to be unjustly put to death (<a href='/NABRE/23/53/8'>53:8-9</a>). Those who have witnessed his career somehow recognize that he is innocent, has undergone suffering for their sins (<a href='/NABRE/23/53/4'>53:4-6</a>), and his death is referred to as a reparation offering (see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/53/10'>53:10-11</a>). The servant is described in ways that identify him with Israel (which is frequently referred to as ""servant"" in the context of Second Isaiah—e.g., <a href='/NABRE/23/41/8'>41:8, 9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/44/2'>44:2, 21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/4'>43:4</a>) and is designated as ""Israel"" in <a href='/NABRE/23/49/3'>49:3</a>; yet Israel outside the ""servant of the Lord"" oracles is not presented as sinless, but rather in exile because of sin (<a href='/NABRE/23/40/2'>40:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/42/21'>42:21-25</a>) and even as servant as deaf and blind (<a href='/NABRE/23/42/18'>42:18-19</a>). The servant is thus both identified with Israel and distinguished from it. As with the previous servant poems, this chapter helped the followers of Jesus to interpret his suffering, death, and resurrection; see especially the passion narratives."
NABRE,23,53,1,"[1] 53:1-10 What we have heard: this fourth servant oracle is introduced by words of the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/23/52/13'>52:13-15</a>) but is now continued by speakers who are not identified, perhaps those referred to in <a href='/NABRE/23/52/15'>52:15</a>, perhaps Israel (cf. ""struck for the sins of his people""—v. <a href='/NABRE/23/53/8'>8</a>). The Lord is again the speaker in vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/53/11'>11-13</a>."
NABRE,23,53,4,"[2] Struck down by God: the Bible often sees suffering as a punishment for sin (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/19/6/2'>PS 6:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/32/1'>32:1-5</a>), yet sin sometimes appears to go unpunished and the innocent often suffer (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/73/1'>PS 73</a>; the Book of Job). In the case of the servant, the onlookers initially judge him guilty because of his suffering but, in some way not explained, they come to understand that his sufferings are for the sins of others. One notes the element of surprise, for such vicarious suffering, in the form described here, is without parallel in the Old Testament."
NABRE,23,53,6,"[3] The Lordlaid upon him: the servants suffering is no accidental or casual matter, but part of Gods plan; see also v. <a href='/NABRE/23/53/10'>10</a>. The bystanders speculation of v. <a href='/NABRE/23/53/4'>4</a> is verified, but not in the sense intended by them."
NABRE,23,53,10,"[4] 53:10-11 Reparation offering: the Hebrew term ashamis used of a particular kind of sacrifice, one that is intended as compensation for that which is due because of guilt. See <a href='/NABRE/3/5/14'>LEV 5:14-26</a> and note. Justify: the verb means ""to be acquitted,"" ""declared innocent,"" but since the servant bears ""their iniquity,"" an effective rather than simply legal action is suggested."
NABRE,23,54,1,"[1] Jerusalem, pictured as a wife who had been barren and deserted, now suddenly finds herself with innumerable children (the returning exiles); cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/4/27'>GAL 4:27</a> for an application to a new context."
NABRE,23,54,3,"[2] Those who had taken advantage of the exile to encroach on Jerusalems territory will be driven out, and the returning exiles will repopulate the cities of Judah."
NABRE,23,54,4,"[3] 54:4-8 As with some other Old Testament themes, Second Isaiah uses that of Israel as the Lords bride in a new manner. Whereas Hosea and Jeremiah had depicted Israel as the Lords spouse to emphasize both Israels infidelity and the Lords continued love (<a href='/NABRE/28/1/1'>HOS 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/28/3/1'>3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/2/2'>JER 2:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/3/1'>3:1-15</a>) and Ezekiel to accuse Israel unsparingly (<a href='/NABRE/26/16/1'>EZE 16</a>; 23), Second Isaiah speaks only of the love with which the Lord restores the people, speaking tender words with no hint of reproach."
NABRE,23,54,5,[4] Redeemer: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/23/41/14'>41:14</a>.
NABRE,23,54,10,"[5] Covenant of peace: this whole section, vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/54/9'>9-17</a>, is given to various assurances of Gods love for Israel and of safety from various possible threats; the phrase sums up both the positive aspects of shalom, which implies a fullness of blessing, and protection from all that might harm. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/23/55/3'>55:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/25/12'>NUM 25:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/34/25'>EZE 34:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/37/26'>37:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/39/2/5'>MAL 2:5</a>."

NABRE,23,55,1,"[1] 55:1-3 The prophet invites all to return, under the figure of a banquet; cf. the covenant banquet in <a href='/NABRE/2/24/9'>EXO 24:9-11</a> and wisdoms banquet in <a href='/NABRE/20/9/1'>PRO 9:1-6</a>. The Lords covenant with David (<a href='/NABRE/10/7/1'>2SM 7</a>) is now to be extended beyond his dynasty."
NABRE,23,55,5,"[2] The ""nation"" is Persia under Cyrus, but the perspective is worldwide."
NABRE,23,55,6,"[3] 55:6-9 The invitation to seek the Lord is motivated by the mercy of a God whose ""ways"" are completely mysterious."
NABRE,23,55,10,"[4] 55:10-11 The efficacy of the word of God recalls <a href='/NABRE/23/40/5'>40:5, 8</a>."
NABRE,23,55,13,"[5] Thornbush…nettles: suggestive of the desert and therefore symbolic of suffering and hardship; cypress…myrtle: suggestive of fertile land and therefore symbolic of joy and strength. To the Lords renown: lit., ""to the name of the Lord."""
NABRE,23,56,1,"[1] 56:1-8 This poem inaugurates the final section of the Book of Isaiah, often referred to as Third or Trito-Isaiah. While Second or Deutero-Isaiah (<a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>ISA 40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/55/1'>55</a>) gave numerous references to the hopes of the community of Israel during the Babylonian exile (ca. 587-538 B.C.), Third Isaiah witnesses to the struggles and hoped-for blessings of the postexilic community now back in the homeland of Israel. In this opening poem, the references to ""keeping the sabbath"" (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/56/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/56/6'>6</a>), ""holding fast to the covenant"" (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/56/6'>6</a>) and ""Gods holy mountain"" as a house of prayer (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/7'>7</a>), all tell of the postexilic community that was establishing itself again in the land according to the pattern of Gods word given through the prophet. The poem can be classified as a ""prophetic exhortation"" in which the prophet gives instruction for those who wish to live according to Gods word and covenant. What is important to note are the conditions placed upon the people of God; while <a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>ISA 40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/55/1'>55</a> show an unconditional promise of redemption, these final chapters delineate clear expectations for receiving Gods salvific promises. Both the expectations and the great promises of God will unfold in the succeeding chapters of Third Isaiah."
NABRE,23,56,1,"[2] This opening verse echoes themes that are well known throughout the Book of Isaiah: justice and right judgment (<a href='/NABRE/23/1/27'>1:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/5/7'>5:7, 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/9/6'>9:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/16/5'>16:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/26/9'>26:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/28/17'>28:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/32/1'>32:1, 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/33/5'>33:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>42:1, 4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/42/6'>6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/8'>45:8, 13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/45/19'>19</a>), salvation and deliverance (<a href='/NABRE/23/12/3'>12:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/26/18'>26:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/33/2'>33:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/8'>45:8, 21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/46/13'>46:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/5'>51:5, 6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/51/8'>8</a>). These themes will be developed also throughout Third Isaiah."
NABRE,23,56,3,[3] Eunuchs had originally been excluded from the community of the Lord; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/23/2'>DEU 23:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/13/1'>NEH 13:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/3/14'>WIS 3:14</a>.
NABRE,23,56,5,"[4] A monument and a name: literally in Hebrew, ""a hand and a name""; a memorial inscription to prevent oblivion for one who had no children; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/18/18'>2SM 18:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/7/5'>NEH 7:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/13/14'>13:14</a>."
NABRE,23,56,7,"[5] This verse continues the theme of universalism found in <a href='/NABRE/23/49/6'>ISA 49:6</a>. As Israel was to be ""a light to the nations"" so that Gods ""salvation may reach to the ends of the earth,"" so now does that come to pass as foreigners, faithful to the divine commands, are brought to the Temple by God and joined to the covenant community of Israel."
NABRE,23,56,8,"[6] For the gathering of the dispersed people of Israel, cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/3'>JER 23:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/31/8'>31:8-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/11/17'>EZE 11:17</a>. Here the Lord not only gathers the displaced of Israel, but also unites other peoples to them. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/60/3'>ISA 60:3-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/66/18'>66:18-21</a>."
NABRE,23,56,9,"[7] 56:9-57:21 This section is made up of two pronouncements of judgment (<a href='/NABRE/23/56/9'>56:9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/57/2'>57:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/57/3'>57:3-13</a>) and an oracle of salvation (<a href='/NABRE/23/57/14'>57:14-21</a>), each of which ends with a reversal of imagery and language. While there are harsh indictments against the corrupt leaders of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/23/56/9'>56:9-12</a>), a promise of peace is offered to those who are just (<a href='/NABRE/23/57/1'>57:1-2</a>). Then the judgment and its subsequent punishment for idolaters (<a href='/NABRE/23/57/3'>57:3-13</a>a) change to an announcement of reward for those who place their trust in God (<a href='/NABRE/23/57/13'>57:13</a>c). And the promises of salvation (<a href='/NABRE/23/57/14'>57:14-19</a>) then shift to a word of warning to the wicked (<a href='/NABRE/23/57/20'>57:20-21</a>)."
NABRE,23,56,9,"[8] Beasts of the field: foreign nations, which are invited to come and ravage Israel."
NABRE,23,56,10,"[9] 56:10-11 These shepherds of Israel are without ""knowledge,"" a theme developed earlier in the Isaian corpus; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/1/3'>1:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/6/9'>6:9-10</a>. <a href='/NABRE/26/34/1'>EZE 34</a> has similar condemnatory words against the unfaithful shepherds of Israel."
NABRE,23,57,2,"[1] Despite their sad fate, the just will ultimately attain peace (most likely in this world); cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/13'>13</a>."
NABRE,23,57,3,"[2] 57:3-13 In this courtroom imagery, the idolaters are summoned before the judge (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/3'>3</a>), their crimes are graphically described (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/4'>4-11</a>), their guilt is established, and condemnation is carried out (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/12'>12-13</a>b). In contrast to this, v. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/13'>13c</a> describes the inheritance of Gods land and holy mountain given to those who place their confidence in God instead of in idols."
NABRE,23,57,3,[3] Language of sexual infidelity is often used in a figurative way to describe idolatry. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/16/15'>EZE 16:15-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/2/4'>HOS 2:4-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/3/5'>COL 3:5</a>.
NABRE,23,57,5,"[4] Child sacrifice is also attested in <a href='/NABRE/12/23/10'>2KG 23:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>JER 7:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/16/20'>EZE 16:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/20/28'>20:28, 31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/23/37'>23:37-39</a>."
NABRE,23,57,6,"[5] Smooth stones: the Hebrew word for this expression has the same consonants as the word for ""portion""; instead of making the Lord their portion (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/16/5'>PS 16:5</a>), the people adored slabs of stone which they took from the streambeds in valleys and set up as idols; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/3/9'>JER 3:9</a>. Therefore, it is implied, they will be swept away as by a sudden torrent of waters carrying them down the rocky-bottomed gorge to destruction and death without burial."
NABRE,23,57,8,"[6] Nakedness: literally in Hebrew, ""hand."" In this context, it may euphemistically refer to a phallus."
NABRE,23,57,9,"[7] The king: in Hebrew, the word for king is melek, similar in sound to the Canaanite god Molech, to whom children were offered as a sacrifice in pagan ritual. The expression ""your ambassadors"" could be a figurative expression for the children whose death served as an offering to this deity."
NABRE,23,57,12,"[8] Justice: here used sarcastically. The activity described in these verses is far from the justice which God demands of those who are aligned with the covenant (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/1'>56:1, 4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/56/6'>6</a>). In the larger context of Third Isaiah and the whole of the Isaian tradition, justice is a key theological motif. The justice to which God calls Israel will eventually come to its fulfillment in an act of divine intervention (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/60/21'>60:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/61/3'>61:3</a>c). Until then, the people of God must strive to live in the ways of justice and right judgment (<a href='/NABRE/23/56/1'>56:1</a>)."
NABRE,23,57,13,"[9] In v. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/6'>6</a>, the smooth stones of the valley are the portion which the unfaithful will receive as their due reward (cf. note on v. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/6'>6</a>); while in v. <a href='/NABRE/23/57/13'>13c</a>, an inheritance of the land and possession of Gods holy mountain will be the portion of the upright."
NABRE,23,57,14,"[10] The way…my peoples way: the language and imagery are reminiscent of <a href='/NABRE/23/40/1'>40:1-2</a>, but in this context, when the people have already returned, the physical road through the desert is replaced by the spiritual way that leads to redemption."
NABRE,23,57,15,[11] The God of Israel is presented in both a transcendent and an immanent manner. Gods holiness is the transcendent quality; the immanence is shown in the choice of dwelling among the downtrodden and humble.
NABRE,23,57,19,"[12] Creating words of comfort: lit., ""fruit of the lips,"" perhaps referring to praise and thanksgiving for the divine healing; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/14/3'>HOS 14:3</a>."
NABRE,23,58,1,"[1] 58:1-5 The prophet is commanded to condemn the formalism of the people, specifically their hypocritical fasting."
NABRE,23,58,6,[2] 58:6-12 Fasting is not genuine without reforming ones way of life. A true social morality will ensure prosperity.
NABRE,23,58,13,"[3] 58:13-14 Sabbath observance becomes a cornerstone of postexilic piety; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/2'>56:2, 4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/56/6'>6</a>."
NABRE,23,59,1,"[1] 59:1-20 This poem brings together a lament of the postexilic community and a harsh word of judgment from the prophet. After the opening rhetorical question, each of the stanzas begins with a reference to the justice and right judgment which are lacking among the people (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/59/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/59/9'>9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/59/14'>14</a>). Toward the end of the poem, God is depicted as a Divine Warrior (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/59/16'>16-20</a>) who is the only one who can intervene in order to bring redemption. This same Divine Warrior imagery is repeated in a similar fashion in <a href='/NABRE/23/63/1'>63:1-6</a>."
NABRE,23,59,5,"[2] 59:5-6 The eggs signify evil works, doing positive harm; the webs are devices that serve no useful purpose."
NABRE,23,59,9,"[3] 59:9-15 The turning point in the poem comes when the people acknowledge their transgressions and describe the horror of their present state. Light is a metaphor for salvation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/9/1'>9:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/42/16'>42:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>60:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/60/19'>19-20</a>) and darkness represents sin and disaster."
NABRE,23,59,21,[4] This verse makes the transition from chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/1'>56</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/59/1'>59</a> to chaps. <a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>60</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/62/1'>62</a>. Oracles of judgment yield to oracles about Gods redemptive action.
NABRE,23,60,1,"[1] 60:1-9 The light the prophet proclaims to Zion symbolizes the blessing to come to her: the glory of the Lord, the return of her children, the wealth of nations who themselves will walk by her light. The passage is famous from its use in the Latin liturgy for the feast of Epiphany."
NABRE,23,60,10,"[2] 60:10-18 The glorious promises for the future continue: the wealth of the nations (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/60/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/60/10'>10</a>), tribute from kings, glorification of the Temple, peace and justice (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/85/11'>PS 85:11</a>)."
NABRE,23,60,19,"[3] 60:19-20 The theme of light is taken up again, but in an apocalyptic vein: the Lords radiant presence replaces physical light."
NABRE,23,61,1,"[1] 61:1-2 The prophet proclaims that he has been anointed by the Lord to bring good news (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/9'>40:9</a>) to the afflicted and to comfort Zion. The background to the ""year of favor"" is the jubilee year of release from debts (<a href='/NABRE/3/25/10'>LEV 25:10-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/49/8'>ISA 49:8</a>)."
NABRE,23,61,6,"[2] The bestowal of a new name suggests a new identity and mission. The whole people will be priests (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/6'>EXO 19:6</a>), even ministering to nations who will serve Gods people."
NABRE,23,61,7,[3] Twofold: Israel was punished double for infidelity (<a href='/NABRE/23/40/2'>40:2</a>); the blessings of its restoration will also be double.
NABRE,23,61,10,[4] 61:10-11 The new life of the restored Zion is expressed in nuptial (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/23/62/5'>62:5</a>) and agricultural (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/23/61/3'>3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/21'>60:21</a>) imagery.
NABRE,23,62,1,"[1] 62:1-12 As in chap. <a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>60</a>, the prophet addresses Zion, announcing the reversal of her fortune. Several motifs reappear: light and glory (<a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>60:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/60/19'>19-20</a>), tribute of nations (<a href='/NABRE/23/60/11'>60:11</a>), and especially the marriage (<a href='/NABRE/23/61/10'>61:10</a>; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/23/54/5'>54:5-8</a>)."
NABRE,23,62,8,[2] 62:8-9 Peace and prosperity are indicated by the absence of invaders who would live off the land.
NABRE,23,62,10,"[3] 62:10-11 The gates of Babylon are to be opened for the exiles to return, led by the Lord, as in <a href='/NABRE/23/40/3'>40:3-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/40/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,23,63,1,"[1] 63:1-6 Two questions are raised at the approach of a majestic figure coming from Edom. It is the Lord, his garments red with the blood from the judgment battle. Edom (its capital Bozrah) plundered Judah after the fall of Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/34/5'>34:5-17</a>. Wine press: here a symbol of a bloody judgment; cf. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/15'>LAM 1:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/4/13'>JOE 4:13</a>."
NABRE,23,63,7,"[2] 63:7-64:11 This lament of the exilic community recalls Gods protection, and especially the memories of the exodus (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/63/7'>7-14</a>), before begging the Lord to come once more to their aid (<a href='/NABRE/23/63/15'>63:15</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/64/3'>64:3</a>), as they confess their sins (<a href='/NABRE/23/64/4'>64:4-11</a>). The prayer is marked by Gods ""holy spirit"" (<a href='/NABRE/23/63/10'>63:10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/63/14'>14</a>) and fatherhood (<a href='/NABRE/23/63/8'>63:8, 9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/63/16'>16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/64/7'>64:7</a>)."
NABRE,23,63,17,[3] The hardening of the heart (<a href='/NABRE/2/4/21'>EXO 4:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/7/3'>7:3</a>) serves to explain Israels sins—a motif to induce the Lord to relent.
NABRE,23,63,19,"[4] 63:19-64:3 A new theophany, like Sinai of old, is invoked so that Israels enemies will be humbled by Gods intervention."
NABRE,23,64,2,"[1] The translation here omits some words repeated in the Hebrew from <a href='/NABRE/23/63/19'>63:19</a> (""would that you would come down, with the mountains trembling before you"")."
NABRE,23,64,7,"[2] 64:7-11 The motifs of father (<a href='/NABRE/23/63/16'>63:16</a>) and creator (clay and potter, <a href='/NABRE/23/29/16'>29:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/45/9'>45:9</a>) are adduced to move the Lord to action in view of the damage done to his ""holy cities"" and ""glorious house."""
NABRE,23,65,1,"[1] 65:1-7 These verses serve as a response to the preceding questions about Gods inaction (<a href='/NABRE/23/64/6'>64:6, 11</a>). It is not God who has been absent, but the people who have walked away from God by idolatrous acts and rituals (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/65/3'>3-4</a>). That is the reason for their punishment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/65/6'>6-7</a>)."
NABRE,23,65,5,[2] Render you holy: unclean food is what these people claim has made them sacred! The prophet ridicules them. Sacredness was understood as something communicable (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/9'>EXO 19:9-15</a>).
NABRE,23,65,8,[3] This verse reflects the remnant theology found elsewhere in the Book of Isaiah: <a href='/NABRE/23/1/8'>1:8-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/4/3'>4:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/6/11'>6:11-13</a>; etc.
NABRE,23,65,11,"[4] 65:11-12 Destiny: the play on words is found in the Hebrew, in which ""destiny"" and ""destine"" are menîand manîthî."
NABRE,23,65,16,"[5] God of truth: lit., ""God of Amen,"" i.e., the one who keeps his word."
NABRE,23,65,17,"[6] 65:17-18 The new creation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/66/22'>66:22</a>) is described with apocalyptic exuberance: long life, material prosperity, and so forth. As the former events in <a href='/NABRE/23/43/18'>43:18</a> are to be forgotten, so also the new creation wipes out memory of the first creation."
NABRE,23,65,25,[7] The imagery reflects the ideal era described in <a href='/NABRE/23/11/6'>11:6-9</a>; see note there.
NABRE,23,66,1,[1] 66:1-2 The Lord rejects the abuses associated with Temple worship in order to emphasize his concern for the sincere worshiper.
NABRE,23,66,3,"[2] 66:3-6 The sacrificial abuses listed will only merit punishment. The true worshipers, the downtrodden, are those who ""tremble"" (vv. <a href='/NABRE/23/66/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/66/5'>5</a>) at Gods word. Although they are ridiculed by those who reject them (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/66/5'>5</a>), the latter will be afflicted with divine punishment; their ""choice"" will be met by the Lords choice (v. <a href='/NABRE/23/66/4'>4</a>)."
NABRE,23,66,7,"[3] 66:7-9 The renewal of Zion is pictured in terms of a miraculous, instantaneous birth, facilitated by Gods intervention."
NABRE,23,66,10,"[4] 66:10-16 The poet addresses the children born of Jerusalem, their mother. In v. <a href='/NABRE/23/66/13'>13</a> the metaphor switches to the Lord as mother (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/49/15'>49:15</a>), comforting her charges but destroying the enemies."
NABRE,23,66,17,[5] This verse seems to have some connection with <a href='/NABRE/23/65/2'>65:2-3</a>.
NABRE,23,66,18,"[6] 66:18-21 God summons the neighboring nations to Zion and from among them will send some to far distant lands to proclaim the divine glory. All your kin: Jews in exile. The ""gathering of the people and the nations"" is an eschatological motif common in the prophetic tradition; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/8'>56:8</a>."
NABRE,23,66,24,"[7] Gods enemies lie dead outside the walls of the New Jerusalem; just as in the past, corpses, filth and refuse lay in the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna) outside the city; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/34/1'>34:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/10'>2KG 23:10</a>."
NABRE,24,1,1,"[1] Anathoth: a village about three miles northeast of Jerusalem, to which Solomon had exiled Abiathar the priest (<a href='/NABRE/11/2/26'>1KG 2:26-27</a>); it is likely that Jeremiah belonged to that priestly family."
NABRE,24,1,5,"[2] Jeremiah was destined to become a prophet before his birth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/49/1'>ISA 49:1, 5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/1/15'>LUK 1:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/1/15'>GAL 1:15-16</a>. I knew you: I loved you and chose you. I dedicated you: I set you apart to be a prophet. The nations: the neighbors of Judah, along with Assyria, Babylonia, and Egypt."
NABRE,24,1,6,"[3] I am too young: like Moses (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/11'>EXO 3:11, 13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/4/10'>4:10</a>), Jeremiah at first resists Gods call. This narrative is perhaps patterned after the story of Moses call in order to identify Jeremiah as the prophet ""like me"" in <a href='/NABRE/5/18/15'>DEU 18:15</a>."
NABRE,24,1,11,"[4] There is wordplay between the Hebrew noun shaqed, ""almond tree,"" and the Hebrew verb shoqed, ""watcher/watching."" Because the almond tree begins to bloom in late winter in Palestine, it is called ""the watcher"" for the coming of spring. God is also ""watcher,"" observing the fulfillment of the prophetic word."
NABRE,24,1,13,[5] Kettle…the north: symbol of an invasion from the north; cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/1/14'>14-15</a>.
NABRE,24,2,1,"[1] 2:1-3:5 These chapters may contain some of Jeremiahs early preaching. He portrays Israel as the wife of the Lord, faithful only in the beginning, when she walked behind him (<a href='/NABRE/24/2/2'>2:2-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/24/2/5'>5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/3/1'>3:1</a>). Consistent with the marriage metaphor, he describes her present unfaithfulness as adultery (<a href='/NABRE/24/2/20'>2:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/3/2'>3:2-3</a>); now she walks behind the Baals."
NABRE,24,2,2,"[2] Devotion: Heb. hesed; Israels gratitude, fidelity, and love for God."
NABRE,24,2,3,"[3] First fruits: the first yield of a harvest offered as a sign of dependence on and gratitude toward the Lord of the land, thus divine property. Israel, then, is a gift made to God, set apart for his use; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/23/19'>EXO 23:19</a>."
NABRE,24,2,8,[4] Experts in the law: the priests. The shepherds: the kings and nobles.
NABRE,24,2,10,[5] Kedar: a nomadic tribe in north Arabia. Cyprus and Kedar represent west and east.
NABRE,24,2,14,"[6] House-born servant: one born in the masters house, in contrast to a slave acquired by purchase or as a captive; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/22/11'>LEV 22:11</a>."
NABRE,24,2,16,"[7] Memphis: the capital of Lower Egypt. Tahpanhes: a frontier city of Egypt, east of the Delta. Shave the crown of your head: an image for Egypt plundering Judah; perhaps a reference to the capture of King Jehoahaz in 609 B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/34'>2KG 23:34</a>)."
NABRE,24,2,18,"[8] Egypt and Assyria were the competing foreign powers favored by rival parties within Judah. The desire for such foreign alliances is a further desertion of the Lord, the source of living waters (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/2/13'>13</a>), in favor of the above-named powers, symbolized by the waters of the Nile and the Euphrates rivers."
NABRE,24,2,20,"[9] Served as a prostitute: idolatry (because Israel is the ""bride"" of God); cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/2/2'>2-3</a>."
NABRE,24,2,23,"[10] The Valley: probably Ben-hinnom, south of Jerusalem, site of the sanctuary of Topheth, where children were sacrificed to Molech; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>7:31</a>."
NABRE,24,3,1,"[1] Can she return to the first?: i.e., her first husband. Here the Hebrew is emended in light of the Septuagint and <a href='/NABRE/5/24/1'>DEU 24:1-4</a>, which forbids a man to take back a woman once he has divorced her. The prophet uses this analogy to illustrate the presumption of Judah, the unfaithful wife, who assumes she can easily return to the Lord after worshiping other gods."
NABRE,24,3,2,[2] An Arabian: here depicted as a marauder lying in wait for caravans.
NABRE,24,3,14,"[3] 3:14-18 A remnant of Israel (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/3/14'>14</a>) will reunite with Judah (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/3/18'>18</a>). The former Israelite community, represented by the ark of the covenant, will be replaced by a universal alliance, symbolized by Jerusalem, the Lords throne, to which all nations will be gathered (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/3/17'>17</a>)."
NABRE,24,3,24,"[4] The shameful thing: Heb. bosheth(""shame""), a term often substituted for the name of Baal, a Canaanite god worshiped at local shrines."
NABRE,24,4,2,"[1] As the Lordlives: this oath, made sincerely, implies Israels return and loyal adherence to God. Thus the ancient promises are fulfilled; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/12/3'>GEN 12:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/18/18'>18:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/22/18'>22:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/26/4'>26:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/72/17'>PS 72:17</a>."
NABRE,24,4,4,"[2] The external rite of circumcision accomplishes nothing unless it is accompanied by the removal of blindness and obstinacy of heart. Jeremiahs view is reflected in <a href='/NABRE/45/2/25'>ROM 2:25, 29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/7/19'>1CO 7:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/5/6'>GAL 5:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/6/13'>6:13, 15</a>."
NABRE,24,4,10,"[3] You really did deceive: Jeremiah complains that the Lord misled the people by fostering their complacency, leaving them unprepared and unrepentant as judgment approaches."
NABRE,24,4,11,"[4] My daughter, the people: the covenant people personified as a young woman. <a href='/NABRE/26/16/1'>EZE 16</a> presents Israel and Judah as female infants whom the Lord adopts and then abandons and punishes because they desire other lords."
NABRE,24,4,19,[5] 4:19-21 Probably the prophets own anguish at the coming destruction of Judah.
NABRE,24,5,12,[1] They denied the Lord: the people act as though God does not matter and will not interfere.
NABRE,24,5,24,"[2] Rain early and late: autumn and spring rains respectively. Appointed weeks of harvest: the seven weeks between the Passover (<a href='/NABRE/5/16/9'>DEU 16:9-10</a>) and the feast of Weeks (Pentecost), when it did not ordinarily rain."
NABRE,24,6,3,[1] Shepherds come with their flocks: foreign invaders with their armies.
NABRE,24,6,16,[2] Pathways of old: history and the lessons to be learned from it.
NABRE,24,6,17,"[3] Watchmen: the prophets who, like Jeremiah, had upheld Gods moral law."
NABRE,24,6,27,"[4] 6:27-30 God appoints Jeremiah to be a ""tester"" of his people. The passage uses the metaphor of the refining of silver: the silver was extracted from lead ore, but the process in ancient times was inexact, so that sometimes all that was left was a scummy mess, to be thrown out."
NABRE,24,7,1,[1] 7:1-15 The Temple of the Lord will not guarantee safety against enemy invasion or any other misfortune.
NABRE,24,7,6,[2] The alien: specially protected within Israelite society; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/22/20'>EXO 22:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/9/14'>NUM 9:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/15/14'>15:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/5/14'>DEU 5:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/28/43'>28:43</a>.
NABRE,24,7,12,"[3] Shiloh: an important sanctuary where the ark of the covenant was kept, according to the Books of Joshua, Judges, and 1 Samuel. In response to the corrupt behavior of the priests serving there, God allows the Philistines to destroy Shiloh and take the ark of the covenant. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/1/9'>1SM 1:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/4/3'>4:3-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/78/60'>PS 78:60</a>, <a href='/NABRE/19/78/68'>68-69</a>."
NABRE,24,7,18,"[4] Queen of Heaven: probably Astarte, goddess of fertility (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/31/10'>1SM 31:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/11/5'>1KG 11:5</a>), worshiped particularly by women (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/44/15'>JER 44:15-19</a>). Such worship was evidently reinforced during the reign of King Manasseh (<a href='/NABRE/12/21/3'>2KG 21:3-7</a>) and was revived after Josiahs death."
NABRE,24,7,22,[5] I gave them no command: right conduct rather than formal ritual was Gods will concerning his people (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/7/23'>23</a>).
NABRE,24,7,29,"[6] Hair: the unshorn hair of the nazirite, regarded as sacred because of a vow, temporary or permanent, to abstain from cutting or shaving the hair; nazirites also avoided contact with a corpse and with all products of the vine; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/6/4'>NUM 6:4-8</a>. The cutting of this hair was a sign of extreme mourning."
NABRE,24,7,31,"[7] Valley of Ben-hinnom: this valley was probably south of Jerusalem. Topheth: perhaps, ""fire pit."""
NABRE,24,8,2,"[1] Host of heaven: the stars, worshiped by other nations and even by the inhabitants of Jerusalem, particularly during the reigns of Manasseh and Amon."
NABRE,24,8,8,[2] Lying pen of the scribes: because the teachings and interpretations of the scribes ran counter to the word of the Lord.
NABRE,24,8,11,[3] Daughter of my people: see note on <a href='/NABRE/24/4/11'>4:11</a>.
NABRE,24,8,22,[4] Gilead: a region southeast of the Sea of Galilee noted for its healing balm.
NABRE,24,9,3,"[1] Jacob, the supplanter: in Hebrew, a play on words. In the popular etymology given in <a href='/NABRE/1/25/26'>GEN 25:26</a>, the name Jacob means ""he supplants,"" for he deprived his brother Esau of his birthright (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/25/33'>GEN 25:33</a>)."
NABRE,24,9,25,"[2] Shave their temples: some Arabian tribes practiced this custom. None of the nations who practice circumcision understand the meaning of their action, not even Israel; no one conforms to life under the covenant."
NABRE,24,10,2,"[1] Signs in the heavens: phenomena in the sky, such as eclipses or comets, used to predict disasters."
NABRE,24,10,11,[2] This verse is in Aramaic.
NABRE,24,12,3,"[1] Jeremiah calls the Lord to account for allowing the wicked to flourish while he himself is persecuted for his fidelity to the Lords mission; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/20/12'>20:12</a>. See Jesus judgment, <a href='/NABRE/41/9/42'>MAK 9:42</a>. The metaphors indicate that Jeremiah has even greater trials ahead of him."
NABRE,24,12,14,"[2] My evil neighbors: nations surrounding Israel, the land belonging to the Lord; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/8/8'>ISA 8:8</a>."
NABRE,24,13,1,"[1] 13:1-11 In this symbolic action, Jeremiah probably went to the village and spring of Parah, two and a half miles northeast of Anathoth, whose name closely resembled the Hebrew name of the river Euphrates (Perath), in order to dramatize the religious corruption of Judah at the hands of the Babylonians."
NABRE,24,13,25,"[2] Heb. sheqer: lit., ""deception,"" often used to designate an idol."
NABRE,24,15,13,"[1] 15:13-14 Though the wording of these verses is close to that in <a href='/NABRE/24/17/3'>17:3-4</a>, the present passage is evidently Gods word to Jeremiah, whereas <a href='/NABRE/24/17/3'>17:3-4</a> is evidently a word of judgment on Judah. It is noteworthy that the references to ""you"" in the present passage are singular, until a shift to plural in ""against you"" in the last line; this ""you"" is then doubtless a reference to both the prophet and his enemies."
NABRE,24,16,6,[1] 16:6-7 These verses refer to popular mourning practices in the land; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/14/1'>DEU 14:1-2</a>.
NABRE,24,17,19,"[1] The Gate of Benjamin: this gate, probably part of the Temple area, is otherwise unknown."
NABRE,24,18,1,"[1] 18:1-12 The lesson of the potter is that God has the power to destroy or restore, changing his plans accordingly as these nations disobey him or fulfill his will. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/32/3/10'>JON 3:10</a>."
NABRE,24,18,14,"[2] Lebanon: here apparently including Mount Hermon, whose snow-capped peak can be seen from parts of Palestine all year round. The prophet contrasts the certainties of nature with Israels unnatural desertion of the Lord for idols (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/18/15'>15</a>)."
NABRE,24,18,16,"[3] Hissing: in some ancient Near Eastern cultures hissing was not only a sign of derision but a magical means of keeping demons away; people hissed in order to ward off danger, like whistling in a cemetery."
NABRE,24,18,21,"[4] Give their children: often an extended family is meant, to be rewarded or punished as a unit."
NABRE,24,19,2,"[1] Potsherd Gate: perhaps in the south wall of Jerusalem, through which potsherds and other refuse were thrown into the Valley of Ben-hinnom."
NABRE,24,19,6,[2] Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>7:31</a>.
NABRE,24,20,1,"[1] Chief officer in the house of the Lord: head of the Temple police; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/29/26'>29:26</a>. By entering the Temple court (<a href='/NABRE/24/19/14'>19:14</a>), Jeremiah had put himself under Pashhurs jurisdiction."
NABRE,24,20,3,[2] Terror on every side: the name indicates the siege that will beset Jerusalem.
NABRE,24,20,4,"[3] Babylon: mentioned here for the first time in Jeremiah as the land of exile. The prophecy dates from after 605 B.C., when Nebuchadnezzar defeated Egypt and made the Babylonian (Chaldean) empire dominant in Syria and Palestine."
NABRE,24,20,7,[4] You seduced me: Jeremiah accuses the Lord of having deceived him; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/15/18'>15:18</a>.
NABRE,24,20,14,"[5] 20:14-18 Deception, sorrow and terror have brought the prophet to the point of despair; nevertheless he maintains confidence in God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/20/11'>11-13</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/3/3'>JOB 3:3-12</a>."
NABRE,24,21,1,"[1] Zedekiah: brother of Jehoiakim, appointed king by Nebuchadnezzar after he had carried Jehoiachin away to captivity (<a href='/NABRE/12/24/17'>2KG 24:17</a>). Pashhur: different from the one in <a href='/NABRE/24/20/1'>20:1-3</a> but also one of Jeremiahs enemies; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/38/1'>38:1, 4</a>."
NABRE,24,21,10,"[2] Jeremiah consistently pointed out the uselessness of resistance to Babylon, since the Lord had delivered Judah to Nebuchadnezzar (<a href='/NABRE/24/27/6'>27:6</a>). Because of this the prophet was denounced and imprisoned as a traitor (<a href='/NABRE/24/37/13'>37:13-14</a>)."
NABRE,24,21,11,"[3] 21:11-23:8 This section contains an editors collection of Jeremiahs oracles against the kings of Judah. They are placed in the chronological order of the kings, and are prefaced by oracles against the kings of Judah in general (<a href='/NABRE/24/21/11'>21:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/24/22/9'>22:9</a>)."
NABRE,24,21,13,"[4] Ruler of the Valley, Rock of the Plain: Mount Zion, surrounded by valleys, was regarded by the royal house as impregnable. Despite this natural fortification, God derides it as no more than a rock rising from the plain, useless against the attack of his fury."
NABRE,24,21,14,"[5] Its forest: probably the royal palace, built of cedar wood; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/14'>22:14</a>; in <a href='/NABRE/11/7/2'>1KG 7:2</a> the palace is called ""the house of the forest of Lebanon."""
NABRE,24,22,10,"[1] Him who is dead: Josiah. His successor, Jehoahaz, was deported by Pharaoh Neco to Egypt, where he died (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/33'>2KG 23:33-34</a>)."
NABRE,24,22,11,"[2] Shallum: i.e., Jehoahaz; cf. <a href='/NABRE/13/3/15'>1CH 3:15</a>. This may have been his name at birth, in which case Jehoahaz would have been his throne name."
NABRE,24,22,13,"[3] Without pay: either by forced labor in public works, or by defrauding the workers. Despite the impoverishment caused in Judah by the payment of foreign tribute, Jehoiakim embarked on a building program in Jerusalem (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/14'>14</a>); cedar was an expensive building material which had to be imported. Social injustice is the cause of much of the prophetic condemnation of the kings (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/17'>17</a>)."
NABRE,24,22,15,"[4] 22:15-16 The rule of Josiah, Jehoiakims father, shows that authentic kingship is rooted in knowledge of the Lord and creates a society in which the most disadvantaged can expect and receive justice."
NABRE,24,22,18,"[5] ""Alas! my brother""; ""Alas! sister"": customary cries of mourning."
NABRE,24,22,19,"[6] The burial of a donkey: no burial at all, except to be cast outside the city as refuse. This prophecy describes the popular feeling toward Jehoiakim rather than the actual circumstances of his burial. According to <a href='/NABRE/12/24/5'>2KG 24:5</a> he was buried with his ancestors in Jerusalem."
NABRE,24,22,20,"[7] 22:20-23 The prophet first bids Jerusalem to scale Lebanon, Bashan, and Abarim, i.e., the highest surrounding mountains to the north, northeast, and southeast, and gaze on the ruin of its lovers, i.e., the false leaders of Judah, called its shepherds (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/22'>22</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/2/8'>2:8</a>. Jerusalem still stands (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/23'>23</a>), apparently as secure as the heights of Lebanon, but destruction is to follow (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/6'>6</a>)."
NABRE,24,22,24,"[8] Coniah: a shortened form of Jeconiah, the name Jeremiah gives King Jehoiachin (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/24/1'>24:1</a>). A signet ring: the seal used by kings and other powerful figures—a symbol of their power and status—mounted in a ring worn constantly on the hand. The Lord says that even were Jehoiachin such a precious possession, he would reject him. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/23'>HAG 2:23</a> uses the same imagery to signal the restoration of Zerubbabel. The words in <a href='/NABRE/24/22/24'>JER 22:24-30</a> date from the short three-month reign of Jehoiachin, before he was deported by Nebuchadnezzar."
NABRE,24,22,26,"[9] You and the mother who bore you: the queen mother held a special position in the monarchy of Judah, and in the Books of Kings she is invariably mentioned by name along with the king (<a href='/NABRE/11/15/2'>1KG 15:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/18/2'>2KG 18:2</a>). Jehoiachin did indeed die in Babylon."
NABRE,24,22,30,"[10] Childless: Jehoiachin is considered childless because none of his seven sons became king. His grandson Zerubbabel presided for a time over the Judahite community after the return from exile, but not as king. According to Ezekiel, whose oracles are dated by Jehoiachins fictitious regnal years, the people expected Jehoiachin to return. Jeremiahs prophecy dispels this hope, despite the words of Hananiah (<a href='/NABRE/24/28/4'>28:4</a>)."
NABRE,24,23,1,"[1] 23:1-8 With the false rulers (shepherds) who have governed his people the Lord contrasts himself, the true shepherd, who will in the times of restoration appoint worthy rulers (vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/1'>1-4</a>). He will provide a new king from Davids line who will rule justly, fulfilling royal ideals (vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/24/23/6'>6</a>). ""The Lord our justice"" is an ironic wordplay on the name of the weak King Zedekiah (""The Lord is justice""). Unlike Zedekiah, the future king will be true to the name he bears. Verses 7-8 may have been added during the exile."
NABRE,24,23,9,"[2] 23:9-40 After the collection of oracles against the kings, the editor of the book placed this collection of oracles against the false prophets. With them are associated the priests, for both have betrayed their trust as instructors in the ways of the Lord; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/2/8'>2:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/4/9'>4:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/6/13'>6:13-14</a>."
NABRE,24,23,14,[3] Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/24/13/25'>13:25</a>.
NABRE,24,23,17,"[4] 23:17-20 Not only are the false prophets personally immoral, but they encourage immorality by prophesying good for evildoers. The true prophet, on the other hand, sees the inevitable consequences of evil behavior."
NABRE,24,23,23,[5] 23:23-24 Near at hand only…far off: a divine claim that no one can hide from God and that God is aware of all that happens.
NABRE,24,23,28,"[6] 23:28-29 Straw…wheat: a contrast between false and true prophecy. True prophecy is also like fire (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/5/14'>5:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/20/9'>20:9</a>), producing violent results (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/29'>29</a>); Jeremiahs own life is a testimony of this."
NABRE,24,23,33,"[7] 23:33-40 A wordplay on massa, which means both ""oracle"" (usually of woe) and ""burden."" In vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/23/34'>34-40</a> the word massaitself is forbidden to the people under the meaning of a divine oracle."
NABRE,24,24,1,"[1] 24:1-10 For Jeremiah, as for Ezekiel, no good could be expected from the people who had been left in Judah under Zedekiah or who had fled into Egypt; a future might be expected only for those who would pass through the purifying experience of the exile to form the new Israel."
NABRE,24,24,1,[2] Jeconiah: alternative form of Jehoiachin (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/24/22/24'>22:24</a>).
NABRE,24,25,1,"[1] 25:1-14 The fourth year of Jehoiakim: 605 B.C. Officially, the first year of Nebuchadnezzar began the following year; but as early as his victory over Egypt at Carchemish in 605, Nebuchadnezzar wielded dominant power in the Near East. Jeremiah saw in him the fulfillment of his prophecy of the enemy to come from the north (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/1/13'>1:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/6/22'>6:22-24</a>). In vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/25/11'>11-12</a> the prophecy of the seventy years exile occurs for the first time; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/29/10'>29:10</a>. This number signifies that the present generation must die out; cf. forty in the exodus tradition (<a href='/NABRE/4/14/20'>NUM 14:20-23</a>)."
NABRE,24,25,15,[2] 25:15-17 Jeremiah is a prophet to the nations (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/1/5'>1:5</a>) as well as to his own people. All the nations mentioned here appear again in the more extensive collection of Jeremiahs oracles against the nations in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/24/46/1'>46</a>-<a href='/NABRE/24/51/1'>51</a>.
NABRE,24,25,15,"[3] Cup…wrath: a metaphor for destruction that occurs often in the Old Testament (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/11/6'>PS 11:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/75/9'>75:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/35/2/15'>HAB 2:15-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/23/31'>EZE 23:31-33</a>, etc.)."
NABRE,24,25,20,"[4] Uz: the homeland of legendary Job, in Edomite or Arabian territory."
NABRE,24,25,22,[5] The shores beyond the sea: Phoenician commercial colonies located throughout the Mediterranean world.
NABRE,24,25,23,[6] Dedan and Tema and Buz: North Arabian tribes.
NABRE,24,25,26,[7] Sheshach: a contrived word from the Hebrew letters of Babylon.
NABRE,24,26,1,[1] The beginning of the reign: a technical expression for the time between a kings accession to the throne and the beginning of his first official (calendar) year as king. Jehoiakims first regnal year was 608 B.C.
NABRE,24,26,18,"[2] Micah of Moresheth: the prophet Micah, who appears among the canonical minor prophets (cf. <a href='/NABRE/33/1/1'>MIC 1:1</a>)."
NABRE,24,26,24,"[3] Ahikam, son of Shaphan: one of Josiahs officials (<a href='/NABRE/12/22/12'>2KG 22:12</a>) and Jeremiahs friend. He was the father of Gedaliah, who was governor of Judah after Zedekiahs deportation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/39/14'>JER 39:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/40/5'>40:5-7</a>)."
NABRE,24,27,1,[1] 27:1-29:32 A special collection of Jeremiahs prophecies dealing with false prophets. Stylistic peculiarities evident in the Hebrew suggest that these three chapters once existed as an independent work.
NABRE,24,27,1,"[2] Zedekiah: The Hebrew text actually has ""Jehoiakim,"" but the content of the chapter indicates that Zedekiah is intended."
NABRE,24,27,3,"[3] The time is the fourth year of Zedekiah, 594 B.C., the occasion of a delegation from the neighboring states, doubtless for the purpose of laying plans against Nebuchadnezzar."
NABRE,24,27,9,[4] Your prophets: seers and diviners served non-Israelite kings just as the professional prophets served the kings of Judah.
NABRE,24,29,3,"[1] Elasah: probably the brother of Ahikam (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/26/24'>26:24</a>). Gemariah: probably the son of the high priest Hilkiah; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/22/4'>2KG 22:4</a>. Zedekiah had dispatched these men to Nebuchadnezzar for some other purpose, possibly the payment of tribute, but Jeremiah took advantage of their mission to send his letter with them."
NABRE,24,29,26,"[2] 29:26-29 Jeremiahs message to Shemaiah is not completely preserved in the current Hebrew text, hence the incomplete sentence in vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/29/25'>25-28</a>."
NABRE,24,30,1,"[1] 30:1-31:40 These two chapters contain salvation oracles that originally expressed the double expectation that the Lord would return the exiled survivors of the Northern Kingdom of Israel and reunite Israel and Judah as one kingdom under a just Davidic king. They were probably composed early in Josiahs reign (the reference of v. <a href='/NABRE/24/30/9'>9</a>), when he took advantage of Assyrias internal disintegration and asserted control over northern Israel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/23/15'>2KG 23:15-17</a>). With the destruction of Jerusalem, the oracles were re-worked to include Judah and their fulfillment along with the renewal of the Davidic dynasty became associated with the eschatological ""day of the Lord."""
NABRE,24,30,9,"[2] David, their king: a descendant of David (""his leader"" in v. <a href='/NABRE/24/30/21'>21</a>) who, like his ancestor, would rule a unified kingdom and ""walk in the ways of the Lord,"" as the Deuteronomistic historians claimed David did. Other prophets also refer to this idealized ruler as ""David""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/34/23'>EZE 34:23-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/37/24'>37:24-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/3/5'>HOS 3:5</a>."
NABRE,24,30,21,"[3] His leader: cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/24/30/9'>9</a>. Approach me: i.e., in the sanctuary of the Temple for worship. This new David is given a priestly function to perform on behalf of the assembly. To approach God on ones own brings death; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/16/1'>LEV 16:1-2</a>."
NABRE,24,31,2,"[1] 31:2-3 Jeremiah describes the exiles of the Northern Kingdom on their way home from the nations where the Assyrians had resettled them (722/721 B.C.). The favor they discover in the wilderness is the appearance of the Lord (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/31/3'>3</a>) coming to guide them to Jerusalem. Implicit in these verses is the presentation of the peoples return from captivity as a second exodus, a unifying theme in Second Isaiah (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/24/40/1'>40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/24/55/1'>55</a>)."
NABRE,24,31,15,"[2] Ramah: a village about five miles north of Jerusalem, where one tradition locates Rachels tomb (<a href='/NABRE/9/10/2'>1SM 10:2</a>). The wife of Jacob/Israel, Rachel is the matriarchal ancestor of Ephraim, chief among the northern tribes. She personified Israel as a mother whose grief for her lost children is especially poignant because she had to wait a long time to bear them. <a href='/NABRE/40/2/18'>MAT 2:18</a> applies this verse to Herods slaughter of the innocents."
NABRE,24,31,19,[3] Struck my thigh: a gesture signifying grief and dread (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/21/17'>EZE 21:17</a>).
NABRE,24,31,22,"[4] No satisfactory explanation has been given for this text. Jerome, for example, saw the image as a reference to the infant Jesus enclosed in Marys womb. Since Jeremiah often uses marital imagery in his description of a restored Israel, the phrase may refer to a wedding custom, perhaps women circling the groom in a dance. It may also be a metaphor describing the security of a new Israel, a security so complete that it defies the imagination and must be expressed as hyperbolic role reversal: any danger will be so insignificant that women can protect their men."
NABRE,24,31,26,[5] I awoke…satisfying: an intrusive comment.
NABRE,24,31,29,"[6] ""The parents…on edge"": Jeremiahs opponents use this proverb to complain that they are being punished for sins of their ancestors. Jeremiah, however, insists that the Lord knows the depth of their wickedness and holds them accountable for their actions."
NABRE,24,31,30,"[7] 31:31-34 The new covenant is an occasional prophetic theme, beginning with Hosea. According to Jeremiah, (a) it lasts forever; (b) its law (torah) is written in human hearts; (c) it gives everyone true knowledge of God, making additional instruction (torah) unnecessary. The Dead Sea Scroll community claimed they were partners in a ""new covenant."" The New Testament presents the death and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth as inaugurating a new covenant open to anyone who professes faith in Jesus the Christ. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/22/20'>LUK 22:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/11/25'>1CO 11:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/8/8'>HEB 8:8-12</a>. Know the Lord: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/24/22/15'>22:15-16</a>."
NABRE,24,31,37,"[8] 31:38-40 The landmarks in these verses outline the borders of Jerusalem during the time of Nehemiah: the Tower of Hananel (<a href='/NABRE/16/3/1'>NEH 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/12/39'>12:39</a>) in the northeast and the Corner Gate (<a href='/NABRE/12/14/13'>2KG 14:13</a>) in the northwest; Goah in the southeast and Gareb Hill in the southwest; the Valley of Ben-hinnom (""the Valley of corpses and ashes""), which met the Wadi Kidron in the southeast, and the Horse Gate in the eastern wall at the southeast corner of the Temple area."
NABRE,24,32,1,"[1] 32:1-44 This chapter recounts a prophecy ""in action."" At the Lords command, Jeremiah fulfills his family duty to purchase the land of his cousin, carrying out all the legal details, even putting the deed away for safekeeping against the day he will have to produce it to verify his ownership of the land. The Lord defines the meaning of this symbolic action: In the future, Judah will be restored and daily life will return to normal."
NABRE,24,32,1,[2] The tenth year of Zedekiah: 588 B.C. The eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar: dating his reign from his victory at Carchemish; see note on <a href='/NABRE/24/25/1'>25:1-14</a>.
NABRE,24,32,6,[3] 32:6-9 Jeremiahs imprisonment by the weak-willed Zedekiah was a technical custody that did not deprive him of all freedom of action.
NABRE,24,32,7,[4] The first right of purchase: the obligation of the closest relative to redeem the property of a family member in economic distress so that the ancestral land remains within the family (<a href='/NABRE/3/25/25'>LEV 25:25-28</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/8/2/20'>RUT 2:20</a>.
NABRE,24,32,11,"[5] The sealed copy…and the open copy: the legal deed of sale was written on a scroll, which was then rolled up and sealed; a second scroll containing a copy of the legal deed was then rolled around it and left unsealed so the contents of the legal deed would be accessible without destroying the original seal."
NABRE,24,32,14,[6] In an earthenware jar: to protect the scroll from drying out and disintegrating. Some of the Dead Sea Scrolls were found in such jars.
NABRE,24,32,35,"[7] Molech: a god to whom human sacrifice was offered in the Valley of Ben-hinnom. Here, as in <a href='/NABRE/24/19/5'>19:5</a>, he is called ""Baal""; see note on <a href='/NABRE/3/18/21'>LEV 18:21</a>."
NABRE,24,33,14,"[1] 33:14-26 This is the longest continuous passage in the Hebrew text of Jeremiah that is missing from the Greek text of Jeremiah. It is probably the work of a postexilic writer who applied parts of Jeremiahs prophecies to new situations. The hope for an eternal Davidic dynasty (vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/33/14'>14-17</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/7/11'>2SM 7:11-16</a>) and for a perpetual priesthood and sacrificial system (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/33/18'>18</a>) was not realized after the exile. On the canonical authority of the Septuagint, see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/13/1'>DAN 13:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/27/14/42'>14:42</a>."
NABRE,24,34,7,"[1] Lachish, and Azekah: fortress towns southwest of Jerusalem which Nebuchadnezzar besieged to prevent any help coming to Jerusalem from Egypt. At Lachish, archaeologists found several letters written on ostraca (pottery fragments) dated to 598 or 588 B.C., which mention both Lachish and Azekah."
NABRE,24,34,7,"[2] 34:8-22 During the siege of Jerusalem, its citizens made a covenant at Zedekiahs instigation to free Judahites they held in servitude, thus providing additional defenders for the city, leaving slave owners with fewer mouths to feed, and making reparation for past violations of the law, which dictated that Hebrew slaves should serve no longer than six years (<a href='/NABRE/5/15/12'>DEU 15:12-15</a>). But when the siege was temporarily lifted, when the assistance promised by Pharaoh Hophra arrived (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/37/5'>JER 37:5</a>), the inhabitants of Jerusalem broke the covenant and once more pressed their fellow citizens into slavery (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/34/11'>11</a>)."
NABRE,24,34,18,"[3] 34:18-19 Both the Old Testament (<a href='/NABRE/1/15/10'>GEN 15:10-17</a>) and the eighth century B.C. Sefire inscription indicate that sometimes contracting parties ratified an agreement by walking between dismembered animals, invoking upon themselves the animals fate if they failed to keep their word. The covenant: that mentioned in vv. <a href='/NABRE/24/34/10'>10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/24/34/15'>15</a>."
NABRE,24,35,1,[1] In the days of Jehoiakim: probably in 599 or 598 B.C. (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/24/1'>2KG 24:1-2</a>).
NABRE,24,35,2,"[2] House: both members of the family of Rechab (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/24/35/3'>3</a>) and the place where they live; cf. note on v. <a href='/NABRE/24/35/11'>11</a>. The Rechabites: traditionalists who rejected the settled agricultural and urban cultures to which other Israelites had assimilated, maintaining their loyalty to the Lord by perpetuating the semi-nomadic life of their distant ancestors (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/10/15'>2KG 10:15-17</a>). Jeremiah contrasts their adherence to their vows with the Judahites disregard for divine commands."
NABRE,24,35,4,"[3] The sons of Hanan: probably disciples of Hanan. Man of God: occurring only here in Jeremiah, the title frequently is applied to prophets: e.g., Samuel (<a href='/NABRE/9/9/6'>1SM 9:6-10</a>), Elijah (<a href='/NABRE/12/1/9'>2KG 1:9-13</a>), Elisha (<a href='/NABRE/12/4/1'>2KG 4</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/13/1'>13</a>). Whatever the function of the sons of Hanan, they encourage Jeremiah by lending him their room. Maaseiah: perhaps the father of the priest Zephaniah (<a href='/NABRE/24/29/25'>29:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/37/3'>37:3</a>). Guard at the entrance: an important priestly responsibility (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/52/24'>52:24</a>)."
NABRE,24,35,6,"[4] Jonadab: another spelling of Jehonadab, a contemporary of King Jehu; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/10/15'>2KG 10:15-17</a>."
NABRE,24,35,11,[5] The army of the Arameans: Nebuchadnezzar enlisted the help of Judahs neighbors in his assault on Jerusalem. Living in Jerusalem: the current military threat and the prospect of being killed or captured as plunder drove the Rechabites into the city and away from their tents.
NABRE,24,36,5,"[1] I am barred: Jeremiah could have been forbidden to enter the Temple for any number of reasons: e.g., his inflammatory preaching (the Temple sermon, 7:1-15; the broken pot); the hostility of Temple guards; the restrictions of arrest."
NABRE,24,36,10,[2] Gemariah: member of a family friendly to Jeremiah with rights to a room in the gateway fortress overlooking the court of the Temple. His father Shaphan had been Josiahs secretary of state (<a href='/NABRE/12/22/3'>2KG 22:3</a>). From a window in this room Baruch read Jeremiahs scroll to the people.
NABRE,24,36,12,[3] The scribes chamber: the office of the royal secretary.
NABRE,24,36,23,[4] A scribes knife: used to sharpen reed pens.
NABRE,24,36,30,"[5] Jehoiakims son Jehoiachin was named king, but reigned only three months; he was better known for his long exile in Babylon. His corpse shall be thrown out: just as Jehoiakim had thrown pieces of the scroll into the fire (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/22/19'>22:19</a>)."
NABRE,24,37,4,"[1] Put into prison: as described in <a href='/NABRE/24/32/1'>32:1-3</a>. Chronologically, the present episode follows <a href='/NABRE/24/34/1'>34:1-7</a>."
NABRE,24,37,5,"[2] Pharaohs army: the force sent by Pharaoh Hophra; when they arrived, the Chaldeans temporarily lifted the siege against Jerusalem (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/34/21'>34:21</a>)."
NABRE,24,38,1,"[1] Jeremiah enjoyed sufficient liberty in the court of the guard (<a href='/NABRE/24/37/21'>37:21</a>) to speak to the people; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/32/6'>32:6-9</a>. Gedaliah, son of Pashhur: the latter is possibly the Pashhur of <a href='/NABRE/24/20/1'>20:1</a>. Pashhur, son of Malchiah: mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/24/21/1'>21:1</a>."
NABRE,24,38,4,"[2] He is weakening the resolve: lit., ""he weakens the hands."" One of the Lachish ostraca (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/24/34/7'>34:7</a>) makes the same claim against the princes in Jerusalem."
NABRE,24,39,1,"[1] In the ninth year…in the tenth month: the month Tebet (mid-December to mid-January) of the year 589/588 B.C., according to the Babylonian calendar, whose New Year began in March/April."
NABRE,24,39,2,"[2] In the eleventh year…the ninth day of the fourth month: in July, 587 B.C."
NABRE,24,39,3,"[3] The Babylonian officers act as a military tribunal or government, headed by Nergal-sharezer, Nebuchadnezzars son and successor."
NABRE,24,39,4,"[4] By way of the kings garden: along the southeast side of the city; the royal garden was in the Kidron Valley. A gate between the two walls: the southernmost city gate, at the end of the Tyropoeon Valley. The Arabah: the southern Jordan Valley. Zedekiah was perhaps trying to escape across the Jordan when he was captured near Jericho."
NABRE,24,39,5,[5] Riblah: Nebuchadnezzars headquarters north of Damascus; Pharaoh Neco had once used the town as a military post (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/33'>2KG 23:33</a>).
NABRE,24,40,1,"[1] The word: this ""word"" does not actually appear until <a href='/NABRE/24/42/7'>42:7</a>."
NABRE,24,40,6,"[2] While Jerusalem had suffered a great deal of damage, the Babylonian leaders selection of Mizpah as their local headquarters was probably as much a symbolic statement as it was a utilitarian move: Jerusalem and its political and religious worldview had given way to disorder and no longer existed as a symbol of order."
NABRE,24,40,14,"[3] In an attempt, perhaps, to weaken Babylons hold on the area and to add Judah to the Ammonite kingdom, Baalis supported Ishmaels claim to the throne of David (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/41/1'>41:1</a> for Ishmaels genealogy)."
NABRE,24,41,10,[1] The princesses: the women of Judahs royal house.
NABRE,24,41,12,"[2] Gibeon: modern El-Jib; northwest of Jerusalem. A huge pit carved into limestone provided water in time of siege, here called the great pool, lit., ""many waters""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/2/12'>2SM 2:12-14</a>."
NABRE,24,44,2,"[1] 44:2-30 Chronologically, these are the last of Jeremiahs words to his people. As the narrative ends, Jeremiah meets with rejection. According to tradition, recorded in a much later work, he was murdered in Egypt by fellow Judahites."
NABRE,24,44,30,"[2] Hophra: killed by his own people. Hophras successor, Amasis, ruled Egypt when Nebuchadnezzar took control of the country."
NABRE,24,45,1,"[1] 45:1-5 At the conclusion of his narrative, Baruch appends a message Jeremiah had given him when he first wrote down Jeremiahs words (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/36/4'>36:4</a>). The future revealed by the prophet overwhelmed Baruch; now he learns his own safety is assured, even though the Lord will destroy Judah."
NABRE,24,46,1,[1] 46:1-51:64 A collection of oracles against foreign nations constitutes the final section of the Hebrew text of Jeremiah; in the Greek text they follow <a href='/NABRE/24/25/13'>25:13</a>. The oracles here appear to be arranged in loose chronological order: 46:2 mentions the fourth year of Jehoiakim; the oracles in <a href='/NABRE/24/50/1'>50:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/24/51/64'>51:64</a> are evidently from the end of Jeremiahs life.
NABRE,24,46,2,"[2] Carchemish on the Euphrates: the western terminus of the Mesopotamian trade route, where Nebuchadnezzar defeated Pharaoh Neco in 605 B.C., thus gaining undisputed control of Syria and Palestine."
NABRE,24,46,13,"[3] In 601 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar advanced into Egypt itself, but finally had to withdraw to Syria."
NABRE,24,46,15,"[4] Apis: the chief god of Memphis; the black bull honored as an incarnation of the god Ptah and, later, of the god Osiris."
NABRE,24,46,17,"[5] ""Braggart-missed-his-chance"": the Hebrew phrase may contain a pun on the Pharaohs name or royal title."
NABRE,24,46,18,[6] Tabor…Carmel: mountains in Palestine that seem to tower over their surroundings as Nebuchadnezzar towers over the nations in his path as he makes his way toward Egypt.
NABRE,24,46,25,[7] Amon: the sun-god worshiped at Thebes in Upper Egypt.
NABRE,24,47,2,[1] 47:2-7 Nebuchadnezzars military campaign against Ashkelon in 604 B.C. may provide some historical background for this poem.
NABRE,24,47,4,"[2] Tyre and Sidon: Phoenician seaports allied commercially with the Philistines and often rebelling against Nebuchadnezzar; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/27/1'>27:1-4</a>. After the capture of Jerusalem, Nebuchadnezzar carried out a partially successful thirteen-year siege of Tyre. Caphtor: Crete and other Aegean islands, points of origin for the Philistines and other sea peoples; cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/9/7'>AMO 9:7</a>."
NABRE,24,47,5,"[3] Baldness…gash yourself: close-cropped hair, silence, and ritual slashing of the body express mourning and grief and here represent the mourners awareness that chaos has overcome order (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/41/5'>41:5</a>)."
NABRE,24,48,1,"[1] 48:1-47 Moab, located east of the Dead Sea, was one of Israels bitter enemies (cf., e.g., <a href='/NABRE/23/15/1'>ISA 15</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/16/1'>16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/2/1'>AMO 2:1-3</a>). According to Flavius Josephus, Nebuchadnezzar conquered Moab and Ammon in his twenty-third year (582 B.C.), five years after the destruction of Jerusalem. This chapter is full of local place names in Moab."
NABRE,24,48,2,"[2] Madmen: a place name, not mentioned elsewhere in the Old Testament."
NABRE,24,48,7,[3] Chemosh: chief god of Moab (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/21/29'>NUM 21:29</a>).
NABRE,24,48,11,[4] 48:11-12 Moabite wine was known for its high quality. Here the wine is a metaphor for Moabs complacency.
NABRE,24,48,18,"[5] Dibon, the capital of Moab at that time, is situated on a height. The prophet here offers a personification of the city, pictured as a confident ruler."
NABRE,24,49,1,"[1] Milcom: chief god of the Ammonites (cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/11/5'>1KG 11:5</a>). The Ammonites shared a border with Gad, an Israelite tribe in Transjordan (<a href='/NABRE/6/13/8'>JOS 13:8-10</a>); the Ammonites occupied its territory after the collapse of the Northern Kingdom."
NABRE,24,49,6,"[2] 49:7-22 Edom: southeast of the Dead Sea, a traditional enemy who profited from Judahs downfall; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/137/7'>PS 137:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/25/4/21'>LAM 4:21-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/31/1/11'>OBA 1:11-12</a>."
NABRE,24,49,7,"[3] Teman, a district of Edom (cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/2/11'>JOB 2:11</a>), represents the whole country, which was famous for the wisdom of its sages."

NABRE,24,51,60,"[5] Jeremiah prophesied against Babylon, even as he foretold Judahs release from Babylons power (<a href='/NABRE/24/3/14'>3:14-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/32/15'>32:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/33/6'>33:6-9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/24/33/12'>12-13</a>); but his scroll against Babylon was thrown in the Euphrates (v. <a href='/NABRE/24/51/63'>63</a>).

NABRE,24,52,28,"[4] 52:28-30 These verses, missing in the Greek text, do not come from <a href='/NABRE/12/25/1'>2KG 25</a> but from a source using a different chronology. Besides the deportations of 598 and 587 B.C., this passage mentions a final deportation in 582/581, possibly a response to the murder of Gedaliah; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/41/2'>JER 41:2</a>."
NABRE,24,52,30,"[5] 52:31-34 In the year 561/560 B.C., Nebuchadnezzars successor Awel-Marduk (Evil-merodach), who reigned only two years, released Jehoiachin. Babylonian records confirm that Jehoiachin and his family were supported at public expense."
NABRE,24,52,32,[6] The other kings: heads of state brought as captives to Babylon.
NABRE,25,1,1,"[1] 1:1-22 In this poem the poet first takes on the persona of an observer describing Jerusalems abject state after the destruction wrought by the Babylonian army (vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/1'>1-11</a>a); but the detached tone gives way to a more impassioned appeal when the city itself—personified as the grieving widow and mother Zion—abruptly intrudes upon this description (vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/9'>9c</a>, <a href='/NABRE/25/1/11'>11c</a>-<a href='/NABRE/25/1/16'>16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/25/1/18'>18-22</a>) to demand that God look squarely at her misery."
NABRE,25,1,2,"[2] Lovers: language of love was typically used to describe the relationship between treaty partners, thus here it connotes Judahs allies (see v. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/19'>19</a>)."
NABRE,25,1,9,"[3] Zion breaks in on the poets description in v. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/9'>9c</a>, albeit briefly, to demand that the Lord face squarely her misery. She takes up the lament in a more sustained fashion in v. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/11'>11c</a>."
NABRE,25,2,22,"[1] 2:1-22 This chapter continues to move between the voice of the poet (vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/2/1'>1-20</a>) and that of personified Zion (vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/2/20'>20-22</a>). The persona of the poet, first portrayed in chap. <a href='/NABRE/25/1/1'>1</a> as a detached observer recounting both the desolation as well as the sins of the city, becomes in this chapter an advocate for Zion in her appeal to the Lord and never once mentions her sins."
NABRE,25,2,1,"[2] The glory of Israel: the Temple. His footstool: the ark of the covenant (<a href='/NABRE/13/28/2'>1CH 28:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/99/5'>PS 99:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/132/7'>132:7</a>); or again, the Temple (<a href='/NABRE/26/43/7'>EZE 43:7</a>)."

NABRE,25,2,8,"[5] The measuring line: normally used for building, here employed ironically as an instrument of destruction; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/34/11'>ISA 34:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/21/13'>2KG 21:13</a>."
NABRE,25,2,10,[6] They cast dust: as a sign of mourning; cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/7/6'>JOS 7:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/2/12'>JOB 2:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/27/30'>EZE 27:30</a>.
NABRE,25,2,11,"[7] My eyes are spent with tears, my stomach churns: the poet appropriates the emotional language used by Zion in <a href='/NABRE/25/1/16'>1:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/25/1/20'>1:20</a> to express a progressively stronger commitment to her cause. After describing the systematic dismantling of the city in vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/2/5'>5-9</a>, the poet turns to the plight of the inhabitants in vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/2/10'>10-12</a>. It is the description of children dying in the streets that finally brings about the poets emotional breakdown, even as it did for Zion in <a href='/NABRE/25/1/16'>1:16</a>."
NABRE,25,2,13,"[8] To what can I compare you…?: the author calls attention to the poetic task: to find language that speaks adequately of the atrocities and incomparable suffering experienced by Zion, and thus to attempt to offer comfort."
NABRE,25,2,19,"[9] The poet urges Zion to appeal to the Lord once more on behalf of her dying children. The image of Zions children effectively condenses the metaphorical sense of all residents of the city (young and old alike) into the more poignant picture of actual children at the point of death. It was precisely this image, no doubt well known to survivors of besieged cities, that led to the emotional breakdown of both Zion (<a href='/NABRE/25/1/16'>1:16</a>) and the poet (<a href='/NABRE/25/2/11'>2:11</a>). The hope is that the Lord will be similarly affected by such a poignant image and respond with mercy."
NABRE,25,2,20,[10] Must women eat their own offspring: extreme famine in a besieged city sometimes led to cannibalism; this becomes a stereotypical way of expressing the nearly unthinkable horrors of war; cf. <a href='/NABRE/25/4/10'>LAM 4:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/28/53'>DEU 28:53</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/6/28'>2KG 6:28-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/73/2/3'>BAR 2:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/5/10'>EZE 5:10</a>.
NABRE,25,3,22,"[1] 3:1-66 This chapter is focused less on the destruction of Jerusalem than are chaps. 1 and 2 and more on the suffering of an individual. The identity of the individual is never given, and one probably should not search for a specific identification of the speaker. The figure of the representative sufferer makes concrete the pain of the people in a way similar to the personification of Zion as a woman in chaps. 1 and 2. Indeed, in vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/3/40'>40-48</a> the individual voice gives way to a communal voice, returning in vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/3/49'>49-66</a> to the individual sufferer."
NABRE,25,3,21,"[2] 3:21-24 In the midst of a description of suffering, the speaker offers this brief but compelling statement of hope in Gods ultimate mercy. It is a hard-won and precarious hope, nearly submerged by the volume and intensity of the surrounding lament, but it is hope nonetheless."
NABRE,25,3,29,[3] To put ones mouth in the dust: a sign of humiliation and submission; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/25/3/16'>16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/72/9'>PS 72:9</a>.
NABRE,25,3,40,[4] 3:40-66 The plural voice in this lament suggests that a communal lament begins here; it then continues in the singular voice in vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/3/55'>55-66</a>.
NABRE,25,3,48,"[5] 3:48-51 These verses are more appropriate on the lips of the poet, who speaks of ""my city"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/25/3/51'>51</a>). Daughters of my city: here as elsewhere ""daughter"" may refer to villages dependent on a larger city."
NABRE,25,4,1,"[1] This chapter returns to the focus of chaps. 1 and 2, namely the horrors of a siege. Unlike chaps. 1 and 2, however, the character of personified Zion never interrupts the voice of the poet to protest her abject state. As a result, the emotion of the poem is less intense, while at the same time seeming more grim on account of its lack of petition to the Lord."
NABRE,25,4,1,"[2] 4:1-2 Jewels: lit., ""holy stones."" These precious things designate the children who are abandoned, starving, and killed in the siege of Jerusalem (cf. <a href='/NABRE/38/9/16'>ZEC 9:16</a>). Another explanation is that these are the stones of the destroyed Temple."
NABRE,25,4,3,"[3] Cruel as the ostrich: see note on <a href='/NABRE/18/39/14'>JOB 39:14-16</a>. Jerusalem, in her distress, has abandoned her children."
NABRE,25,4,5,"[4] Crimson: a sign of luxury. Tyrian purple, a red-purple or blue-purple dye produced from shellfish, was very expensive and the only colorfast dye in the ancient Near East. Thus purple or crimson cloth was available only to the wealthy."
NABRE,25,4,17,"[5] A nation: probably Egypt, which failed to give effective aid against Babylon."
NABRE,25,4,20,"[6] Our very lifebreath: lit., ""the breath of our nostrils,"" that is, the king. This expression occurs in Egyptian texts of the late second millennium B.C., and may have survived as a royal epithet in the Jerusalem court. After the disaster of 598 B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/12/24/1'>2KG 24:1-17</a>), Jerusalem could have hoped to live in peace amidst her neighbors; but they (vv. <a href='/NABRE/25/4/21'>21-22</a>) as well as Babylon turned against her to ensure her total devastation in 587 B.C."
NABRE,25,4,21,"[7] Rejoice: the address is sarcastic, since Edom (where Uz may have been located) ravaged the land after the fall of Jerusalem (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/137/1'>PS 137</a>)."
NABRE,25,5,6,"[1] Extended a hand: that is, made an alliance. In its state of abjection, Judah was forced to depend on the major powers to the west and the east for subsistence."
NABRE,25,5,8,"[2] Servants: the Hebrew word for ""servant"" is also the word used for an official of relatively high status (servant of the ruler; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/25/24'>2KG 25:24</a>, where the term is used to refer to Babylonian rulers over occupied Jerusalem); the author doubtless intends the double meaning here."
NABRE,25,5,14,"[3] The gate: a place of assembly, where city decisions were made and judgment given by the elders and other community leaders; see note on <a href='/NABRE/8/4/1'>RUT 4:1</a>."
NABRE,25,5,20,"[4] 5:20-22 Unlike most of the laments found in the Book of Psalms, the Book of Lamentations never moves from lament to thanksgiving. It ends with this question still unanswered by God: ""Why have you utterly forgotten us?"""
NABRE,73,1,2,"[1] In the fifth year, on the seventh day of the month: Jerusalem fell on the seventh day of the fifth month in 587 B.C.; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/25/8'>2KG 25:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/52/12'>JER 52:12</a>. Either the text read originally ""the fifth month,"" or it refers to the observance of an anniversary of the fall of Jerusalem."
NABRE,73,1,4,"[2] The river Sud: probably one of the Babylonian canals, not otherwise identified; or possibly a misreading of Ahava; cf. <a href='/NABRE/15/8/21'>EZR 8:21, 31</a>."
NABRE,73,1,8,"[3] 1:8-9 He: apparently Baruch; less likely Jehoiakim the priest (v. <a href='/NABRE/73/1/7'>7</a>). The silver vessels here described are distinct from the vessels referred to in <a href='/NABRE/12/25/14'>2KG 25:14</a> and <a href='/NABRE/15/1/7'>EZR 1:7-9</a>. The author of this note may have thought of the fifth year (v. <a href='/NABRE/73/1/1'>1</a>) of Zedekiah, in view of <a href='/NABRE/24/28/1'>JER 28:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/29/1'>29:1-3</a>. A ""fifth year,"" again with no month mentioned, is given in <a href='/NABRE/26/1/2'>EZE 1:2</a> for the inaugural vision of Ezekiels prophetic career."
NABRE,73,1,10,"[4] Offer these: since <a href='/NABRE/73/2/26'>2:26</a> suggests that the Temple is destroyed, the mention of sacrifices here may be an anachronism. Nevertheless, <a href='/NABRE/24/41/5'>JER 41:5</a> indicates that some people continued to worship at the Temple site after Nebuchadnezzars destruction of the Temple."
NABRE,73,1,11,"[5] Nebuchadnezzar…Belshazzar, his son: Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon, not of Nebuchadnezzar, the destroyer of Jerusalem. Belshazzar was co-regent for a few years while his father was away in Arabia. Later Jewish tradition seems to have simplified the end of the Babylonian empire (cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/5/1'>DAN 5:1-2</a>), for three kings came between Nebuchadnezzar and Nabonidus."
NABRE,73,1,15,"[6] 1:15-2:10 This confession of sin is similar to <a href='/NABRE/27/9/7'>DAN 9:7-14</a>, and echoes ideas from Deuteronomy and Jeremiah; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/16/9/1'>NEH 9</a>."

NABRE,73,2,15,"[4] Israel: the Israelites claimed descent from the patriarch Jacob, who had received the name Israel in a mysterious encounter with God (<a href='/NABRE/1/32/29'>GEN 32:29</a>). Thus the Deity was sometimes referred to as ""the God of Israel"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/33/20'>GEN 33:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/5/1'>EXO 5:1</a>)."

NABRE,73,2,28,"[9] 2:28-35 These words do not actually quote anything Moses is recorded as having said, but they present the substance of a passage such as <a href='/NABRE/5/30/1'>DEU 30:1-10</a>, which envisions exile, repentance, and restoration."
NABRE,73,3,9,"[1] 3:9-4:4 This poem in praise of personified Wisdom utilizes the theme of <a href='/NABRE/18/28/1'>JOB 28</a> (where is wisdom to be found?) and it identifies wisdom and law, as in <a href='/NABRE/71/24/22'>SIR 24:22-23</a>."

NABRE,73,4,5,"[2] 4:5-5:9 The poet addresses the exiles (vv. <a href='/NABRE/73/4/5'>5-9</a>a), and then Zion personified is introduced, speaking to the nations and mourning the loss of her children (vv. <a href='/NABRE/73/4/9'>9b</a>-16). She then addresses the exiles (vv. <a href='/NABRE/73/4/17'>17-29</a>). Finally (<a href='/NABRE/73/4/30'>4:30</a>-<a href='/NABRE/73/5/9'>5:9</a>) the poet issues three calls to Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/73/4/30'>4:30, 36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/73/5/5'>5:5</a>): she will see her children returning (<a href='/NABRE/73/4/22'>4:22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/4/36'>36-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/73/5/5'>5:5</a>)."

NABRE,73,4,35,[4] Deserts and desolate places were looked upon as the habitation of demons; cf. <a href='/NABRE/68/8/3'>TOB 8:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/11/24'>LUK 11:24</a>.
NABRE,73,6,2,"[1] Seven generations: this number may be symbolic. If it is not, it may indicate the date of this composition by an author writing for his contemporaries for whom the conditions of the exile were still realities. He has multiplied the seventy years of <a href='/NABRE/24/29/10'>JER 29:10</a> by three or four."
NABRE,73,6,4,"[2] 6:4-72 This whole chapter is a sustained argument against the temptation to worship Babylonian gods. A pattern is repeated throughout the chapter: various reasons are set forth to prove that the idols in the Babylonian temples are not gods (e.g., they are weak, helpless, attended by unworthy ministers); each section is followed by an exhortation not to be deceived, not to worship them. Note the refrain at vv. <a href='/NABRE/73/6/14'>14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/22'>22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/28'>28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/39'>39</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/44'>44</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/51'>51</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/56'>56</a>, <a href='/NABRE/73/6/64'>64</a>. Israelite religion was aniconic, i.e., it prohibited images; as elsewhere in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/23/42/17'>ISA 42:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/44/9'>44:9-20</a>), the polemic against idols here oversimplifies by identifying the god worshiped with the image that represents it."
NABRE,73,6,6,"[3] My angel: the prophet assures the people that Gods watchful care is with them, just as he was with their ancestors during their journey to the promised land (<a href='/NABRE/2/23/20'>EXO 23:20</a>)."

NABRE,73,6,27,"[5] 6:27-31 From the viewpoint of Jewish ritual law, the practices named here were grotesque and depraved; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/12/2'>LEV 12:2-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/15/19'>15:19-23</a>."
NABRE,73,6,33,"[6] 6:33-39 All that the Babylonian gods cannot do, the true God does; they have neither power nor inclination to save those in need, unlike the God of Israel, who champions the cause of the weak over the strong, and who defends the widow and the orphan. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/2/7'>1SM 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/68/6'>PS 68:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/146/7'>146:7-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/35/4'>ISA 35:4-5</a>."

NABRE,73,6,52,"[9] 6:52-53 Unlike the God of Israel, the Babylonian gods are unable to set up and depose kings, or to provide life-giving rain."
NABRE,73,6,59,"[10] 6:59-62 The elements of nature, obedient to Gods orders and accomplishing the divine purpose, are better than the Babylonian gods."
NABRE,26,1,1,"[1] The thirtieth year,which corresponds to the fifth year of exile (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/1/2'>2</a>), has never been satisfactorily explained; possibly it refers to the prophets age, or the anniversary of the finding of the book of the law in the Temple during Josiahs reform of 622 (<a href='/NABRE/12/22/1'>2KG 22:1-13</a>). The river Chebar: probably a canal near Nippur, southeast of Babylon, one of the sites on which the Jewish exiles were settled."
NABRE,26,1,2,"[2] The fifth day…the fifth year: the end of July, 593 B.C.; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/26/1/1'>1</a>."
NABRE,26,1,4,"[3] The North: Zaphon, the traditional abode of the gods; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/18/37/22'>JOB 37:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/48/3'>PS 48:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/14/13'>ISA 14:13-15</a>."
NABRE,26,1,5,"[4] Four living creatures: identified as cherubim in <a href='/NABRE/26/10/1'>10:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/26/10/20'>20</a>. Known from Assyrian religion as minor guardian deities of palaces and temples, the cherubim were usually portrayed in gigantic sculpture with the bodies of bulls or lions, wings like an eagle and a human head. In the Jerusalem Temple, the Lord was enthroned above in the holy of holies (<a href='/NABRE/23/6/1'>ISA 6:1-2</a>)."
NABRE,26,1,10,"[5] The four faces together represent animate creation: wild animals, domesticated livestock, birds, and human beings. Christian tradition associates them with the four evangelists: the lion with Mark, the ox with Luke, the eagle with John, and the man with Matthew."
NABRE,26,1,13,[6] 1:13-14 The coals and flashing lightning moving among the four creatures and yet coming from them identify this vision as a theophany. See note on <a href='/NABRE/26/10/2'>10:2-13</a>.
NABRE,26,1,15,[7] 1:15-21 The repetitions and inconsistencies in the description of the wheels and the direction of their movements evoke the visions mysterious quality and emphasize the difficulty of describing the divine world in human language.
NABRE,26,1,22,"[8] 1:22-23, 26 This symbolic description of Gods throne is similar to that in <a href='/NABRE/2/24/9'>EXO 24:9-10</a>."
NABRE,26,1,26,[9] Looked like a human being: the God who transcends the powers of the human imagination is pictured here in the likeness of an enthroned human king.
NABRE,26,2,1,"[1] Son of man: in Hebrew, ""son/daughter of…"" is a common idiom expressing affiliation in a group; in this case, ""a human being."" The title is Gods habitual way of addressing the prophet throughout this book, probably used to emphasize the separation of the divine and the human."
NABRE,26,2,2,"[2] The spirit: lit., wind, breath; a vital power, coming from God, which enables the prophet to hear the divine word; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/8/3'>8:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/11/1'>11:1, 24</a>."
NABRE,26,2,6,[3] And you sit among scorpions: the prophet must be prepared for bitter opposition.
NABRE,26,3,3,"[1] As sweet as honey: though the prophet must foretell terrible things, the word of God is sweet to the one who receives it."
NABRE,26,3,8,[2] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/1/18'>JER 1:18</a>. The prophet must face fierce opposition with the determination and resistance shown by his opponents.
NABRE,26,3,12,"[3] The glory of the Lord: the divine presence, manifested here in audible form. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/40/34'>EXO 40:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/2/9'>LUK 2:9</a>."
NABRE,26,3,15,"[4] Tel-abib: one of the sites where the exiles were settled, probably near Nippur."
NABRE,26,3,16,"[5] 3:17-21 This passage refers to the prophets role as sentinel, placed here and in chap. <a href='/NABRE/26/33/1'>33</a> as introductions to sections containing judgment oracles and salvation oracles respectively; cf. <a href='/NABRE/35/2/1'>HAB 2:1</a>."
NABRE,26,3,26,[6] 3:26-27 Mute: here the prophets inability to speak to the people in exile while Jerusalem was being besieged is seen as a consequence of Gods direct intervention (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/24/27'>24:27</a>).
NABRE,26,4,1,[1] 4:1-5:4 The symbolic actions in this section prepare for the series of oracles that follow in <a href='/NABRE/26/5/5'>5:5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/26/7/27'>7:27</a>.
NABRE,26,4,5,"[2] 4:5-6 Three hundred and ninety days…forty days: a symbol to represent the respective lengths of exile for the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Southern Kingdom of Judah. Israel had already fallen to Assyria in 722/721 B.C. The numerical value of the Hebrew consonants in the phrase translated ""the days of your siege"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/4/8'>8</a>) is three hundred and ninety. Forty years conventionally represents one generation."
NABRE,26,4,7,[3] Bared arm: a symbol of unrestrained power.
NABRE,26,4,9,"[4] 4:9-13 This action represents the scarcity of food during the siege of Jerusalem, and the consequent need to eat whatever is at hand. Twenty shekels: about nine ounces. The sixth of a hin: about one quart."
NABRE,26,4,11,[5] Hin: see note on <a href='/NABRE/26/45/24'>45:24</a>.
NABRE,26,4,16,[6] Break the staff of bread: reducing the supply of bread that supports life as the walking staff supports a traveler; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/5/16'>5:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/14/13'>14:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/26/26'>LEV 26:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/105/16'>PS 105:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/3/1'>ISA 3:1</a>.
NABRE,26,5,2,[1] The city: the one drawn on the tablet (<a href='/NABRE/26/4/1'>4:1</a>).
NABRE,26,5,8,"[2] I am coming against you: an expression borrowed from the language of warfare in which an enemy attacked another with the sword. ""You"" in vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/5/8'>8-17</a> is Jerusalem."
NABRE,26,5,10,[3] Parents will eat their children…parents: the prophet describes the consequences of the prolonged Babylonian siege of Jerusalem in 587/586 B.C. See note on <a href='/NABRE/25/2/20'>LAM 2:20</a>.
NABRE,26,6,3,[1] High places: raised platforms usually built on hills outside towns for making sacrifices to the Lord or to Canaanite deities. They became synonymous with places of idolatry after the centralization of worship in the Jerusalem Temple.
NABRE,26,6,5,[2] Scatter your bones…altars: the bones of the dead defiled a place; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/23/14'>2KG 23:14</a>.
NABRE,26,6,7,"[3] You shall know that I am the Lord: this formula is repeated after most of Ezekiels oracles from this point on. Whatever happens to Israel happens at the Lords command; because the Lord uses the nations to punish or reward Israel for its behavior, Israel will learn that its God has sole rule over the nations and the universe, and will acknowledge that rule in obedience."
NABRE,26,6,11,"[4] Clap your hands, stamp your feet: these gestures may express grief, even horror, at Israels infidelities; in <a href='/NABRE/26/25/6'>25:6</a>, they are signs of gloating."
NABRE,26,6,13,"[5] Every green tree and leafy oak: trees often identified with fertility deities and the ""tree of life""; sacred groves had a long history in Palestine and throughout the Mediterranean basin as places of worship; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/12/2'>DEU 12:2</a>."
NABRE,26,6,14,"[6] From the wilderness to Riblah: the whole land, from the far south to the far north."
NABRE,26,7,12,[1] 7:12-13 Normal affairs will cease to have any meaning in view of the disaster that is to come.
NABRE,26,7,17,[2] Hands…knees: image of profound terror; loss of control of body movement and functions.
NABRE,26,7,18,[3] Shaved bald: shaving the head was a sign of mourning.
NABRE,26,7,20,[4] Assyrian wall paintings show that statues of deities were often cast in precious metals and then decorated with jewelry. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/40/19'>ISA 40:19-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/41/6'>41:6-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/44/9'>44:9-20</a>.
NABRE,26,7,24,[5] Proud strength: misplaced trust in the might and power of their kings and army. Cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/26/7/22'>22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/33/28'>33:28</a> and related ideas in <a href='/NABRE/23/2/12'>ISA 2:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/10/12'>10:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/13/11'>13:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/48/29'>JER 48:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/24/21'>EZE 24:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/30/18'>30:18</a>.
NABRE,26,8,1,"[1] In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month: September, 592 B.C."
NABRE,26,8,2,[2] Looked like a man: the divine presence which accompanies Ezekiel in these visions. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/40/3'>40:3-4</a>.
NABRE,26,8,3,"[3] The spirit lifted me up: the prophet is transported in vision from Babylon to Jerusalem. Ezekiel may be drawing on his memory of the Temple from before his exile in 598 B.C. The statue of jealousy: the statue which provokes the Lords outrage against the insults of his own people; perhaps the statue of the goddess Asherah set up by Manasseh, king of Judah (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/21/7'>2KG 21:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/33/7'>2CH 33:7, 15</a>). Although his successor, Josiah, had removed it (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/6'>2KG 23:6</a>), the statue may have been set up again after his death."
NABRE,26,8,10,"[4] Creeping things and loathsome beasts: perhaps images of Egyptian deities, often represented in animal form. During the last days of Jerusalem Zedekiah, king of Judah, was allied with Egypt, hoping for protection against the Babylonians."
NABRE,26,8,14,"[5] Wept for Tammuz: the withering of trees and plants that began in late spring was attributed to the descent of Tammuz, the Mesopotamian god of fertility, to the world of the dead beneath the earth. During the fourth month of the year, female worshipers of Tammuz would wail and mourn the gods disappearance."
NABRE,26,8,16,"[6] Bowing eastward: sun worship was perhaps introduced as a condition of alliance with other nations. While Josiah removed some elements of this worship (<a href='/NABRE/12/23/11'>2KG 23:11</a>), Manasseh, for example, built altars to all the ""hosts of heaven"" in two Temple courtyards (<a href='/NABRE/12/21/5'>2KG 21:5</a>)."
NABRE,26,8,17,"[7] Putting the branch to my nose: the meaning is uncertain. It may be connected with the social injustice mentioned in v. <a href='/NABRE/26/8/17'>17b</a> and in <a href='/NABRE/26/9/9'>9:9</a>, e.g., ""with their violence they tweak my nose,"" i.e., ""goad my fury."" The Masoretic text reads ""their noses"" as a euphemism for ""my nose,"" thus avoiding the impropriety of these idolaters coming into contact with God even figuratively."
NABRE,26,9,4,"[1] Ezekiel emphasizes personal accountability; the innocent inhabitants of Jerusalem are spared while the idolatrous are punished. An X: lit., the Hebrew letter taw."
NABRE,26,10,2,"[1] 10:2-13 The burning coals, a sign of the divine presence (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/28/14'>28:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/18/9'>PS 18:9</a>), represent the judgment of destruction that God is visiting upon the city; they may also represent the judgment of purification that prepares the land to become the Lords sanctuary (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/6/6'>ISA 6:6-7</a>)."
NABRE,26,10,15,"[2] 10:15-19 The throne represents Gods presence as ruler and protector of the land. In chap. <a href='/NABRE/26/1/1'>1</a>, God is revealed as the lord of the world who can appear even in a far-off land; here God is about to abandon the Temple, that is, hand the city over to its enemies. God and the throne return again in <a href='/NABRE/26/43/1'>43:1-3</a>."
NABRE,26,10,20,"[3] 10:20-22 The repetition of description from the preceding verses is a device intended to suggest the rapid, constantly changing motion of the vision and the difficulty of describing the divine in human language."
NABRE,26,11,3,[1] No need to build houses…meat: this advice is based on the conviction that invincible Jerusalem will protect its citizens from further danger just as a pot shields the meat inside from the fire. The poorer citizens of Jerusalem and the refugees from nearby villages can now appropriate the property abandoned by the citys wealthier upper class when they were deported (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/11/15'>15</a>). The metaphor of the pot and its contents reappears in chap. <a href='/NABRE/26/24/1'>24</a>.
NABRE,26,11,13,"[2] In Ezekiels vision Pelatiah represents the people left in Jerusalem, ""the remnant of Israel."" His sudden death in the vision, but not in reality, is a figure for the judgment described in vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/11/8'>8-10</a> and prompts Ezekiels anguished question about the survival of the people left in the land after the deportations in 597."
NABRE,26,11,15,"[3] 11:15-21 Ezekiel insists that those who remained in Judah are doomed; the exiles, under a new covenant, will constitute a new Israel. Cf. chap. <a href='/NABRE/26/36/1'>36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/24/7'>JER 24:7</a>; 29."
NABRE,26,11,23,"[4] The glory of the Lord departs toward the east, to the exiles in Babylon; it will return once the Temple is rebuilt (<a href='/NABRE/26/43/1'>43:1-3</a>)."
NABRE,26,12,3,"[1] 12:3-10 An exiles bag contains bare necessities, probably no more than a bowl, a mat, and a waterskin. The prophets action foreshadows the fate of ruler and people (vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/12/11'>11-14</a>)."
NABRE,26,12,5,"[2] Through the wall: mud-brick outer wall of a private home. In this symbolic action, Ezekiel represents the enemy forces, and the house wall, the city wall of Jerusalem breached by the Babylonian army."
NABRE,26,12,13,"[3] Though he shall not see it: according to a Targum, an allusion to Nebuchadnezzar having Zedekiah blinded before deporting him to Babylonia (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/25/7'>2KG 25:7</a>); according to the Septuagint, the king is ashamed of his flight from the city and disguises himself so others will not recognize him."
NABRE,26,12,16,"[4] Both exiles and nations shall know that the exile is divine punishment for Israels betrayal of the Lord and the covenant, not evidence that the Lord is too weak to fight off the Babylonian deity."
NABRE,26,12,19,"[5] The people of the land: the exiles in Babylon who, ironically, are now outside the land."
NABRE,26,12,22,[6] 12:22-28 This proverb conveys the skepticism the people of Jerusalem have; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/20/7'>JER 20:7-9</a>.
NABRE,26,13,10,"[1] The false prophets contributed to popular illusions of security by predictions of peace, like those who whitewash a wall to conceal its defects."
NABRE,26,13,18,"[2] Sew amulets…make veils: used by sorcerers to mark individuals for life or for death. For a small price (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/13/19'>19</a>), these women promised protection for the wicked, who, in the Lords estimation, ""should not live"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/13/19'>19</a>), and death for the righteous, ""who should not be slain"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/13/19'>19</a>). Both decisions belong to the Lord."
NABRE,26,13,19,[3] Handfuls of barley and crumbs of bread: payment for the amulets and scarves.
NABRE,26,14,9,[1] The ancient Israelites thought that God could use deception as a means of promoting divine justice; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/24/1'>2SM 24:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/19'>1KG 22:19-23</a>.
NABRE,26,14,11,"[2] 14:12-23 According to Ezekiel, the people in Jerusalem deserve destruction because they are corrupt. Yet he admits an exception to the principle of individual responsibility when he affirms that some of those deserving death will survive and be reunited with family in exile. The depravity of Jerusalem testifies that the punishment of Jerusalem was just and necessary."
NABRE,26,14,14,"[3] Noah, Daniel, and Job: righteous folk heroes whom Israel shared with other ancient Near Eastern cultures. Daniel was the just judge celebrated in Ugaritic literature, perhaps the model for the hero of <a href='/NABRE/27/13/1'>DAN 13</a>."
NABRE,26,15,1,"[1] 15:1-8 Verses 2-5 point out that the wood of the vinestock may be burned for fuel, fit only for destruction. In vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/15/6'>6-8</a> Ezekiel asserts that Jerusalem has the same destiny."
NABRE,26,16,3,[1] 16:3-4 By origin and birth…Hittite: Jerusalems pre-Israelite origins are the breeding ground for its inability to respond faithfully to the Lords generosity.
NABRE,26,16,4,"[2] 16:4-5 In this chapter, Ezekiel represents Jerusalem and Samaria as unwanted, abandoned sisters whom the Lord rescues and cares for. Here the prophet depicts Jerusalem as a newborn female, abandoned and left to die, an accepted practice in antiquity for females, who were considered financial liabilities by their families. That the infant has no one, not even her mother, to tie off her umbilical cord, wash her clean, and wrap her in swaddling clothes emphasizes Jerusalems death-like isolation and accentuates the Lords gracious action in her behalf. The practice of rubbing the skin of newborns with salt is an attested Palestinian custom that survived into the twentieth century."
NABRE,26,16,8,"[3] I spread the corner of my cloak: one way to acquire a woman for marriage; cf. <a href='/NABRE/8/3/9'>RUT 3:9</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/5/23/1'>DEU 23:1</a> a sons illicit sexual relations with his fathers wife is described as ""uncovering the edge of the fathers garment."""
NABRE,26,16,16,[4] In the allegory of this chapter the viewpoint often shifts from the figure (prostitution) to the reality (idolatry). A symbol of the womans depravity supersedes her parents cruel abandonment when she was an infant. It overrides the loyalty she owes her covenant partner and the care she owes their children.
NABRE,26,16,20,[5] 16:20-21 Also a reference to the practice of child sacrifice introduced under Judahs impious kings; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/16/3'>2KG 16:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/17/17'>17:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>JER 7:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/19/5'>19:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/32/35'>32:35</a>.
NABRE,26,16,24,[6] A platform…a dais: associated with rituals borrowed from the Canaanites.
NABRE,26,16,27,"[7] Philistines: lit., ""daughters of the Philistines,"" a common expression when referring to the various towns that make up a territory."
NABRE,26,16,38,"[8] As a jealous husband, Yhwh severely punishes Jerusalem for her adultery: i.e., her worship of idols. Adultery was considered a capital crime in ancient Israel; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/20/10'>LEV 20:10-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/5/11'>NUM 5:11-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/22/22'>DEU 22:22</a>."
NABRE,26,16,45,[9] Truly the daughter of your mother: Jerusalems depraved behavior follows from the bad behavior of its non-Israelite forebears; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/26/16/3'>3</a>.
NABRE,26,16,46,"[10] 16:46-47 Jerusalem is so much more corrupt than Samaria, the elder sister in size, and the smaller Sodom that both now appear just and righteous. Ezekiels reference to Sodom indicates that the citys identification with wickedness and evil was already an established tradition in fifth century B.C. Judah."
NABRE,26,16,60,[11] Everlasting covenant: Ezekiel foresees God renewing the covenant of Sinai in a new and spirit-empowered way that will not be fatally broken as in the present exile or force God to abandon Israel again; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/11/19'>11:19-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/36/25'>36:25-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/37/26'>37:26-28</a>.
NABRE,26,17,11,"[1] 17:11-21 These verses explain the allegory in vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/17/3'>3-10</a>. In 597 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar removed Jehoiachin from the throne and took him into exile; in his place he set Zedekiah, Jehoiachins uncle, on the throne and received from him the oath of loyalty. But Zedekiah was persuaded to rebel by Pharaoh Hophra of Egypt and thus deserved punishment; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/24/10'>2KG 24:10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/25/7'>25:7</a>."
NABRE,26,17,22,[2] 17:22-23 The Lord will undo the actions of the Babylonian king by rebuilding the Davidic dynasty so the nations realize that only Israels God can restore a peoples destiny.
NABRE,26,18,2,[1] Parents…on edge: a proverb the people quoted to complain that they were being punished for their ancestors sins; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/31/29'>JER 31:29</a>.
NABRE,26,18,6,[2] Eat on the mountains: take part in meals after sacrifice at the high places.
NABRE,26,18,25,[3] The Lords way is not fair: this chapter rejects the idea that punishment is transferred from one generation to the next and emphasizes individual responsibility and accountability.
NABRE,26,19,1,"[1] 19:1-9 Some commentators identify Jehoahaz and Zedekiah, sons of the same mother, as the ""two young lions""; they were deported to Egypt and Babylon respectively. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/23/31'>2KG 23:31-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/24/18'>24:18-20</a>."
NABRE,26,19,4,"[2] A common fate for royal prisoners: e.g., Assurbanipal claims he put a ring in the jaw of a captive king and a dog collar around his neck (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/26/19/9'>9</a>). A wall relief shows Esarhaddon holding two royal captives with ropes tied to rings in their lips."
NABRE,26,19,10,"[3] 19:10-14 Vine: Judah. One strong branch: the Davidic king. This allegory describes the deportation of the Davidic dynasty to Babylon and laments the destruction of the house of David. From Ezekiels perspective, the arrogance of Judahs kings leads to this tragedy (vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/19/12'>12-14</a>)."
NABRE,26,20,1,"[1] The seventh year…the fifth month: August 14, 591 B.C."
NABRE,26,20,7,"[2] Detestable things: in the Book of Ezekiel, Israels continued worship of idols in Egypt and in the wilderness, despite the Lords powerful deeds on their behalf, is the reason God punishes them so severely; they must learn and acknowledge that he is their only Lord. Cf., e.g., Exodus (<a href='/NABRE/26/5/1'>5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/26/6/9'>6:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/14/10'>14:10-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/16/1'>16:1-36</a>) and Numbers (<a href='/NABRE/26/11/1'>11:1-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/14/1'>14:1-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/20/1'>20:1-9</a>), where the peoples failure to trust Moses and the Lord brings punishment."
NABRE,26,20,25,"[3] 20:25-26 I gave them statutes that were not good: because Israel rejected the Lords life-giving laws, he ""gave"" laws (e.g., the sacrifice of every firstborn) that would lead only to death and destruction. <a href='/NABRE/5/12/29'>DEU 12:29-31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>JER 7:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/19/4'>19:4-5</a> may address a popular assumption that the Lord accepted and perhaps required child sacrifice, especially as evidence of great trust during national emergencies (<a href='/NABRE/12/3/27'>2KG 3:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/6/7'>MIC 6:7</a>). By combining language from <a href='/NABRE/2/22/28'>EXO 22:28</a> with the vocabulary of child sacrifice, Ezekiel suggests that firstborn sons were regularly sacrificed in Israel."
NABRE,26,20,29,"[4] High place: a cultic site, originally a hilltop, but often a raised platform in a sacred area. Until Deuteronomys insistence that official and legitimate worship of the Lord take place only in Jerusalem, these local shrines were popular places for worship (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/9/9/1'>1SM 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/9/10/1'>10</a>) or for consulting the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/11/3/4'>1KG 3:4-5</a>). In order to unite the Kingdom of Judah politically and religiously, <a href='/NABRE/5/12/2'>DEU 12:2</a> demands destruction of the high places.

Nile: the many rivulets of the Nile that branch out into the Delta."
NABRE,26,29,4,"[4] 29:4-5 Ezekiels repetition of detail creates a vivid picture of Egypts destruction: God hauls the crocodile (Pharaoh) and the fish clinging to it for protection (the Egyptian populace) out of the Nile and lands them in an open field, where their corpses are torn apart by wildlife rather than being properly buried (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/28/26'>DEU 28:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/9/36'>2KG 9:36-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/34/20'>JER 34:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/39/17'>EZE 39:17-20</a>)."

Some manuscripts read ""eleventh"" for ""twelfth"" year (January, 586); even so, there was ample time between the fall of Jerusalem and the arrival of the survivor from that city to journey to Babylon. However, this is the survivor sent to fulfill the promise of <a href='/NABRE/26/24/25'>EZE 24:25-27</a>, the eyewitness whose arrival would release Ezekiel from his muteness; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/3/26'>3:26-27</a>."
NABRE,26,33,22,"[3] 33:23-29 News brought by the survivor furnished the occasion for this prophecy. Like Jeremiah, Ezekiel rejects the idea that those left in Judah have any claim to the land. The new Israel is to be formed from the exiles."

NABRE,26,34,2,"[1] Shepherds: the leaders of the people. A frequent title for kings and deities in the ancient Near East; the ideal ruler took care of his subjects and anticipated their needs. Ezekiels oracle broadens the reference to include the whole class of Jerusalems leaders (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/34/17'>17</a>). The prophet assures his audience, the exiles in Babylon, that God holds these leaders responsible for what has happened to Jerusalem and will give Israel a new shepherd worthy of the title."

NABRE,26,35,5,[2] Final punishment: throughout this oracle the prophet echoes the threat against the mountains of Israel found in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/26/6/1'>6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/26/7/1'>7</a>.
NABRE,26,35,10,"[3] The two nations and the two lands: by presenting Edoms excursion into the southern territory of Judah as its claim to both kingdoms, Ezekiel exaggerates Edoms greed and arrogance.

NABRE,26,36,20,"[2] 36:20-24 These verses make clear that Israels restoration is Gods initiative, independent of the peoples shame and repentance (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/36/31'>31</a>). By their wickedness, Israel provoked the exile; its presence among the nations gave the impression that God could not protect his people. Gods gracious return of Israel to its land will restore his honor among these same nations."
NABRE,26,36,25,"[3] 36:25-26 Gods initiative to cleanse Israel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/24/13'>24:13-14</a>) is the first act in the creation of a new people, no longer disposed to repeating Israels wicked past (chap. <a href='/NABRE/26/20/1'>20</a>). To make this restoration permanent, God replaces Israels rebellious and obdurate interiority (""heart of stone"") with an interiority (""heart of flesh"") susceptible to and animated by Gods intentions (""my spirit,"" v. <a href='/NABRE/26/36/27'>27</a>)."
NABRE,26,37,1,"[1] 37:1-14 This account is a figurative description of Gods creation of a new Israel. Even though that creation begins with the remains of the old Israel, the exiles under the image of dry bones, depicting a totally hopeless situation, the new Israel is radically different: it is an ideal people, shaped by Gods spirit to live the covenant faithfully, something the old Israel, exiles included, were unable to do. While this passage in its present context is not about the doctrine of individual or communal resurrection, many Jewish and Christian commentators suggest that the doctrine is foreshadowed here."
NABRE,26,37,9,"[2] The Hebrew word rûahhas multiple related meanings expressed by different English words: wind, spirit, breath.

NABRE,26,38,1,"[1] 38:1-39:20 These three oracles against Gog (<a href='/NABRE/26/38/2'>38:2-13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/26/38/14'>14-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/39/1'>39:1-20</a>) describe a mythic attack of God against a final enemy of his people sometime in the future. Like the oracles against the nations, their purpose is to strengthen Israels hope in God, since they end with Gods triumph on behalf of the people."
NABRE,26,38,2,"[2] Gog: the name is symbolic, probably derived from Gyges, king of Lydia. The gloss Magog may be an Akkadian expression, mat-Gog, ""the land of Gog."" Meshech and Tubal, as well as Gomer and Beth-togarmah (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/38/6'>6</a>), were countries around the Black Sea, the northernmost countries known to the Israelites. The north was the traditional direction from which invasion was expected; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/1/13'>JER 1:13-15</a>."
NABRE,26,38,12,"[3] Center: lit., ""navel."" Many ancient peoples spoke of their own homelands as ""the navel,"" that is, the center of the earth."
NABRE,26,38,15,[4] Zaphon: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/18/37/22'>JOB 37:22</a>.
NABRE,26,39,11,"[1] The Valley of Abarim: in the Abarim mountains, east of the Jordan. ""Abarim"" plays on the word oberim, ""travelers."" Hamon-Gog: ""the horde of Gog."""
NABRE,26,40,1,"[1] 40:1-48:35 This lengthy vision of a new Temple and a restored Israel is dated in v. <a href='/NABRE/26/40/1'>1</a> to April 28, 573 B.C. The literary form of the vision is sometimes compared to a mandala, a sacred model through which one can move symbolically to reach the world of the divine. Ezekiel describes the Temple through its boundaries, entrances, and exits in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/26/40/1'>40</a>-<a href='/NABRE/26/43/1'>43</a>; by its sacred and profane use and space in 44-46; and by its central place within the land itself in 47-48. The prophet could not have expected a literal fulfillment of much of what he described. The passage doubtless went through several editorial stages, both from the prophet and from later writers."
NABRE,26,40,5,"[2] A cubit plus a handbreadth: a great cubit. The ordinary cubit consisted of six handbreadths; the great cubit, of seven. In measuring the Temple, a rod six great cubits long was used. The ordinary cubit was about one and a half feet, or, more exactly, 17.5 inches; the large cubit, 20.4 inches."
NABRE,26,40,5,"[3] 40:6-16 The gate facing east, leading into the outer court of the Temple, is described more fully than the north and south gates, which, however, have the same dimensions. On the west side of the outer court there is a large building instead of a gate (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/41/12'>41:12</a>)."
NABRE,26,40,17,"[4] The outer court: the court outside the Temple area proper, which had its own inner court (vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/40/28'>28-37</a>)."
NABRE,26,40,27,"[5] 40:28-37 The gates leading into the inner court of the Temple area correspond to the gates leading into the outer court, with the exception that their vestibules are on the outer rather than the inner side."
NABRE,26,40,30,"[6] The reference to vestibules all around is uncertain, and the verse may have arisen as a partial repetition of v. <a href='/NABRE/26/40/29'>29</a>."
NABRE,26,40,46,[7] Sons of Zadok: descendants of the priestly line of Zadok; cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/15/24'>2SM 15:24-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/1/32'>1KG 1:32-34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/2/35'>2:35</a>.
NABRE,26,40,47,"[8] 40:48-41:15 The description of Ezekiels visionary Temple closely follows the description of the Temple of Solomon (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/1'>1KG 6</a>), along with some crucial differences."
NABRE,26,41,4,"[1] 40:49-41:4 Vestibule…nave…holy of holies: the three divisions of the Temple building in progressing order of sanctity. The last is called ""the inner sanctuary"" in <a href='/NABRE/11/6/1'>1KG 6</a>."
NABRE,26,41,6,[2] The description of the three stories of rooms surrounding the Temple building can be compared with Solomons Temple in <a href='/NABRE/11/6/6'>1KG 6:6</a>; there a step-like or terraced retaining wall supported the Temple building so no beams or nails from these chambers would enter the Temple wall itself.
NABRE,26,41,12,[3] The building: the function of this structure behind the Temple is never specified.
NABRE,26,41,22,"[4] A wooden altar: the altar of incense, standing in the nave at the entrance to the holy of holies."
NABRE,26,42,5,"[1] 42:5-6 The three rows of identical chambers, on different ground levels, necessarily had roofs on correspondingly different levels."
NABRE,26,42,13,[2] The function of these chambers is explained again in <a href='/NABRE/26/46/19'>46:19-20</a>.
NABRE,26,43,8,"[1] They placed their threshold against my threshold: in preexilic Jerusalem, the Temple and the palace belonged to the same complex of buildings; kings like Ahaz and Manasseh treated it as their private chapel for the religious practices Ezekiel condemns. In the new Israel the Temple is free, even spatially, from civil jurisdiction; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/45/7'>45:7-8</a>. This is an instance of Ezekiels broader program to separate the sacred from the secular."
NABRE,26,43,13,"[2] 43:13-17 The altar: like altars from Assyria and other parts of the ancient Near East, this altar has three parts: a base, a pedestal, and an upper block with a channel cut into the surface on all sides. The rim around the upper block (v. <a href='/NABRE/26/43/17'>17</a>) stopped blood and other sacrificial material from falling to the ground."
NABRE,26,44,3,"[1] Ezekiel imagines a scene like this: The prince stands at the eastern gate of the inner court while his sacrifice is being offered (<a href='/NABRE/26/46/2'>46:2</a>); he then goes to the vestibule of the outer court to eat the sacrificial meal. The closed outer gate on the eastern side signifies that the Lord has entered the Temple permanently, not to depart again."
NABRE,26,44,7,"[2] 44:7-14 According to Ezekiel, the Levites priestly role is reduced to the performance of menial tasks as punishment for their misdeeds (cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/26/44/10'>10-14</a>). This demotion was enforced during the restoration of Temple worship under Ezra and Nehemiah; this may explain the small number of Levites willing to return to Jerusalem after the exile."
NABRE,26,44,19,[3] Transmit holiness to the people: holiness was considered to have a physical quality that could be communicated from person to person. It is a danger to those who have not prepared themselves to be in Gods presence. The priests remove their ceremonial garments out of concern for the people.
NABRE,26,44,29,[4] Under the ban: dedicated to the Lord.
NABRE,26,45,9,"[1] 45:10-12 Besides the land monopoly fostered by royal greed and collusion with the wealthy (<a href='/NABRE/33/2/2'>MIC 2:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/3/12'>ISA 3:12-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/5/8'>5:8-10</a>), one grave social evil of preexilic Israel was dishonesty in business; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/12/8'>HOS 12:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/8/5'>AMO 8:5</a>. Ephah, bath: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>."
NABRE,26,45,12,"[2] Mina: before the exile, a mina was worth fifty shekels; later, in imitation of Babylonian practice, its value increased to sixty shekels. A shekel weighed slightly less than half an ounce. A shekels monetary value depended on whether it was gold or silver."
NABRE,26,45,14,"[3] Kor: a liquid and a dry measure, equal to a homer."
NABRE,26,45,24,[4] Hin: one sixth of the liquid measure known as a bath.
NABRE,26,46,2,"[1] 46:2-12 The prophet describes the inner eastern gateway opening on the inner court of the priests in front of the Temple itself where the altar of sacrifice stands. The people may watch the priests making offerings on sabbaths and feast days only by looking through the open gate; the prince, however, may stand inside the gate, in the vestibule on the edge of the inner court, to observe the offerings. Only priests could stand in the court itself."
NABRE,26,46,17,[2] The year of release: the jubilee year; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/25/23'>LEV 25:23-55</a>.
NABRE,26,46,20,[3] Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/26/44/19'>44:19</a>.
NABRE,26,47,1,[1] 47:1-12 The life and refreshment produced wherever the Temple stream flows evoke the order and abundance of paradise (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/20'>GEN 1:20-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/2/10'>2:10-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/46/5'>PS 46:5</a>) and represent the coming transformation Ezekiel envisions for the exiles and their land. Water signifies great blessings and evidence of the Lords presence (cf. <a href='/NABRE/29/2/14'>JOE 2:14</a>).
NABRE,26,47,8,"[2] The sea: the Dead Sea, in which nothing can live. This vision of the Temple stream which transforms places of death into places of life is similar in purpose to the oracle of dry bones in <a href='/NABRE/26/37/1'>37:1-14</a>: it offers the exiles hope for the future."
NABRE,26,47,10,[3] From En-gedi to En-eglaim: En-gedi is about halfway down the western shore of the Dead Sea; En-eglaim may have been at its northern end.
NABRE,26,47,13,"[4] 47:13-20 These boundaries for a restored Israel correspond to the boundaries of the Davidic kingdom at its fullest extent; they are the ""ideal boundaries"" of the promised land; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/34/3'>NUM 34:3-12</a>."
NABRE,26,48,1,[1] 48:1-29 This distribution of the land among the tribes does not correspond to the geographical realities of Palestine. It is another idealizing element in Ezekiels representation of a restored and transformed Israel.
NABRE,27,1,1,"[1] According to <a href='/NABRE/12/24/1'>2KG 24</a>, the siege of Jerusalem took place after the death of Jehoiakim, but <a href='/NABRE/14/36/5'>2CH 36:5-8</a> says that Jehoiakim was taken to Babylon."
NABRE,27,1,2,"[2] Shinar: ancient name for Babylonia, a deliberate archaism in this text; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/10'>GEN 10:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/2'>11:2</a>."
NABRE,27,1,3,"[3] The proper name Ashpenaz is sometimes taken as a title, major-domo."
NABRE,27,1,7,"[4] Other prominent Jews with Babylonian names include Sheshbazzar and Zerubabbel, who were leaders of the postexilic community."
NABRE,27,1,8,"[5] This defilement: the bread, meat, and wine of the Gentiles were unclean (<a href='/NABRE/28/9/3'>HOS 9:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/1/12'>TOB 1:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/10/5'>JUDI 10:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/69/12/1'>12:1-2</a>) because they might have been offered to idols; and the meat may not have been drained of blood, as Jewish dietary law requires. This test relates to the attempt of Antiochus to force Jews to eat forbidden foods in contempt of their religion (<a href='/NABRE/74/1/62'>1MA 1:62-63</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/6/18'>2MA 6:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/7/1'>7:1</a>)."
NABRE,27,1,21,"[6] The first year of King Cyrus: the year of this Persian kings conquest of Babylon, 539/538 B.C."
NABRE,27,2,1,"[1] 2:1-49 The chronology of v. <a href='/NABRE/27/2/1'>1</a> is in conflict with that of <a href='/NABRE/27/1/5'>1:5, 18</a>, and in <a href='/NABRE/27/2/25'>2:25</a> Daniel appears to be introduced to the king for the first time. It seems that the story of this chapter was originally entirely independent of chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/1/1'>1</a> and later retouched slightly to fit its present setting. The Septuagint (Papyrus 967) reads the twelfth year instead of the second."
NABRE,27,2,2,"[2] Chaldeans: because the Babylonians gave serious study to the stars and planets, ""Chaldeans"" were identified with astrologers throughout the Hellenistic world."
NABRE,27,2,4,"[3] Aramaic: a gloss to indicate that at this point the text switches from Hebrew to Aramaic, which continues through the end of chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/7/1'>7</a>; at <a href='/NABRE/27/8/1'>8:1</a>, the text switches back to Hebrew."
NABRE,27,2,12,"[4] Wise men: the satire, although directed against the Babylonian diviners in the text, refers to the Hellenistic Greeks, who made special claims to wisdom; the assertion here is that true wisdom comes from God and resides with the Jews. Cf. also chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/5/1'>5</a>."
NABRE,27,2,28,"[5] The visions: lit., ""the visions of your head,"" a phrasing which distinguishes visionary experiences that are personal from those that are observable by others (see <a href='/NABRE/27/4/2'>4:2, 7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/4/10'>10</a>). That Daniel, unlike the Chaldeans, has access to these visions testifies to his God-given wisdom. Actually, this ""dream"" is more properly an apocalyptic vision; cf. the very similar message in Daniels vision of chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/7/1'>7</a>."
NABRE,27,2,33,"[6] Clay: it has been suggested that the motif of iron mixed with clay implies a hollow metal statue packed with clay to stabilize it. In the interpretation of the dream, however, the mixture is taken as a sign of weakness."
NABRE,27,2,36,"[7] 2:36-45 The four successive kingdoms in this apocalyptic perspective are the Babylonian (gold), the Median (silver), the Persian (bronze), and the Hellenistic (iron). The last, after Alexanders death, was divided among his generals (vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/2/41'>41-42</a>). Of the kingdoms which emerged from this partitioning, the two that most affected the Jews were the dynasties of the Ptolemies in Egypt and the Seleucids in Syria. They tried in vain, by war and through intermarriage, to restore the unity of Alexanders empire (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/2/43'>43</a>). The stone hewn from the mountain is the kingdom of God awaited by the Jews (vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/2/44'>44-45</a>). Compare the image of the stone applied to Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/42/20/17'>LUK 20:17-18</a>."
NABRE,27,3,1,[1] Dura: several places in Babylonia bore this name. Probably the present reference is to one located close to Babylon. Giant statues of the type mentioned here were not uncommon in antiquity; a cubit was about a foot and a half. The unrealistic proportions of this statue suggest a comic effect.
NABRE,27,3,2,[2] Satraps: Persian provincial governors.
NABRE,27,3,5,[3] The precise identification of the instruments is disputed. Several of the names are Greek.
NABRE,27,3,15,[4] Then all will be well: lacking in Aramaic; this phrase is supplied from the context.
NABRE,27,3,17,"[5] If our God…can save us: the youths do not question the efficacy of the divine power, but whether it will be exercised (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/3/18'>18</a>)."
NABRE,27,3,23,"[6] 3:24-90 These verses are additions to the Aramaic text of Daniel, translated from the Greek form of the book. They were probably first composed in Hebrew or Aramaic, but are no longer extant in the original language. The Roman Catholic Church has always regarded them as part of the canonical Scriptures."
NABRE,27,3,25,"[7] Azariah: i.e., Abednego; cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/1/7'>DAN 1:7</a>."
NABRE,27,3,98,[8] 3:98-4:34 This section has the form of a letter written by Nebuchadnezzar to his subjects.
NABRE,27,4,5,"[1] After the name of my god: Belteshazzar, the Babylonian name given to Daniel at the kings orders (<a href='/NABRE/27/1/7'>1:7</a>), is Balāṭ-šu-uṣur, ""protect his life."" This passage implies a name connected with Bel, a Babylonian god. A spirit of the holy gods: or a holy divine spirit; or spirit of a holy God. See also vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/4/6'>6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/4/15'>15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/5/11'>5:11-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/5/14'>14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/6/4'>6:4</a>."
NABRE,27,4,10,"[2] A holy watcher: lit., ""a watcher and a holy one."" Two terms for angels. The term watcher is found in the Bible only in this chapter of Daniel, but it is common in extra-canonical Jewish literature. In 1 Enoch, the fallen angels are called watchers."
NABRE,27,4,24,"[3] Good deeds: the Aramaic word ṣidqâhas the root meaning of ""righteousness,"" but in a late text such as this could mean ""almsgiving."""
NABRE,27,4,30,"[4] 4:30-32 There is no historical record that these events happened to Nebuchadnezzar. Scholars have long suspected that the story originally involved Nabonidus, the father of Belshazzar, who was absent from Babylon and lived at Teima in the Arabian desert for a number of years. This suggestion is now strengthened by the Prayer of Nabonidus, found at Qumran, which is closely related to chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/4/1'>4</a>. The biblical authors chief interest was not in the historicity of this popular tale, but in the object lesson it contained for the proud ""divine"" kings of the Seleucid dynasty."
NABRE,27,5,2,"[1] Nebuchadnezzar, his father: between Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar several kings ruled in Babylon. Belshazzar was the son of Nabonidus, and he acted as regent in Babylon during his fathers absence."
NABRE,27,5,25,"[2] MENE, TEKEL, and PERES: these seem to be the Aramaic names of weights and monetary values: the mina, the shekel (the sixtieth part of a mina), and the parsu (a half-mina)."
NABRE,27,5,26,"[3] 5:26-28 Daniel interprets these three terms by a play on the words: Mene, connected with the verb meaning to number; Tekel, with the verb meaning to weigh; Peres, with the verb meaning to divide. There is also a play on the last term with the word for Persians."
NABRE,27,6,1,"[1] Darius the Mede: unknown outside of the Book of Daniel. The Median kingdom did not exist at this time because it had already been conquered by Cyrus the Persian. Apparently the author of Daniel is following an apocalyptic view of history, linked to prophecy (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/17'>ISA 13:17-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/51/11'>JER 51:11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/24/51/28'>28-30</a>), according to which the Medes formed the second of four world kingdoms preceding the messianic times; see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/2/36'>DAN 2:36-45</a>. The character of Darius the Mede has probably been modeled on that of the Persian king Darius the Great (522-486 B.C.), the second successor of Cyrus. The Persian Darius did appoint satraps over his empire."
NABRE,27,6,8,"[2] 6:8-11 The Jews of the second century B.C. could relate the kings attempt to force upon them, under pain of death, the worship of a foreign deity to the decrees of Antiochus IV; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/1/41'>1MA 1:41-50</a>."
NABRE,27,6,9,"[3] Immutable and irrevocable: <a href='/NABRE/17/1/19'>EST 1:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/17/8/8'>8:8</a> also refer to the immutability of Medo-Persian laws. The same idea is found in the historian Diodorus Siculus with reference to the time of Darius III (335-331 B.C.), the last of the Persian kings. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/6/13'>DAN 6:13, 16</a>."
NABRE,27,6,17,[4] The lions den: a pit too deep to be easily scaled; its opening was blocked with a stone (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/6/18'>18</a>).
NABRE,27,7,1,"[1] 7:1-27 This vision continues the motif of the four kingdoms from chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/2/1'>2</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/2/36'>2:36-45</a>. To the four succeeding world kingdoms, Babylonian, Median, Persian, and Greek, is opposed the heavenly kingdom of God and the kingdom of Gods people on earth. The beast imagery of this chapter has been used extensively in the Book of Revelation, where it is applied to the Roman empire, the persecutor of the Church."
NABRE,27,7,2,"[2] The great sea: the primordial ocean beneath the earth, according to ancient Near Eastern cosmology (<a href='/NABRE/1/7/11'>GEN 7:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/49/25'>49:25</a>). It was thought to contain various monsters (<a href='/NABRE/23/27/1'>ISA 27:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/7/12'>JOB 7:12</a>), and in particular mythological monsters symbolizing the chaos which God had vanquished in primordial times (<a href='/NABRE/18/9/13'>JOB 9:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/26/12'>26:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>ISA 51:9-10</a>; etc.)."
NABRE,27,7,4,"[3] In ancient times the Babylonian empire was commonly represented as a winged lion, in the rampant position (raised up on one side). The two wings that were plucked may represent Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar. On two feet like a human being…a human mind: contrasts with what is said in <a href='/NABRE/27/4/13'>4:13, 30</a>."
NABRE,27,7,5,"[4] A bear: represents the Median empire, its three tusks symbolizing its destructive nature; hence, the command: ""Arise, devour much flesh."""
NABRE,27,7,6,[5] A leopard: used to symbolize the swiftness with which Cyrus the Persian established his kingdom. Four heads: corresponding to the four Persian kings of <a href='/NABRE/27/11/2'>11:2</a>.
NABRE,27,7,7,"[6] 7:7-8 Alexanders empire was different from all the others in that it was Western rather than Eastern in inspiration, and far exceeded the others in power. The ten horns represent the kings of the Seleucid dynasty, the only part of the Hellenistic empire that concerned the author. The little horn is Antiochus IV Epiphanes (175-164 B.C.), who usurped the throne and persecuted the Jews."
NABRE,27,7,9,"[7] 7:9-10 A vision of the heavenly throne of God (the Ancient of Days), who sits in judgment over the nations. Some of the details of the vision, depicting the divine majesty and omnipotence, are to be found in Ezekiel 1. Others are paralleled in 1 Enoch, a contemporary Jewish apocalypse."
NABRE,27,7,13,"[8] 7:13-14 One like a son of man: In contrast to the worldly kingdoms opposed to God, which are represented as grotesque beasts, the coming Kingdom of God is represented by a human figure. Scholars disagree as to whether this figure should be taken as a collective symbol for the people of God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/7/27'>7:27</a>) or identified as a particular individual, e.g., the archangel Michael (cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/12/1'>12:1</a>) or the messiah. The phrase ""Son of Man"" becomes a title for Jesus in the gospels, especially in passages dealing with the Second Coming (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/1'>MAK 13</a> and parallels)."
NABRE,27,7,18,"[9] ""Holy ones"" in Hebrew and Aramaic literature are nearly always members of the heavenly court or angels (cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/4/10'>4:10, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/4/20'>20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/8/13'>8:13</a>), though here the term is commonly taken to refer to Israel."
NABRE,27,7,25,"[10] The reference is to the persecution of Antiochus IV and specifically to the disruption of the Temple cult (<a href='/NABRE/74/1/41'>1MA 1:41-64</a>). A time, two times, and half a time: an indefinite, evil period of time. Probably here, three and a half years, which becomes the standard period of tribulation in apocalyptic literature (<a href='/NABRE/66/11/2'>REV 11:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/13/5'>13:5</a> [in months]; 11:3 [in days]; and cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/12/14'>12:14</a>). As seven is the Jewish ""perfect"" number, half of it signifies great imperfection. Actually, the Temple was desecrated for three years (<a href='/NABRE/74/4/52'>1MA 4:52-54</a>). The duration of the persecution was a little longer, since it was already under way before the Temple was desecrated."
NABRE,27,7,28,[11] This verse ends the Aramaic part of the Book of Daniel.
NABRE,27,8,1,"[1] 8:1-27 This vision continues images of the preceding one, and develops it in more detail. As explained in vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/8/20'>20-22</a> the two-horned ram represents the combined kingdom of the Medes and Persians, destroyed by Alexanders Hellenistic empire originating in the west. Once again the author is interested only in the Seleucid dynasty, which emerged from the dissolution of Alexanders empire after his death in 323 B.C."
NABRE,27,8,2,"[2] The fortress of Susa: the royal palace of the Persian kings in the ancient territory of Elam, east of Babylonia. The river Ulai: a canal along the northern side of Susa. Some scholars argue that the Hebrew word understood as ""river"" here should instead be translated ""gate."""
NABRE,27,8,9,"[3] A little horn: as in chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/7/1'>7</a>, Antiochus IV. The glorious land: Israel."
NABRE,27,8,10,"[4] 8:10-12 The host of heaven: the angelic host, symbolized by the stars. The Prince of the host: the Most High God, whose worship Antiochus suppressed (<a href='/NABRE/74/1/45'>1MA 1:45</a>)."
NABRE,27,8,13,"[5] The desolating sin: the Hebrew contains a wordplay (shomem) on the name Baal Shamem (""lord of the heavens,"" identified by some as the Greek Zeus Olympios). The reference is to some object with which Antiochus profaned the Temple of Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/75/6/2'>2MA 6:2</a>), most probably a pagan altar."
NABRE,27,8,16,"[6] The angel Gabriel is mentioned here for the first time in the Bible. There is wordplay in the preceding verse on geber, ""manlike figure."""
NABRE,27,8,17,[7] The end time: the time when God sits in judgment on the wicked (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/8/19'>19</a>).
NABRE,27,8,20,"[8] The Medes and Persians: the Medes had been allies of the Babylonians in destroying the Assyrian empire (late seventh century B.C.), and Cyrus the Persian defeated the Medes en route to conquering the Babylonians. The Book of Daniel, however, treats the Medes and Persians as a dual kingdom; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/27/5/28'>5:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/6/9'>6:9</a>; and note on <a href='/NABRE/27/6/1'>6:1</a>."
NABRE,27,9,1,[1] Darius: see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/6/1'>6:1</a>.
NABRE,27,9,2,"[2] Seventy years: Jeremiah was understood to prophesy a Babylonian captivity of seventy years, a round number signifying the complete passing away of the existing generation (<a href='/NABRE/24/25/11'>JER 25:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/29/10'>29:10</a>). On this view Jeremiahs prophecy was seen to be fulfilled in the capture of Babylon by Cyrus and the subsequent return of the Jews to Palestine. However, the author of Daniel, living during the persecution of Antiochus, extends Jeremiahs number to seventy weeks of years (<a href='/NABRE/27/9/24'>DAN 9:24</a>), i.e., seven times seventy years, to encompass the period of Seleucid persecution."
NABRE,27,9,13,[3] As it is written: the first time that this formula of Scriptural citation is used in the Bible. The reference (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/9/11'>11</a>) is to the sanctions of <a href='/NABRE/3/26/14'>LEV 26:14-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/28/15'>DEU 28:15-17</a>.
NABRE,27,9,21,[4] At the time of the evening offering: between three and four in the afternoon.
NABRE,27,9,24,"[5] Seventy weeks: i.e., of years. Just as Jeremiahs seventy years was an approximation (see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/27/9/2'>2</a>), the four hundred and ninety years here is not to be taken literally. Similarly, the distribution of the ""weeks"" in the following verses indicates only relative proportions of the total figure. A holy of holies: or ""most holy""; could be understood as a place (e.g., the Jerusalem Temple) or a person (cf. <a href='/NABRE/13/23/13'>1CH 23:13</a>)."
NABRE,27,9,25,"[6] From the utterance…to be rebuilt: from the time of Jeremiahs prophecy. Anointed ruler: either Cyrus, who was called the anointed of the Lord to end the exile (<a href='/NABRE/23/45/1'>ISA 45:1</a>), or the high priest Jeshua who presided over the rebuilding of the altar of sacrifice after the exile (<a href='/NABRE/15/3/2'>EZR 3:2</a>). Seven weeks: forty-nine years, an approximation of the time of the exile. In the course of sixty-two weeks…rebuilt: a period of four hundred thirty-four years, roughly approximating the interval between the rebuilding of Jerusalem after the exile and the beginning of the Seleucid persecution."
NABRE,27,9,26,"[7] An anointed one: the high priest Onias III, murdered in 171 B.C., from which the author dates the beginning of the persecution. Onias was in exile when he was killed. A leader: Antiochus IV."
NABRE,27,9,27,"[8] One week: the final phase of the period in view, the time of Antiochus persecution. He: Antiochus himself. The many: the faithless Jews who allied themselves with the Seleucids; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/1/11'>1MA 1:11-13</a>. Half the week: three and a half years; the Temple was desecrated by Antiochus from 167 to 164 B.C. The desolating abomination: see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/8/13'>8:13</a>; probably a pagan altar. Jesus refers to this passage in his prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/15'>MAT 24:15</a>."
NABRE,27,10,1,[1] 10:1-12:13 This final vision is concerned with history from the time of Cyrus to the death of Antiochus Epiphanes.
NABRE,27,10,1,"[2] A great war: or ""the service was great,"" or ""a mighty host."" The Hebrew is ambiguous."
NABRE,27,10,4,[3] The first month: the month Nisan (mid-March to mid-April).
NABRE,27,10,5,"[4] 10:5-6 The heavenly person of the vision is probably the angel Gabriel, as in <a href='/NABRE/27/9/21'>9:21</a>. Chrysolite: or topaz, a yellowish precious stone. Cf. the visions in <a href='/NABRE/26/1/1'>EZE 1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/26/1/8'>8</a>."
NABRE,27,10,13,"[5] The prince of the kingdom of Persia: the angelic guardian of Persia. Where older texts speak of the gods of various countries (<a href='/NABRE/5/32/8'>DEU 32:8</a>), Daniel speaks of ""princes."" Michael: the patron angel of Israel (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/10/21'>21</a>)."

NABRE,27,11,2,"[1] Three kings of Persia: it is unclear which kings are intended because there were more than three Persian kings between Cyrus and the dissolution of the kingdom. The fourth is Xerxes I (486-465 B.C.), the great campaigner against Greece."
NABRE,27,11,3,"[2] A powerful king: Alexander the Great, who broke Persian dominance by his victory at Issus in 333 B.C."
NABRE,27,11,5,"[3] 11:5-45 These verses describe the dynastic histories of the Ptolemies in Egypt (the king of the south) and the Seleucids in Syria (the king of the north), the two divisions of the Hellenistic empire that were of interest to the author (v. <a href='/NABRE/27/11/6'>6</a>). Verses 10-20 describe the struggle between the two kingdoms for the control of Palestine; the Seleucids were eventually victorious."
NABRE,27,11,6,"[4] The marriage of Antiochus II Theos and Berenice of Egypt about 250 B.C., which ended in tragedy."
NABRE,27,11,11,"[5] The battle of Raphia (217 B.C.), in which Egypt defeated Syria."
NABRE,27,11,13,[6] Syria defeated Egypt at the battle of Paneas in 200 B.C. Judea then passed under Syrian rule.
NABRE,27,11,15,[7] The siege of Sidon after the battle of Paneas.
NABRE,27,11,17,"[8] Antiochus III, the Great, betrothed his daughter to Ptolemy Epiphanes in 197 B.C."

NABRE,27,11,22,"[12] The prince of the covenant: the high priest Onias III, who was murdered."
NABRE,27,11,28,"[13] He: the king of the north, probably Antiochus IV."
NABRE,27,11,30,"[14] Kittim: originally this word meant Cypriots or other westerners. It is sometimes used for the Greeks (<a href='/NABRE/74/1/1'>1MA 1:1</a>). Here it refers to the Romans, who forced Antiochus to withdraw from Egypt during his second campaign there."
NABRE,27,11,34,"[15] Helped: this may be a reference to the Maccabean revolt. The apocalyptic author expects deliverance from God and has little regard for human efforts. In fact, the Maccabees routed the Syrian troops, recaptured Jerusalem, purified and rededicated the Temple, and brought to an end the Syrian persecution."
NABRE,27,11,37,"[16] The one in whom women delight: Tammuz. Antiochus favored the cult of Zeus. Daniel takes this to imply the neglect of all other gods, although this does not appear to have been the case."
NABRE,27,11,38,"[17] The god of strongholds: the god worshiped in the fortress Akra, which Antiochus established in Jerusalem."
NABRE,27,11,40,"[18] 11:40-45 In these concluding verses, the events described no longer correspond to the history of the Maccabean period. Daniel imagines the death of Antiochus on the model of Gog in <a href='/NABRE/26/38/1'>EZE 38</a>-<a href='/NABRE/26/39/1'>39</a>. Antiochus actually died in Persia."
NABRE,27,12,1,[1] Written in the book: cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/10/21'>10:21</a>.
NABRE,27,12,2,"[2] Many of those who sleep: Daniel does not envisage the universal resurrection as later developed. Two groups are distinguished, one that rises to eternal life, the other to reproach and disgrace. Then ""those with insight"" (<a href='/NABRE/27/11/33'>11:33-35</a>) are singled out for special honor."
NABRE,27,12,3,"[3] Like the stars: like the heavenly host, or angels. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/22/30'>MAT 22:30</a>."
NABRE,27,12,7,"[4] A time, two times, and half a time: see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/7/25'>7:25</a>."
NABRE,27,12,11,"[5] The specific numbers of days given in vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/12/11'>11-12</a> represent attempts to calculate the precise duration of the three and a half years. Most probably, when the first date (1,290 days) passed, the author attempted another calculation. Another, earlier calculation is preserved in <a href='/NABRE/27/8/14'>8:14</a>. It is noteworthy, however, that the contradictory numbers were allowed to stand in the text; this is a reminder that it is not possible to calculate a precise date for Gods judgment; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/13/32'>MAK 13:32</a>."
NABRE,27,13,1,"[1] 13:1-14:42 The short stories in these two chapters exist now only in Greek and other translations, but probably were first composed in Hebrew or Aramaic. They were never part of the Hebrew-Aramaic Book of Daniel, or of the Hebrew Bible. They are excluded from the Protestant canon of Scripture, but the Catholic Church has always included them among the inspired writings; they existed in the Septuagint, which was used as its Bible by the early church."
NABRE,27,13,55,"[2] 13:55-59 The contrast between the mastic tree, which is small, and the majestic oak emphasizes the contradiction between the statements of the two elders. In the Greek text there is a play on words between the names of these two trees and the mortal punishment decreed by Daniel for the elders. The mastic tree (schinon) sounds like the verb ""to split"" (schisai). The oak tree (prinon) suggests a play on poisai(to saw)."
NABRE,27,14,1,"[1] 14:1-22 In chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/14/1'>14</a>, readings in the Septuagint differ markedly from those in Theodotion, which is followed here. See individual notes on 1-3a, 10-11, 12-14, 15-17 and 21-22; the translation is that of Collins, Daniel, pp. 405ff, with brackets indicating additions to the Septuagint according to Collins."
NABRE,27,14,1,"[2] 14:1-3a These verses in the Septuagint Greek text read: ""From the prophecy of Habakkuk, son of Joshua, of the tribe of Levi. 2There was a certain man, a priest, whose name was Daniel, son of Abal, a companion of the king of Babylon. 3There was an idol, Bel, which the Babylonians revered,…"" This may represent an earlier form of the story, before it was attached to the Book of Daniel. King Astyages: the last of the Median kings, defeated by Cyrus in 550 B.C. This story preserves the fiction of a successive Median and Persian rule of Babylon."
NABRE,27,14,3,[3] Bel: see note on <a href='/NABRE/27/4/5'>4:5</a>.
NABRE,27,14,10,"[4] 14:10-11 These verses in the Septuagint Greek text read: ""(Now, there were seventy priests of Bel, apart from women and children.) They led the king to the idol shrine. 11The food was set out in the presence of the king and of Daniel, and mixed wine was brought in and set before Bel. Daniel said, You yourself see that these things are laid out, O king. You, therefore, seal the door of temple when it is closed. [The word pleased the king.]"""
NABRE,27,14,12,"[5] 14:12-14 Theodotions vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/14/12'>12-13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/27/14/14'>14</a>s ""After they departed the king set the food before Bel"" are lacking in the Septuagint Greek text, which continues vv. <a href='/NABRE/27/14/15'>15-17</a> from v. <a href='/NABRE/27/14/11'>11</a> as follows: ""Then Daniel commanded his attendants to make everyone go out from the temple and sprinkle the whole temple with ashes, unknown to anyone outside. Then he ordered them to apply the seal with the kings ring [and the seals of certain illustrious priests, and so it was done]."""
NABRE,27,14,15,"[6] 14:15-17 These verses in the Septuagint Greek text read: ""15On the next day they came to the place. But the priests of Bel had entered through false doors and had eaten all that was set forth for Bel and drunk the wine. Daniel said, See whether your seals remain, O priests, and you, O king, see that nothing has happened that seems improper to you. They found the seal as it had been, and they removed the seal."""
NABRE,27,14,19,[7] Note that here the king seems unaware of Daniels ruse.
NABRE,27,14,21,"[8] 14:21-22 These verses in the Septuagint Greek text read: ""21And he went to the house where the priests had come, and he found Bels food and the wine, and Daniel showed the king the false doors through which the priests entered and consumed what had been set before Bel. 22The king led them out of the temple of Bel and gave them over to Daniel. He gave Daniel what was expended on him and destroyed Bel."""
NABRE,27,14,23,"[9] Dragon: or ""serpent,"" and see v. <a href='/NABRE/27/14/27'>27</a>. Sacred snakes are well attested in the ancient world (e.g., in the temple of the god of healing Asclepius at Epidaurus), though evidence for their veneration in Babylon is doubtful."
NABRE,27,14,31,[10] A lions den: this story provides a different account from chap. <a href='/NABRE/27/6/1'>6</a> as to why Daniel was associated with the lions den.
NABRE,28,1,1,"[1] 1:1-3 This section begins with Hoseas marriage to Gomer, which symbolizes Israels relationship to God. Hence the symbolic names of Hoseas children and their later renaming (<a href='/NABRE/28/1/2'>1:2-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/2/1'>2:1-3</a>). The prophet foresees Gods punishment for the unfaithful covenant partner, but knows that Gods last word is always hope (<a href='/NABRE/28/2/4'>2:4-25</a>)."
NABRE,28,1,1,"[2] This superscription is from a Judean editor, who lists the kings of Judah in the south first, even though Hosea preached in the Northern Kingdom of Israel."
NABRE,28,1,2,[3] A woman of prostitution: this does not necessarily mean that Gomer was a prostitute when Hosea married her; the verse describes the event in its final consequences. Prostitution here may refer to Gomers participation in the worship of other gods.
NABRE,28,1,4,"[4] Give him the name ""Jezreel"": the names of the three children are symbolic, and predict Gods punishment in a crescendo. These names are frequently repeated in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/28/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/28/2/1'>2</a>. Jezreel: (lit., ""God will sow"") the strategic valley in northern Israel where Jehu brought the dynasty of Omri to an end through bloodshed (<a href='/NABRE/12/9/1'>2KG 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/10/1'>10</a>). Jeroboam II was the next to the last king of the house of Jehu. The prophecy in this verse of the end of the house of Jehu was fulfilled by the murder of Zechariah, son of Jeroboam II (<a href='/NABRE/12/15/8'>2KG 15:8-10</a>)."
NABRE,28,1,6,"[5] ""Not-Pitied"": in Hebrew lo-ruhama."
NABRE,28,1,7,"[6] Probably written by a later editor when the prophecies of Hosea circulated in the south, after the dissolution of the Northern Kingdom had occurred. The second part of the verse emphasizes the power of the Lord, who needs no human agents to fulfill the divine will. It may refer to the deliverance of Jerusalem from the siege of Sennacherib in 701 (<a href='/NABRE/12/19/35'>2KG 19:35-37</a>)."
NABRE,28,1,9,"[7] ""Not-My-People"": in Hebrew lo-ammi. I am not ""I am"" for you: a reference to the divine name revealed to Moses, ""I am"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/3/14'>EXO 3:14</a>). This reversal of the relationship marks the end of the covenant (<a href='/NABRE/2/6/7'>EXO 6:7</a>)."
NABRE,28,2,1,"[1] 2:1-3 These verses abruptly reverse the tone of the judgments of <a href='/NABRE/28/1/2'>1:2-9</a> with words of hope for the covenant people: the name Jezreel is given a positive interpretation in contrast to its negative meaning in <a href='/NABRE/28/1/4'>1:4</a>; the child named ""Not-Pitied"" in <a href='/NABRE/28/1/6'>1:6</a> is renamed ""Pitied"" in <a href='/NABRE/28/2/3'>2:3</a>; the child named ""Not-My-People"" is renamed ""My People."" The reversal of these names occurs again in <a href='/NABRE/28/2/25'>2:25</a>."
NABRE,28,2,4,"[2] 2:4-25 The section contains three oracles of doom (vv. <a href='/NABRE/28/2/4'>4-6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/28/2/7'>7-9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/28/2/10'>10-15</a>), a transition (vv. <a href='/NABRE/28/2/16'>16-17</a>), and three oracles of salvation (vv. <a href='/NABRE/28/2/18'>18-19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/28/2/20'>20-22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/28/2/23'>23-25</a>)."
NABRE,28,2,4,"[3] The Lord speaks of Israel, still using the example of Hoseas wife."
NABRE,28,2,5,"[4] I will strip her naked: it was the husbands responsibility to provide food and clothing for his wife (<a href='/NABRE/2/21/10'>EXO 21:10</a>) and now, because of her adultery, he takes back his support."
NABRE,28,2,7,"[5] My lovers: even though Israel had experienced the Lord as the God of the desert, covenant and conquest, the people were inclined to turn to the local fertility deities, the Baals, who were believed to be responsible for agricultural success. They easily forgot that the Lord provides them with everything (v. <a href='/NABRE/28/2/10'>10</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/7/13'>DEU 7:13</a>), and thus prostituted themselves by worshiping other gods."
NABRE,28,2,8,[6] The crop failures sent by the Lord are meant to make Israel see the folly of its ways.
NABRE,28,2,10,[7] For Baal: as an offering to Baal or to make statues of Baal.
NABRE,28,2,15,"[8] The days of the Baals: feast days of the Baal cult (v. <a href='/NABRE/28/2/13'>13</a>), or the whole period of Israels apostasy."
NABRE,28,2,16,"[9] Therefore: this word in Hebrew normally introduces an oracle of doom; here, surprisingly, it leads to hope. Allure: as though seducing a virgin (<a href='/NABRE/2/22/15'>EXO 22:15-16</a>). Ordinarily this word connotes deception (<a href='/NABRE/7/14/15'>JUG 14:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/16/5'>16:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/20'>1KG 22:20-22</a>)."
NABRE,28,2,17,"[10] Valley of Achor: lit., valley of trouble (<a href='/NABRE/6/7/26'>JOS 7:26</a>). Here this valley becomes a valley of hope, a new entry into the promised land."
NABRE,28,2,18,"[11] 2:18-19 Baal: the word means ""lord, master."" It was commonly used by women of their husbands, but it is to be shunned as a title for the Lord because of its association with the fertility gods, the Baals. Many Israelites saw little if any difference between the worship of the Lord and the worship of the Baals, thereby dishonoring the true source of the lands fertility."
NABRE,28,2,21,"[12] 2:21-22 Betroth…with: the betrothal was the legal moment before cohabitation when the dowry was paid to the father of the bride. In this remarriage the Lord gives the bride price to Israel herself ""forever."" Justice…judgment: refer to equity and fairness of conduct. The next two terms, ""loyalty"" (hesed), the steadfast love between the covenant partners, and ""compassion,"" maternal love (cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/1/6'>1:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/2/3'>2:3, 25</a>) are characteristic of Hosea. You shall know: not an abstract but a practical knowledge which means acknowledgment of Gods will and obedience to his law (<a href='/NABRE/28/4/1'>4:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/5/4'>5:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/6/3'>6:3, 6</a>)."
NABRE,28,3,1,"[1] 3:1-5 Just as the Lord is ready to take Israel back, Hosea takes his wife back. She must undergo a period of purification, just as Israel must experience purification before the restoration of the covenant relationship."
NABRE,28,3,1,"[2] Raisin cakes: offerings to the fertility goddess Asherah, the female counterpart of Baal, cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/7/18'>JER 7:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/44/19'>44:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/14/5'>DAN 14:5-8</a>."
NABRE,28,3,2,"[3] Just as the Lord offered a new bride price to Israel (<a href='/NABRE/28/2/21'>2:21-22</a>), so Hosea offers a new bride price to his wife. He returns to her what he has taken away from her (<a href='/NABRE/28/2/5'>2:5</a>): ""fifteen (shekels) of silver""; ""a homer of barley,"" a unit of dry measurement, which according to the etymology means ""a mule load""; and ""a lethech of barley,"" which is a half-homer."
NABRE,28,3,4,"[4] Israel will lose its political and cultic institutions. Sacred pillar: originally perhaps a phallic symbol, representing Baal. These were also used in Israelite worship (cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/1/28/18'>GEN 28:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/13'>EXO 34:13</a>). Ephod: an instrument used in consulting the deity (<a href='/NABRE/9/23/6'>1SM 23:6-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/30/7'>30:7</a>; cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/2/28/6'>EXO 28:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/28/15'>15-30</a>). Household gods: in Hebrew, teraphim; images regarded as the tutelary deities of the household (<a href='/NABRE/1/31/19'>GEN 31:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/17/5'>JUG 17:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/18/14'>18:14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/7/18/17'>17-18</a>)."

NABRE,28,4,4,[3] 4:4-6 Hosea is particularly severe with the priests in the Northern Kingdom who had led the way in the general apostasy from Gods law. The prophets here associated with the priests (v. <a href='/NABRE/28/4/5'>5</a>) were doubtless cult prophets; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/2/8'>JER 2:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/4/9'>4:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/6/13'>6:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/23/9'>23:9-40</a>.

Or ""Glory"" may refer to the Lord in contrast to Baal. The Hebrew word for shame, bosheth, is often substituted for Baal in biblical names. See Ishbaal (Heb. Ishbosheth, <a href='/NABRE/10/2/8'>2SM 2:8, 10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/2/12'>12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/10/2/15'>15</a>) and Meribaal (Heb.

NABRE,28,4,10,"[7] 4:10-11 Prostitution: often a synonym for idolatry. The covenant bond was symbolized as the relationship between husband and wife (see chaps. <a href='/NABRE/28/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/28/2/1'>2</a>). Thus, abandoning the Lord for a foreign god was called prostitution or adultery."
NABRE,28,4,12,"[8] Piece of wood: a derogatory term for an idol. Wand: a sacred wooden object, perhaps some kind of staff, used for divination."
NABRE,28,4,13,"[9] The shrines on the ""high places"" typically had an altar, a grove of trees, and a stone pillar representing a god (<a href='/NABRE/5/12/2'>DEU 12:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/2/20'>JER 2:20</a>)."
NABRE,28,4,14,[10] Temple women: plural of Heb. qedesha; the exact import of the term is disputed. See notes on <a href='/NABRE/1/38/21'>GEN 38:21</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/23/18'>DEU 23:18-19</a>.

Beth-aven: (lit., ""house of iniquity"") Hoseas derogatory term for the sanctuary of Bethel (lit., ""house of God""), the major shrine of the Northern Kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/28/10/5'>10:5, 8</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/5'>AMO 5:5</a>). As the Lord lives: a legitimate oath formula (<a href='/NABRE/9/26/10'>1SM 26:10, 16</a>), but unacceptable here because Israel is guilty of religious syncretism and the idolatrous worship of other gods."
NABRE,28,4,17,"[12] Ephraim: the name of one of the sons of Joseph, son of Jacob (<a href='/NABRE/1/41/52'>GEN 41:52</a>), also used to designate one of the tribes living in the heartland of the Northern Kingdom. Hosea often uses the name Ephraim to refer to the whole Northern Kingdom of Israel. During the latter part of his ministry, after the Assyrians occupied Galilee, Ephraim was all that remained of Israel."

NABRE,28,4,19,"[14] A wind: (Heb. ruah), a metaphor for Israels addiction to the Baal cult, which is nothing but wind, a ""spirit (ruah) of prostitution"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/28/4/12'>12</a>)."
NABRE,28,5,1,"[1] For you…judgment: possibly ""for you are called to judgment."""

Perhaps this is a wordplay on mishpat, ""justice,"" ""judgment."" Tabor: the mountain that dominates the valley of Jezreel. Shittim: in Transjordan, where Israel committed its first act of idolatry with the Baal of Peor (<a href='/NABRE/28/9/10'>9:10</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/25/1'>NUM 25</a>).

NABRE,28,5,8,"[4] 5:8-14 This passage describes political and military conflict between Judah and Israel. Perhaps some allusion is made to the Syro-Ephraimite war of 735-734 B.C., when a coalition of Arameans and Israelites attempted to dethrone the king of Judah (<a href='/NABRE/12/16/5'>2KG 16:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/7/1'>ISA 7:1-9</a>). Judah repulsed the attempt with the aid of Assyria, and the latter devastated both Aram and Israel."

NABRE,28,5,10,[6] Move a boundary line: invasion by Judah (v. <a href='/NABRE/28/5/8'>8</a>) is compared to a case of social injustice (<a href='/NABRE/5/19/14'>DEU 19:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/27/17'>27:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/23/10'>PRO 23:10-11</a>).

Under the threat of the Syro-Ephraimite invasion King Ahaz of Judah also submitted to Tiglath-pileser (<a href='/NABRE/12/16/7'>2KG 16:7-9</a>). Great king: Heb. melek-yarev; may be a proper name: King Yarev, but unknown; or ""the defender king"": irony about the great king of Assyria (see note on <a href='/NABRE/28/10/6'>10:6</a>)."

NABRE,28,6,11,"[6] Harvest: Gods judgment, when Judah will reap what it has sown."
NABRE,28,7,3,"[1] 7:3-7 This passage perhaps refers to a conspiracy at the royal court. Between the death of Jeroboam II (743 B.C.) and the fall of Samaria (722/721), nearly all the kings were murdered (<a href='/NABRE/12/15/10'>2KG 15:10, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/15/25'>25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/12/15/30'>30</a>)."
NABRE,28,7,4,"[2] Adulterers: the unfaithful nobles who kill the king. Their passion is compared to the fire of the oven. The point of the metaphor is that, like this oven whose fire is always ready to blaze up again, the conspirators are always ready for rebellion."
NABRE,28,7,8,"[3] Is mixed with the nations: the people reject exclusive allegiance to the Lord, and they now try to find their salvation in alliances with foreign nations. An unturned cake: burnt on one side, but not baked at all on the other, and thus worthless."

NABRE,28,8,4,"[3] Hosea is not against the monarchy, but against the conspiracies at the royal court (see note on <a href='/NABRE/28/7/3'>7:3-7</a>). The king should be chosen by God (<a href='/NABRE/11/19/15'>1KG 19:15-16</a>)."

NABRE,28,8,10,[6] I will now gather them: for judgment and for deportation.
NABRE,28,8,11,[7] The altars had become places of self-serving worship (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/28/8/13'>13</a>).

NABRE,28,9,4,[2] Mourners bread: bread eaten at funeral rites (<a href='/NABRE/5/26/14'>DEU 26:14</a>). The presence of a corpse also made all food prepared in that house unclean (<a href='/NABRE/24/16/5'>JER 16:5-7</a>).
NABRE,28,9,5,"[3] The Lords feast: probably the important autumn feast of Booths, the most important of the Israelite public celebrations (<a href='/NABRE/3/23/34'>LEV 23:34</a>)."
NABRE,28,9,6,"[4] Instead of gathering for celebration (v. <a href='/NABRE/28/9/5'>5</a>), they will be gathered for death. Memphis: known for the monumental pyramid tombs. Silver treasures: the silver statues of Baal (<a href='/NABRE/28/8/4'>8:4</a>)."

NABRE,28,9,9,"[6] The days of Gibeah: the precise allusion is not clear. Perhaps it is a reference to the outrage committed at Gibeah in the days of the judges (<a href='/NABRE/7/19/1'>JUG 19</a>-<a href='/NABRE/7/21/1'>21</a>), or to questions surrounding Sauls kingship at Gibeah (<a href='/NABRE/9/10/26'>1SM 10:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/14/2'>14:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/22/6'>22:6</a>)."

NABRE,28,9,15,"[8] Gilgal: possibly a reference to Sauls disobedience to Samuel (<a href='/NABRE/9/13/7'>1SM 13:7-14</a>; 15), or to the idolatry practiced in that place (see note on <a href='/NABRE/28/4/15'>HOS 4:15</a>)."
NABRE,28,9,16,"[9] Wordplay on the Hebrew word for ""fruit"" (peri) and Ephraim (see note on <a href='/NABRE/28/8/9'>8:9</a>). The whole passage (vv. <a href='/NABRE/28/9/10'>10-17</a>) presents a reversal of Ephraims name (<a href='/NABRE/1/41/52'>GEN 41:52</a>). He will have no fruit, a condition which will result in extinction."
NABRE,28,10,1,[1] Sacred pillars: see note on <a href='/NABRE/28/3/4'>3:4</a>.
NABRE,28,10,3,[2] No king: the instability of the monarchy (<a href='/NABRE/28/7/3'>7:3-7</a>) and its vassalage to foreign kings (<a href='/NABRE/28/7/8'>7:8-16</a>) render the monarchy ineffective. The kings do the opposite of what they are supposed to do (<a href='/NABRE/28/10/4'>10:4</a>).
NABRE,28,10,4,"[3] Lawsuits…like poisonous weeds: the administration of justice, which should have been the mainstay of the people, has in corrupt hands become another instrument of oppression; cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/6/12'>AMO 6:12</a>."

NABRE,28,10,10,[7] Two crimes: the allusion is not clear; a possible reference is the outrage described in <a href='/NABRE/7/19/1'>JUG 19</a>.
NABRE,28,10,14,"[8] As Salman ravaged Beth-arbel: perhaps Salamanu, king of Moab, mentioned in an inscription of Tiglath-pileser III, after an invasion in Gilead (Transjordan), where there was a Beth-arbel, close to present Irbid."

NABRE,28,11,1,[2] Out of Egypt: Hosea dates the real beginning of Israel from the time of the exodus. <a href='/NABRE/40/2/15'>MAT 2:15</a> applies this text to the return of Jesus from Egypt.
NABRE,28,11,4,"[3] I drew them…with bands of love: perhaps a reversal of the yoke imagery of the previous chapter, i.e., not forcing them like draft animals, but drawing them with kindness and affection."
NABRE,28,11,8,"[4] Admah…Zeboiim: cities in the vicinity of Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href='/NABRE/1/14/2'>GEN 14:2, 8</a>) and destroyed with them (<a href='/NABRE/1/19/24'>GEN 19:24-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/29/22'>DEU 29:22</a>)."

NABRE,28,12,14,[5] A prophet: Moses.
NABRE,28,13,1,[1] Exalted in Israel: Ephraim enjoyed a privileged position in Israel (<a href='/NABRE/1/48/14'>GEN 48:14-19</a>).
NABRE,28,13,2,[2] Kiss calves: apparently a reference to a ritual gesture associated with the worship of Baal represented as a calf (<a href='/NABRE/11/19/18'>1KG 19:18</a>).
NABRE,28,13,4,"[3] I, the Lord…land of Egypt: according to <a href='/NABRE/11/12/28'>1KG 12:28</a>, Jeroboam introduced the calves used in the worship at the sanctuaries in Bethel and Dan with the words: ""Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt."""
NABRE,28,13,9,"[4] 13:9-10 Only God can save Israel, not the king, whom Israel had requested from the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/9/8/1'>1SM 8:1-9</a>)."
NABRE,28,13,11,[5] I give you a king…in my wrath: the Lord punished the people of the Northern Kingdom by giving them kings who were soon deposed (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/28/7/3'>7:3-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/8/4'>8:4</a>).

Paul uses this text in a different way to speak about the victory over death (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/54'>1CO 15:54-55</a>)."
NABRE,28,13,15,"[8] Although ""Ephraim"" is not explicitly mentioned in the text (the Hebrew text has the word ""he""), the wordplay with the Hebrew word for ""flourish"" (yaphrî) suggests the use of ""Ephraim"" in the translation. Wind: possibly Assyria."
NABRE,28,14,1,"[1] Samaria: the capital of the Northern Kingdom will fall; this is the punishment predicted for Ephraim, the Northern Kingdom."
NABRE,28,14,4,"[2] These good intentions promise a reversal of Israels sins: no more reliance on ""Assyria,"" i.e., on foreign alliances (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/28/8/9'>8:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/12/2'>12:2</a>), on ""horses,"" i.e., on human power (<a href='/NABRE/28/10/13'>10:13</a>), and on idolatry (<a href='/NABRE/28/8/4'>8:4-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/13/2'>13:2</a>).

NABRE,28,14,9,"[3] Verdant cypress tree: the symbol of lasting life, the opposite of the sacred trees of the Baal cult (<a href='/NABRE/28/4/13'>4:13</a>). The Lord provides the ""fruit"" (peri) to Israel (<a href='/NABRE/28/2/7'>2:7, 10</a>), another instance of the wordplay on Ephraim (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/28/9/16'>9:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/13/15'>13:15</a>)."
NABRE,28,14,10,[4] A challenge to the reader in the style of the wisdom literature.
NABRE,29,1,4,"[1] Cutter…swarming locust…hopper…consuming locust: these names may refer to various species of locusts, or to some phases in the insects life cycle, or to successive waves of locusts ravaging the countryside."
NABRE,29,1,5,"[2] Drunkards: this metaphor expresses both the urgency behind Joels preaching and his ironic assessment of his audience. There are no grapes to process into new wine, yet people view their situation as just another agricultural crisis. Joel argues that the problems they now face are lessons the Lord is using to provide the knowledge they lack."
NABRE,29,1,6,"[3] A nation: the locusts are compared to an invading army, whose numbers are overwhelming. The ravaged landscape resembles the wasteland left behind by marauding troops; the order and peace associated with agricultural productivity (<a href='/NABRE/11/5/5'>1KG 5:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/4/4'>MIC 4:4</a>) has been destroyed."
NABRE,29,1,8,"[4] Like a young woman: this simile personifies Jerusalem as a youthful widow, left unprotected and without resources by her husbands sudden death."
NABRE,29,1,10,"[5] The farmland mourns: or ""the farmland is dried up."""
NABRE,29,1,13,[6] Judahs situation is so grave and the day of the Lord so imminent that priests must lament day and night if they hope to reverse the divine punishment.
NABRE,29,1,15,"[7] As in <a href='/NABRE/30/5/18'>AMO 5:18-20</a>, the day of the Lord in Joels first speech brings punishment, not victory, for Judah. In his second speech, this event means victory for those faithful to the Lord and death for the nations who are the Lords enemies. Almighty: Hebrew shaddai. There is wordplay between shod(""destruction"") and shaddai."
NABRE,29,1,16,"[8] Before our very eyes: Joels audience should have discerned the significance of the winter drought and the locust invasion they witnessed. Joy and gladness: the loss of field crops has reduced Joels audience to subsistence living, with no means for liturgical or personal celebration, as in v. <a href='/NABRE/29/1/12'>12</a>."
NABRE,29,1,17,"[9] The seed…clods of dirt: the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Most commentators use the translation given here, since it fits the prophets description of an agricultural year plagued by winter drought and a spring locust infestation."
NABRE,29,1,18,"[10] 1:18-19 In figurative language, Joel describes how the insufficient winter rain, the locust invasions, and summers heat on pasture lands and water sources drive domestic and wild animals to cry out for rain."
NABRE,29,2,1,"[1] 2:1-11 Joel warns the people about the destruction he sees galloping toward Jerusalem. He combines the imagery of the locust invasion (chap. <a href='/NABRE/29/1/1'>1</a>) with language from the holy war tradition in order to describe the Lord leading a heavenly army against the enemy, in this case, Jerusalem."
NABRE,29,2,2,[2] Like dawn: from the east comes dark destruction rather than a new days light.
NABRE,29,2,3,[3] Before it: fire precedes and follows the armys advance. Even the ravaged landscape of chap. <a href='/NABRE/29/1/1'>1</a> looks like a lush garden compared to the devastation this army leaves behind.
NABRE,29,2,14,[4] Blessing: the rain that makes possible the grapes and grain (v. <a href='/NABRE/29/2/19'>19</a>) that workers will process into Temple offerings.
NABRE,29,2,16,[5] Elderly…infants…bridegroom…bride: Jerusalem is in such great danger that even those normally excused from fasting or working are called upon to participate in activities to ward off the imminent catastrophe.
NABRE,29,2,17,[6] Between the porch and the altar: the priests stood in the open space between the outdoor altar for burnt offerings and the Temple building.
NABRE,29,2,18,[7] Jealous: the Hebrew word describes the passionate empathetic bond the Lord has with Israel. The peoples wholehearted participation in Joels call for fasting and prayer sparks the Lords longing to protect and love his people Israel. This desire moves him to withhold punishment and to send the blessing of v. <a href='/NABRE/29/2/14'>14</a> instead.
NABRE,29,2,20,"[8] The northerner: the locusts, pictured as an invading army, which traditionally came from the north (<a href='/NABRE/24/1/14'>JER 1:14-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/26/7'>EZE 26:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/38/6'>38:6, 15</a>). Locusts are not usually an annual threat in Palestine, nor are they often associated with the north. However, to demonstrate the extent of the Lords care for Judah and control over what happens within its borders, Joel assures his audience that the Lord will quickly drive the locusts out of Judah the coming spring, should they reappear. Dead locusts will litter the shores of the ""eastern"" (the Dead Sea) and the ""western"" (the Mediterranean) seas."
NABRE,29,2,23,"[9] This autumn rain teaches the people to recognize Gods compassionate presence in nature and history. There is a play on the double meaning of the Hebrew word moreh: ""early rain"" and ""teacher."" In the Dead Sea Scrolls, the word is used in the phrase ""teacher (= moreh) of righteousness."""
NABRE,29,3,1,"[1] 3:1-5 In many places in the Old Testament, Hebrew ruahis Gods power, or spirit, bestowed on chosen individuals. The word can also mean ""breath"" or ""wind."" In this summary introduction to his second speech, Joel anticipates that the Lord will someday renew faithful Judahites with the divine spirit. In <a href='/NABRE/44/2/17'>ACT 2:17-21</a> the author has Peter cite Joels words to suggest that the newly constituted Christian community, filled with divine life and power, inaugurates the Lords Day, understood as salvation for all who believe that Jesus of Nazareth is the Christ."
NABRE,29,4,2,"[1] Valley of Jehoshaphat: one of the symbolic names of the place of punishment for Judahs enemies; the other is ""Valley of Decision"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/29/4/14'>14</a>). The name Jehoshaphat means ""the Lord judges."" If the popular identification of this place as the Kidron Valley is accurate, Joel may imagine the Lord seated above the valley on Mount Zion directing his troops in the destruction of nations in the valley below."
NABRE,29,4,4,"[2] 4:4-8 This prose material may be a later addition to the book. It illustrates a common biblical theme (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/7/16'>PS 7:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/9/16'>9:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/35/8'>35:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/37/14'>37:14-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/57/7'>57:7</a>), having ones evil deed (selling Judahites into slavery) turned into ones own punishment (being sold into slavery by the Judahites)."
NABRE,29,4,8,"[3] Sabeans: traders from the southwestern tip of the Arabian peninsula, present-day Yemen (cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/10/1'>1KG 10:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/72/10'>PS 72:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/6/20'>JER 6:20</a>)."
NABRE,29,4,10,"[4] The Lord directs the troops to forge military weapons out of the agricultural tools necessary for life during peacetime. In <a href='/NABRE/23/2/4'>ISA 2:4</a> and <a href='/NABRE/33/4/3'>MIC 4:3</a>, both in contexts presuming the defeat of Israels enemies, this imagery is reversed."
NABRE,29,4,13,"[5] Their crimes are numerous: the nations are ripe for punishment. Joel uses the vocabulary of the autumn grape harvest to describe the assault of the Lords army against these nations. In <a href='/NABRE/23/63/1'>ISA 63:1-6</a>, grape harvest imagery also controls the description of the Lords return from Edom with blood-spattered clothing after having trod his enemies into the ground as if they were grapes (cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/25/30'>JER 25:30</a>)."
NABRE,29,4,17,"[6] Then you will know: this verse further develops the motif of knowledge introduced in <a href='/NABRE/29/2/27'>2:27</a>. The Judahites will learn that the Lord is present in their economic prosperity and political autonomy, even though they did not associate Gods presence with their crop failure."
NABRE,29,4,18,"[7] Images of agricultural abundance illustrate the harmony and order Joel expects the Lord to establish in Judah; like <a href='/NABRE/29/2/18'>2:18-27</a>, this section reverses the deprivation and drought of chap. <a href='/NABRE/29/1/1'>1</a>. A spring…house of the Lord: streams of water flowing from the Temple of an ideal Jerusalem also appear in <a href='/NABRE/26/47/1'>EZE 47:1</a>. The Valley of Shittim: or ""the ravine of the acacia trees""; while there is a Shittim east of the Jordan, the reference here is probably to that rocky part of the Kidron Valley southeast of Jerusalem, an arid region where acacia trees flourished."
NABRE,30,1,1,"[1] The earthquake: a major earthquake during the reign of Uzziah (ca. 783-742 B.C.), so devastating that it was remembered long afterwards (cf. <a href='/NABRE/38/14/5'>ZEC 14:5</a>). See the description of an earthquake in Amoss final vision (<a href='/NABRE/30/9/1'>9:1</a>)."
NABRE,30,1,2,"[2] Significantly, the roar comes to the Northern Kingdom from Jerusalem. This verse, perhaps an editorial remark, sets the tone of Amoss message."
NABRE,30,1,3,[3] 1:3-2:16 All the nations mentioned here may have been part of the ideal empire of David-Solomon (cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/5/1'>1KG 5:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/14/25'>2KG 14:25</a>). Certain standards of conduct were expected not only in their relations with Israel but also with one another.
NABRE,30,1,3,"[4] For three crimes…and now four: this formula (n, n + 1) is frequent in poetry (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/20/6/16'>PRO 6:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/20/30/18'>30:18-19</a>). The progression ""three"" followed by ""four"" here suggests a climax. The fourth crime is one too many and exhausts the Lords forbearance."
NABRE,30,1,4,[5] Hazael…Ben-hadad: kings of the Arameans whose capital was Damascus (v. <a href='/NABRE/30/1/5'>5</a>); they fought against Israel (<a href='/NABRE/12/13/3'>2KG 13:3</a>) and had long occupied the region of Gilead (v. <a href='/NABRE/30/1/3'>3</a>) in Transjordan.
NABRE,30,1,5,"[6] Valley of Aven: lit., ""valley of wickedness,"" perhaps a distortion of a place name in Aramean territory, identity unknown. Beth-eden: an Aramean city-state on the Euphrates, about two hundred miles northeast of Damascus, called Bit-adiniin Assyro-Babylonian texts. Kir: cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/9/7'>9:7</a>; probably to be identified with the city of Emar on the Euphrates, a major Aramean center in the Late Bronze Age. One text from this site calls the king of Emar ""the king of the people of the land of Kir."""
NABRE,30,1,9,"[7] Did not remember their covenant of brotherhood: standard diplomatic language of this period, meaning ""violated the treaty."" The violation may not have been against Israel itself but against a fellow ""subject"" nation of the ideal Davidic-Solomonic empire (cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/2/1'>2:1</a>)."
NABRE,30,1,11,"[8] Pursued his brother: ""brother"" here may denote a fellow vassal or subject of Israel."
NABRE,30,1,12,[9] Teman…Bozrah: two of the chief cities of Edom; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/49/20'>JER 49:20</a>.
NABRE,30,1,14,"[10] Rabbah: now called Amman, the modern capital of Jordan."
NABRE,30,2,1,"[1] He burned to ashes: to the peoples of the Near East, burning the bones of the dead was a particularly heinous crime, as it was believed to cause the spirits of these dead to wander without any hope of interment in their graves, where they could rest in peace."
NABRE,30,2,4,"[2] 2:4-8, 12 Unlike the crimes of the nations detailed in this section, which are wrongs against other nations, those of Judah and Israel named here are violations of the Lords demands."
NABRE,30,2,4,[3] The lies: false gods worshiped by the Judahites.
NABRE,30,2,6,"[4] Israel: Amoss audience would applaud his condemnation of foreign kingdoms in the foregoing seven oracles, especially of Judah. But now he adds an eighth, unexpected oracle—against Israel itself. This is the real ""punch line"" of this whole section, to which the preceding oracles serve mainly as introduction."
NABRE,30,2,7,"[5] Son and father sleep with the same girl: the crime condemned here may be the misuse of power by the rich who take unfair advantage of young women from the ranks of the poor and force themselves on them, thus adding oppression to the sin of impurity."
NABRE,30,2,8,"[6] Upon garments…any altar: creditors kept the garments taken as pledges from the poor instead of returning them to their owners before nightfall as the law commanded (<a href='/NABRE/2/22/25'>EXO 22:25</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/24/12'>DEU 24:12</a>). Wine…in their temples: lavish feasts for the rich, serving the finest wines in great abundance (see <a href='/NABRE/30/6/4'>6:4-7</a>) and funded by the treasuries of local temples (e.g., at Dan and Bethel). The Hebrew in this verse is difficult. Another possible translation would be: ""And the wine of those who have been fined / they drink in the house of their god."""
NABRE,30,2,11,[7] Nazirites: see note on <a href='/NABRE/4/6/2'>NUM 6:2-21</a>. Oracle of the Lord: a phrase used extensively in prophetic books to indicate divine speech.
NABRE,30,3,2,"[1] You alone I have known: precisely because Israel enjoyed a special status among the nations of the world in the eyes of the Lord (but see <a href='/NABRE/30/9/7'>9:7</a>) it was called to a high degree of fidelity to God. Because Israel has failed in this expectation, it must experience Gods punishment."
NABRE,30,3,3,"[2] 3:3-8 The metaphors in these sayings illustrate the principle of cause and effect, and lead up to the conclusion in v. <a href='/NABRE/30/3/8'>8</a>."
NABRE,30,3,9,"[3] Assyria: following the Greek version, the Hebrew text has ""Ashod."" It is supposed that this was a copyists error: ""Assyria"" seems intended, in order to parallel ""Egypt"" in the next line."
NABRE,30,3,9,"[4] With a keen sense of irony, Amos invites the most powerful oppressors in Israels memory, past and present—Egypt and Assyria—to see and marvel at the great oppression and injustice being wrought within Samaria by the people of Israel."
NABRE,30,3,12,"[5] The ""escape"" is clearly a disaster, not a deliverance."
NABRE,30,3,14,"[6] On Bethel, see also <a href='/NABRE/30/4/4'>4:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/5/5'>5:5-6</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/30/7/13'>7:13</a>. The prophet is condemning the religiosity and formalism of the worship by Israels leaders."
NABRE,30,4,1,"[1] Cows of Bashan: the pampered women of Samaria; Bashan was a region east of the Sea of Galilee, famous for its rich pasture and fattened herds."
NABRE,30,4,3,"[2] Harmon: or perhaps ""Mount Mon""; an unidentified site, probably far to the north of Israel, under the control of Assyria."
NABRE,30,4,4,"[3] Come to Bethel: Amoss invitation to the people to come and ""sin"" at two of the major religious centers in Samaria is sarcastic. His point is that sacrifice and worship without justice is an abomination to the God of Israel; cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/21'>5:21-24</a>."
NABRE,30,4,12,"[4] Therefore thus I will do to you: this climax of vv. <a href='/NABRE/30/4/6'>6-12</a>, announcing the sentence the Lord intends to pass on Israel, is open-ended."
NABRE,30,5,1,"[1] 5:1-17 These verses form a chiastic section beginning and ending with a lament over Israel (vv. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/2'>2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/30/5/16'>16-17</a>) and containing a double appeal to ""seek"" the Lord (vv. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/30/5/14'>14</a>). This editorial arrangement gives the whole section a negative cast, in effect nullifying the only hopeful verse in Amos (v. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/15'>15</a>). Israel is as good as dead."
NABRE,30,5,4,"[2] 5:4-5 For thus says the Lord…Bethel shall be no more: these two verses continue the sarcasm of <a href='/NABRE/30/4/4'>4:4-5</a>, verses in which Amos invites the people to come and ""sin"" at Bethel and Gilgal. The cult cities of Samaria should have been places where God could be ""sought"" but, because of the sins of the Northern Kingdom, these cities would cease to exist."
NABRE,30,5,6,[3] These verses have been rearranged to achieve the proper sequence according to the best possible manuscript tradition. Cf. the Textual Notes accompanying the translation.
NABRE,30,5,6,"[4] House of Joseph: the kingdom of Israel or Northern Kingdom, the chief tribes of which were descended from Ephraim and Manasseh, the sons of Joseph; cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/15'>5:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/6/6'>6:6</a>."
NABRE,30,5,18,"[5] The day of the Lord: first mentioned in Amos, this refers to a specific time in the future, known to the Lord alone, when Gods enemies would be decisively defeated. The common assumption among Israelites was that the Lords foes and Israels foes were one and the same. But Amos makes it clear that because the people have become Gods enemies by refusing to heed the prophetic word, they too would experience the divine wrath on that fateful day. However, during the exile this expression comes to mean a time when God would avenge Israel against its oppressors and bring about its restoration (<a href='/NABRE/24/50/27'>JER 50:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/30/3'>EZE 30:3-5</a>)."
NABRE,30,5,21,[6] 5:21-27 The prophet does not condemn cultic activity as such but rather the peoples attempt to offer worship with hands unclean from oppression of their fellow Israelites (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/15/2'>PS 15:2-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/24/3'>24:3-4</a>). But worship from those who disregard justice and righteousness (v. <a href='/NABRE/30/5/24'>24</a>) is never acceptable to the God of Israel. Through the Sinai covenant the love of God and the love of neighbor are inextricably bound together.
NABRE,30,5,26,"[7] Sukuth: probably a hebraized form of Assyro-Babylonian Shukudu(""the Arrow""), a name of Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky. It was associated with the god Ninurta, who was widely worshiped in Mesopotamia. According to <a href='/NABRE/12/17/30'>2KG 17:30</a> the cult of Sirius was introduced into Samaria by deportees from Babylonia. Kaiwan: a hebraized form of an Akkadian name for the planet Saturn, also worshiped as a deity in Mesopotamia."
NABRE,30,6,2,"[1] Calneh…Hamath…Gath: city-states overcome by the Assyrians in the eighth century B.C., whose fate should be a lesson to the Israelites. The prophet castigates the leaders for being more intent on pursuing a luxurious lifestyle (vv. <a href='/NABRE/30/6/1'>1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/30/6/4'>4-6</a>) than reading the signs of the times."
NABRE,30,6,10,"[2] In this desperate situation there seems to be a profound fear of the Lord, who is the cause of the deaths (cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/3/6'>3:6</a>)."
NABRE,30,6,13,"[3] Lodebar…Karnaim: two towns recaptured from Judah by Israelite forces during the reign of Jeroboam II (see <a href='/NABRE/12/14/25'>2KG 14:25</a>). Some mockery of at least the first of these victories is probably intended by the prophet here, as Lodebar can be translated ""nothing."""
NABRE,30,6,14,"[4] A nation: Assyria. Lebo-hamath…Wadi Arabah: the territorial limits of Solomons kingdom, north and south respectively, as re-established by Jeroboam II (see <a href='/NABRE/12/14/25'>2KG 14:25</a>)."
NABRE,30,7,1,[1] The kings mowing: the first harvesting of the crops apparently belonged to the king as a kind of tax.
NABRE,30,7,7,"[2] A plummet: with this vision, the pleas of the prophet (vv. <a href='/NABRE/30/7/1'>1-6</a>) disappear, and disaster is announced. One use of the plummet in ancient times was to see how far out of line a wall or building had become, to determine whether it could be repaired or would have to be torn down. Like a structure that had become architecturally unsound, Israel was unsalvageable and would have to be demolished (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/21/13'>2KG 21:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/34/11'>ISA 34:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/25/2/8'>LAM 2:8</a>)."
NABRE,30,7,14,"[3] I am not a prophet: Amos reacts strongly to Amaziahs attempt to classify him as a ""prophet-for-hire"" who ""earns [his] bread"" by giving oracles in exchange for payment (cf. <a href='/NABRE/9/9/3'>1SM 9:3-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/3/5'>MIC 3:5</a>). To disassociate himself from this kind of ""professional"" prophet, Amos rejects outright the title of nabi(""prophet""). By profession he is a herdsman/sheepbreeder and a dresser of sycamore trees, but Gods call has commissioned him to prophesy to Israel."
NABRE,30,8,1,"[1] 8:1-2 End-of-summer fruit…the end has come: the English translation attempts to capture the wordplay of the Hebrew. The Hebrew word for ""fruit picked late in the season"" is qayis, while the word for ""end"" is qes."
NABRE,30,8,5,[2] Ephah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,30,8,14,"[3] Ashima of Samaria: a high-ranking goddess worshiped in Hamath, whose cult was transplanted by the people of that city when they were deported to Samaria by the Assyrians (<a href='/NABRE/12/17/30'>2KG 17:30</a>). The Power of Beer-sheba: possibly an epithet of a deity worshiped in Beer-sheba, either a syncretistic form of the worship of Israels God or of another god. Dan…Beer-sheba: the traditional designation for the northern and southern limits of Israel to which the Israelites made pilgrimages."
NABRE,30,9,1,"[1] This vision may describe the destruction of the temple at Bethel and the fulfillment of the oracle in <a href='/NABRE/30/3/14'>3:14</a>, linking Gods judgment upon Israel with the ""punishment"" of the altars of Bethel. This dramatic event (perhaps to be identified with the earthquake mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/30/1/1'>1:1</a>) symbolizes the end of the Northern Kingdom as the Lords people, the consequence of their steadfast refusal to heed the prophetic word and return to the God of Israel."
NABRE,30,9,3,"[2] The serpent: a name for the primeval chaos monster, vanquished by God at the time of creation but not annihilated. He was a personification of the sea, another primary archetype of chaos in the ancient Near East."
NABRE,30,9,7,"[3] The Ethiopians…the Philistines…the Arameans: although Israels relationship to the Lord was special, even unique in some respects (<a href='/NABRE/30/3/2'>3:2</a>), Israel was not the only people on earth that God cared for. Striking here is the reference to divine intervention in the history of the Philistines and Arameans, not unlike the Lords saving intervention to bring Israel out of Egypt. Caphtor: the island of Crete."
NABRE,30,9,11,"[4] 9:11-15 These verses are most likely an editorial supplement to Amos, added to bring the book into harmony with the positive thrust of the prophetic books in general, especially those written after the exile, when the final edition of Amos was probably completed. The editors would have seen the destruction of Samaria in 722/721 B.C. as the fulfillment of Amoss prophecies, but in this epilogue they express the view that destruction was not the Lords final word for Israel. In <a href='/NABRE/44/15/15'>ACT 15:15-17</a>, James interprets this passage in a messianic sense. The fallen hut of David: the Davidic kingdom, which included what later became the divided Northern and Southern Kingdoms. All nations claimed in my name: lit., ""all nations over whom my name has been pronounced."" This idiom denotes ownership."
NABRE,30,9,14,"[5] Rebuild…inhabit…plant…drink: in this era of restoration, the Lord nullifies the curse of <a href='/NABRE/30/5/11'>5:11</a>, which uses these same four verbs, and turns it into a blessing for Israel."
NABRE,31,1,3,[1] 3 Edom occupied the mountains southeast of Israel and the Dead Sea.
NABRE,31,1,5,"[2] 5 Something of value may escape the thief, and the grape picker always leaves something for the gleaners, but Gods devastation of Edom will be complete."
NABRE,31,1,6,"[3] 6 With the past tense in vv. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/5'>5-7</a>, the prophet presents a future event as if it had already happened."
NABRE,31,1,7,"[4] 7 Those who eat your bread: alliances were often established by covenant meals (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/31/44'>GEN 31:44-46</a>). When Edom is destroyed, foreigners will replace the Edomites, who were known for wisdom (cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/8'>8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/49/7'>JER 49:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/2/11'>JOB 2:11</a>)."
NABRE,31,1,9,"[5] 9 Teman: a synonym for Edom; perhaps the name of a region or a city, the part representing the whole. Mount Esau: whatever its geographic reference, the phrase is an effective representation of Edoms arrogance."
NABRE,31,1,10,"[6] 10 Your brother: used with a double meaning referring to the common lineage of Israel and Edom, in which their ancestors were brothers, Jacob and Esau (<a href='/NABRE/1/25/19'>GEN 25:19-26</a>), and referring also to their political alliance, in which allies were called brothers (cf. <a href='/NABRE/30/1/9'>AMO 1:9, 11</a>)."
NABRE,31,1,11,"[7] 11 In 587 B.C., Edomites joined the invading Babylonian forces (v. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/13'>13</a>) and captured escaping Judahites. The destruction of Jerusalem strengthened and expanded Edoms hold on Judahs southern territory."
NABRE,31,1,12,[8] 12-14 The commands in vv. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/12'>12-14</a> are not to be understood as future prohibitions but as descriptions of crimes Edom in fact already committed on the day of Jerusalems fall described in v. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/11'>11</a>.
NABRE,31,1,16,"[9] 16 As you drank: i.e., Judah has suffered the punishment of divine wrath in 587 B.C. The oracle promises a similar fate for the nations, especially Edom (v. <a href='/NABRE/31/1/18'>18</a>). The metaphor ""drinking the cup of Gods wrath"" occurs often in the Bible; cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/21/20'>JOB 21:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/17'>ISA 51:17-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/25/15'>JER 25:15-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/14/10'>REV 14:10</a>."
NABRE,31,1,17,[10] 17-19 The Israelites will be restored and will occupy the lands of those who oppressed them. The survivors of Judah will be rejoined by the returned exiles from northern Israel.
NABRE,31,1,19,[11] 19 Negeb: the area south of Judah and west of Edom. Gilead: east of the Jordan River.
NABRE,31,1,20,"[12] 20 Zarephath: a town in Phoenicia, north of Tyre; cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/17/10'>1KG 17:10</a>. Sepharad: perhaps Sardis in western Asia Minor. The later rabbis thought it was Spain."
NABRE,31,1,21,"[13] 21 Deliverers: the victorious Israelites who will rule over their enemies, as the ancient judges did; cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/3/9'>JUG 3:9, 15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/7/3/31'>31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/10/1'>10:1</a>."
NABRE,32,1,1,"[14] Jonah, son of Amittai: a prophet of this name lived at the time of Jeroboam II (786-746 B.C.)."
NABRE,32,1,2,"[15] Great city: exaggeration is characteristic of this book; the word ""great"" (Heb. gadol) occurs fourteen times."
NABRE,32,1,3,"[16] Tarshish: identified by many with Tartessus, an ancient Phoenician colony in southwest Spain; precise identification with any particular Phoenician center in the western Mediterranean is uncertain. To the Israelites it stood for the far west."
NABRE,32,1,14,"[17] Aware that this disaster is a divine punishment on Jonah, the sailors ask that in ridding themselves of him they not be charged with the crime of murder."
NABRE,32,2,3,"[1] 2:3-10 These verses, which may have originally been an independent composition, are a typical example of a song of thanksgiving, a common psalm genre (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/19/116/1'>PS 116</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/38/9'>ISA 38:9-20</a>). Such a song is relevant here, since Jonah has not drowned, and the imagery of vv. <a href='/NABRE/32/2/4'>4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/32/2/6'>6</a> is appropriate."
NABRE,32,2,3,[2] Sheol: cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/19/6/6'>PS 6:6</a>.
NABRE,32,3,5,[1] Great and small: the contrast can refer to distinctions of social class (prominent citizens and the poor).
NABRE,32,3,7,"[2] 3:7-8 Fasting and wearing sackcloth are signs of human repentance; here they are legislated even for the animals—a humorous touch, perhaps anticipating <a href='/NABRE/32/4/11'>4:11</a>."
NABRE,32,3,9,"[3] 3:9-10 Scripture frequently presents the Lord as repenting (or, changing his mind) of the evil that he threatens; e.g., <a href='/NABRE/1/6/6'>GEN 6:6-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/18/8'>JER 18:8</a>."
NABRE,32,4,1,"[1] He became angry: because of his narrow vindictiveness, Jonah did not wish the Lord to forgive the Ninevites."
NABRE,32,4,2,"[2] Punishment: lit., ""evil""; see <a href='/NABRE/32/1/2'>1:2, 7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/32/1/8'>8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/32/3/8'>3:8, 10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/32/4/1'>4:1</a>."
NABRE,32,4,4,"[3] The Lords question is as unexpected as it is pithy. It is also a mysterious reply to Jonahs wish to die; perhaps it serves to invite Jonah to think over his situation. However, it goes unanswered, and the request and reply will be repeated in vv. <a href='/NABRE/32/4/8'>8-9</a>."
NABRE,32,4,5,[4] Waited: Jonah still hopes his threat of doom will be fulfilled.
NABRE,32,4,6,"[5] Gourd plant: the Hebrew word, qiqayon, means here a wide-leafed plant of the cucumber or castor-bean variety."
NABRE,32,4,10,"[6] Concerned: the meaning of the Hebrew verb suggests ""pity, care for,"" and this appears in the Lords attitude to Nineveh in v. <a href='/NABRE/32/4/11'>11</a>. Jonah has shown only a selfish concern over the plant in contrast to the Lords true ""concern"" for his creatures."
NABRE,32,4,11,"[7] A selfish Jonah bemoans his personal loss of a gourd plant for shade without any concern over the threat of loss of life to the Ninevites through the destruction of their city. If a solicitous God provided the plant for a prophet without the latters effort or merit, how much more is God disposed to show love and mercy toward all people, Jew and Gentile, when they repent of their sins and implore divine pardon. Gods care goes beyond human beings to all creation, as in <a href='/NABRE/18/38/1'>JOB 38</a>."
NABRE,33,1,2,"[1] The prophet summons all the peoples to hear the divine accusations against them. What follows in <a href='/NABRE/33/1/2'>1:2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/33/3/12'>3:12</a> is a series of prophecies of punishment addressed to the capital cities of both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms, Samaria and Jerusalem. The prophecies indict the leaders and main officials, including prophets. Because of the corruption and selfishness of their leaders, Samaria and Jerusalem will fall to their enemies."
NABRE,33,1,3,[2] The Lord comes in a theophany which has devastating effects on the natural world (<a href='/NABRE/33/1/4'>1:4</a>).
NABRE,33,1,5,"[3] Although the summons (<a href='/NABRE/33/1/2'>1:2</a>) had been addressed to all people, the Lord speaks against Israel and Judah, identifying their crimes with the respective capital cities of Samaria and Jerusalem. Only Samaria, however, is scheduled for destruction in the announcement of punishment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/1/6'>6-7</a>)."
NABRE,33,1,6,[4] The punishment of Samaria will be a military disaster such as the one that actually came at the hands of the Assyrian army in 722/721 B.C.
NABRE,33,1,7,"[5] The wages of a prostitute: as often in the prophets, prostitution is a metaphor for idolatry (<a href='/NABRE/28/1/1'>HOS 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/28/3/1'>3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/4/14'>4:14</a>). They shall return: i.e., Samarias idols shall come to nothing just as the wages of a prostitute are counted as nothing."
NABRE,33,1,8,"[6] 1:8-16 The prophet laments and wails, singing a funeral song or dirge over the city of Jerusalem. Finally (<a href='/NABRE/33/1/16'>1:16</a>) he calls upon the people of Jerusalem to join in the mourning."
NABRE,33,1,10,"[7] 1:10-15 Not all of the cities and villages in this long list can be located with certainty. However, those which can be identified, including the prophets hometown, lie southwest of Jerusalem. In the Hebrew, wordplays on the names of these cities abound. The territory involved corresponds to that decimated by the Assyrian king Sennacherib in 701 B.C., during the reign of Hezekiah. Do not weep at all: some commentators and translators understand the Hebrew differently. They argue that the translation ""in (unknown place name) weep!"" fits the context better."
NABRE,33,1,14,"[8] The houses of Achzib: there is a wordplay here. In the Hebrew, the word translated here as ""dry stream bed"" is achzab; this word is sometimes translated as ""deception"" or ""disappointment."""
NABRE,33,1,16,[9] Shaving the head was a sign of mourning; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/3/24'>ISA 3:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/8/10'>AMO 8:10</a>.
NABRE,33,2,1,"[1] 2:1-5 The cry ""Ah"" (hoy) begins a typical prophetic speech that is usually continued, as here (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/2/1'>1-2</a>), by a description of the addressees in terms of their unrighteous activities. This description is an indictment which gives the reasons for punishment announced to a particular group of people (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/2/3'>3-5</a>). The prophet spells out the crimes; the Lord announces the punishment, which corresponds to the crime: those who take the land of others will have their own land taken. Those who plot iniquity and have the power to do it are wealthy landowners. The evil which they do consists in coveting the fields and houses of others and taking them."
NABRE,33,2,2,"[2] To covet the ""house"" and other property of the neighbor was a violation of the Decalogue (<a href='/NABRE/2/20/17'>EXO 20:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/34/24'>34:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/5/21'>DEU 5:21</a>). The Lord, as owner of the earth, allotted the land by tribes and families to the people of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/6/13/1'>JOS 13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/19/1'>19</a>). Losing ones inheritance diminished ones place in the community and threatened the familys economic viability and existence. According to Micah, those who used their power to expand their estates at the expense of weaker Israelites took more than land from them: they were tampering with the divine order."
NABRE,33,2,4,[3] Those who take land from the less powerful will in turn have their land taken away by invaders.
NABRE,33,2,6,"[4] 2:6-11 This unit is a disputation, an argument in which the prophet is debating with his opponents. The words of the opponents are given to us only as the prophet quotes them. The opponents accuse Micah of being a false prophet, and he reacts by accusing them of injustice and of preferring prophets and preachers who speak lies (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/2/11'>11</a>)."
NABRE,33,2,10,[5] The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
NABRE,33,2,12,"[6] 2:12-13 This announcement of salvation to the ""remnant of Israel"" stands out dramatically in the context, and is probably a later addition to the words of Micah, coming from the time of the Babylonian exile. The content of the promise and the images are similar to those found in Second Isaiah, the great poet of Israels salvation and restoration (see <a href='/NABRE/23/40/11'>ISA 40:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/5'>43:5</a>)."
NABRE,33,3,1,"[1] 3:1-4 This prophecy of punishment has an introductory call to hear (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/1'>1a</a>-b) and two major parts, the indictment or reasons for punishment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/1'>1c</a>-3) and the announcement of judgment (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/4'>4</a>). The prophet accuses the leaders and rulers of Israel of treating the people so badly that their actions are comparable to cannibalism. Those who, above all, should know and maintain justice are the most corrupt of all. In the time of trouble the Lord will withdraw (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/4'>4</a>); that is, God will abandon the leaders to their fate and refuse to answer their prayers."
NABRE,33,3,5,"[2] 3:5-8 This prophecy of punishment concerns and is addressed to false prophets. The prophets in Jerusalem who mislead the people are corrupt because their word can be bought (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/5'>5</a>). Therefore such prophets, seers, and diviners shall be disgraced, put to shame, left in the dark without vision or answer (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/6'>6-7</a>). But Micah is convinced that he is filled with power and the spirit of the Lord, which corresponds to justice and might (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/8'>8</a>)."
NABRE,33,3,9,"[3] 3:9-12 This is the most comprehensive of Micahs prophecies of punishment concerning the leaders in Jerusalem. The indictment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/9'>9-11</a>) includes all political and religious leaders. They combine corruption and greed with a false confidence that the Lord is on their side. But the announcement of judgment (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/3/12'>12</a>) is not limited to the punishment of the leaders but includes Mount Zion where the Temple stands and the entire city, thus encompassing the entire population."
NABRE,33,4,1,"[1] 4:1-4 This magnificent prophecy of salvation is almost identical to <a href='/NABRE/23/2/2'>ISA 2:2-5</a>, with the exception of its last verse. See also <a href='/NABRE/29/4/9'>JOE 4:9-10</a>, which transforms the promise into a call to war. It is not known if Micah or an editor of the book picked up the announcement from his contemporary Isaiah or if Isaiah borrowed it from Micah. Perhaps both Isaiah and Micah depended upon another, more ancient tradition. The ground of the prophetic hope voiced here is the justice and grace of the God who has chosen Israel. The basis for peace shall be a just order where all are obedient to the divine will. While the vision is a universal one, including all peoples and nations (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/4/3'>3-4</a>), its center and wellspring is the Temple of the Lord of Israel on Mount Zion in Jerusalem."
NABRE,33,4,6,[2] 4:6-8 An announcement of salvation proclaiming that the Lord will restore the lame and afflicted people of God as a nation on Mount Zion. Oracle of the Lord: a phrase used extensively in prophetic books to indicate divine speech.
NABRE,33,4,8,"[3] Tower of the flock: in Hebrew migdal-eder,a place name in <a href='/NABRE/1/35/21'>GEN 35:21</a>."
NABRE,33,4,10,"[4] Frequently the prophets personify the city of Jerusalem as a woman, and here as a woman in labor."
NABRE,33,4,11,[5] 4:11-13 The nations who have ridiculed Zion (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/4/11'>11</a>) will be threshed like grain (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/4/13'>13</a>).
NABRE,33,4,13,"[6] Devote their spoils to the Lord: the fulfillment of the ancient ordinance of the holy war in which all plunder taken in the war was ""put under the ban,"" i.e., belonged to the Lord."
NABRE,33,4,14,"[7] Grieve, O grieving daughter!: the Hebrew actually reflects the ancient Near Eastern mourning practice of afflicting oneself with cuts and gashes, as evidence of grief. A literal rendering would be ""gash yourself, O woman who gashes."""
NABRE,33,5,1,"[1] 5:1-6 Salvation will come through a ""messiah,"" an anointed ruler. The Book of Micah shares with Isaiah the expectation that God will deliver Israel through a king in the line of David. Bethlehem-Ephrathah is the home of the Davidic line."
NABRE,33,5,2,"[2] These words are sometimes understood as a reference to Isaiahs Emmanuel oracle, given some thirty years earlier (<a href='/NABRE/23/7/14'>ISA 7:14</a>). The Gospel of Matthew reports that the chief priests and scribes cite this passage as the ancient promise of a messiah in the line of David to be born in Bethlehem (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/5'>MAT 2:5-6</a>)."
NABRE,33,5,4,[3] Peace: he will not only symbolize but also bring about harmony and wholeness.
NABRE,33,5,5,[4] Nimrod: the legendary ancestor of the Mesopotamians; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/10/10'>GEN 10:10-12</a>.
NABRE,33,5,9,"[5] 5:9-13 The Lord will destroy all those features of the nations life that have stood between the people and their God. These false supports include horses, chariots, fortifications, and forbidden practices such as sorcery and idolatry."
NABRE,33,5,12,[6] 5:12-13 Sacred stones…asherahs: the Hebrew asherahis a sacred pole. All forms of idolatry (standing stones and sacred poles were part of forbidden cult practices) were violations of Israels covenant with the Lord.
NABRE,33,6,1,"[1] 6:1-5 The Lord, through the prophet, initiates a legal case against the people. The initial calls (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/1'>1-2</a>) signal the beginning of a trial, and the proclamation that the Lord intends to enter into a legal dispute with Israel. One would expect accusations to follow such an introduction, but instead the Lord speaks in self-defense, reciting mighty acts done in behalf of Israel (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/3'>3-5</a>)."
NABRE,33,6,5,"[2] The Lord calls for the people to remember the saving events of the past, from the encounters with Balak and Balaam (<a href='/NABRE/4/22/23'>NUM 22:23</a>) during the wandering in the wilderness to the entrance into the promised land (""from Shittim to Gilgal,"" <a href='/NABRE/6/3/1'>JOS 3</a>-<a href='/NABRE/6/5/1'>5</a>)."
NABRE,33,6,6,"[3] 6:6-8 These verses continue the previous unit (<a href='/NABRE/33/6/1'>6:1-5</a>), the dialogue between the Lord and the people in the pattern of a trial. The Lord has initiated proceedings against them, and they ask how to re-establish the broken relationship with God (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/6'>6-7</a>), and are given an answer (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/8'>8</a>). The form of the passage borrows from a priestly liturgical pattern. When worshipers came to the temple, they inquired of the priest concerning the appropriate offering or sacrifice, and the priest answered them (see <a href='/NABRE/19/15/1'>PS 15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/24/1'>24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/1/10'>ISA 1:10-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/5/21'>AMO 5:21-24</a>)."
NABRE,33,6,7,"[4] The questions reach their climax with the possibility of child sacrifice, a practice known in antiquity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/16/3'>2KG 16:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/21/6'>21:6</a>)."
NABRE,33,6,8,[5] To do justicerefers to human behavior in relationship to others. To love goodnessrefers to the kind of love and concern which is at the heart of the covenant between the Lord and Israel; it is persistently faithful. To walk humbly with your Godmeans to listen carefully to the revealed will of God.
NABRE,33,6,9,"[6] 6:9-16 The language of the trial resumes as the Lord accuses the people of their sins (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/9'>9-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/33/6/16'>16</a>a) and announces their punishment (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/13'>13-15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/33/6/16'>16</a>b). The city is Jerusalem, and those addressed are its inhabitants. Their wickedness includes cheating in business with false weights and measures, violence, lies, and following the practices of the Israelite kings Omri and Ahab (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/16'>16a</a>), whose reigns came to symbolize a time of syncretistic worship. The punishment, which has already begun, will include a series of disasters. Finally, the Lord will destroy the city and see that its inhabitants are ridiculed (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/6/16'>16b</a>)."
NABRE,33,6,10,[7] Ephah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,33,7,8,"[1] 7:8-20 The book concludes with a collection of confident prayers for deliverance, affirmations of faith, and announcements of salvation. Most of these verses bear the marks of use in worship, and probably arose in the exilic or postexilic periods."
NABRE,33,7,8,"[2] 7:8-10 An individual, possibly personified Jerusalem, expresses confidence that the Lord will deliver her from her enemy (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/23/1'>PS 23</a>)."
NABRE,33,7,10,"[3] She who said…she will be trampled: in the Old Testament, cities are often personified as women. Here, the prophet is speaking of the enemies cities."
NABRE,33,7,11,"[4] 7:11-13 An announcement of salvation to Zion. The walls of Jerusalem will be rebuilt, its inhabitants who are now scattered from Assyria to Egypt shall return, but the other peoples will suffer for their evil deeds."
NABRE,33,7,14,[5] 7:14-17 A prayer that God will care for the people as in ancient days (v. <a href='/NABRE/33/7/14'>14</a>) is answered (vv. <a href='/NABRE/33/7/15'>15-17</a>) when the Lord promises to do marvelous things. The nations shall be afraid and turn to the Lord.
NABRE,33,7,18,"[6] 7:18-20 The final lines of the book contain a hymn of praise for the incomparable God, who pardons sin and delights in mercy. Thus the remnant, those left after the exile, is confident in Gods compassion and in the ancient promises sworn to the ancestors."
NABRE,34,1,1,"[1] Oracle: (Heb. Massa) a word used frequently to describe a prophetic statement against a foreign nation or occasionally Israel; it is used favorably for Israel in <a href='/NABRE/38/12/1'>ZEC 12:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/39/1/1'>MAL 1:1</a>. Nahum of Elkosh: Nahum means ""comfort."" Elkosh is a clan or village of unknown location, perhaps in southern Judah."

NABRE,34,1,11,"[8] From you…giving sinister counsel: addressed to Nineveh, the capital city of Sennacherib, king of Assyria, who besieged Jerusalem ca. 700 B.C."
NABRE,34,1,12,[9] 1:12-13 They: the enemies of Judah. You: Judah. His yoke: the dominion of the Assyrian king over Judah.
NABRE,34,1,14,[10] You: the king of Assyria.
NABRE,34,2,1,"[1] For never again will destroyers invade you: prophets are not always absolutely accurate in the things they foresee. Nineveh was destroyed, as Nahum expected, but Judah was later invaded by the Babylonians and (much later) by the Romans. The prophets were convinced that Israel held a key place in Gods plan and looked for the people to survive all catastrophes, always blessed by the Lord, though the manner was not always as they expected; the ""fallen hut of David"" was not rebuilt as <a href='/NABRE/30/9/11'>AMO 9:11</a> suggests, except in the coming of Jesus, and in a way far different than the prophet expected. Often the prophet speaks in hyperbole, as when Second Isaiah speaks of the restored Jerusalem being built with precious stones (<a href='/NABRE/23/54/12'>ISA 54:12</a>) as a way of indicating a glorious future."
NABRE,34,2,2,"[2] One who scatters has come up against you: the enemy is about to crush Nineveh, dispersing and deporting its people (v. <a href='/NABRE/34/2/8'>8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/34/3/18'>3:18</a>)."
NABRE,34,2,3,"[3] This verse does not fit its context well; it may have been the conclusion for the preceding section and have once followed v. <a href='/NABRE/34/2/1'>1</a>, or it may be a later scribal addition."
NABRE,34,2,6,"[4] Their screen: that is, a mantelet, a movable military shelter protecting the besiegers."
NABRE,34,2,7,[5] River gates: a network of canals brought water into Nineveh from the Tigris and Khosr Rivers on which the city was located.

NABRE,34,3,12,[4] Early figs: the refugees from Nineveh who escape to presumably secure fortresses.
NABRE,34,3,14,[5] An ironic exhortation to prepare the city for a futile defense. Go down…brick mold: make bricks for the city walls.
NABRE,34,3,16,[6] Traders: agents of the economic exploitation that sustained and enriched the Assyrian empire.
NABRE,35,1,2,"[1] 1:2-4 The prophet complains about Gods apparent disregard for Judahs internal evils in language that echoes the preaching of prophets like Amos, Isaiah, and Jeremiah."
NABRE,35,1,4,"[2] The law is numb: because the Lord has been silent, the Law, whether in the form of the scroll found in the Temple in the time of Josiah (<a href='/NABRE/12/22/1'>2KG 22</a>) or in the form of divine instruction given by priests and prophets, has proved ineffective and so appeared to be cold, unreceptive, and powerless. For the Law to be credible, the Lord must see to it that the wicked are punished and the just rewarded."
NABRE,35,1,5,[3] 1:5-7 Habakkuk interprets the Babylonian defeat of Egypt at Carchemish (605 B.C.) as the answer to his complaint: the Lord will send the Chaldean empire against Judah as punishment for their sins.
NABRE,35,1,11,"[4] The primary aim of military campaigns by ancient Near Eastern rulers was usually the gathering of spoils and the collection of tribute rather than the annexation of territory. However, in the eighth century B.C., the Assyrians began to administer many conquered territories as provinces."
NABRE,35,1,12,"[5] 1:12-2:1 Appointed them for judgment: this complaint is directed against the violent Babylonians, the very nation God chose to punish Judah."

NABRE,35,2,2,"[1] Write down the vision: the vision is written down for two reasons: so that a herald may carry and proclaim its contents to the people, and so that the reception of the vision and its truth can be verified by its fulfillment (v. <a href='/NABRE/35/2/3'>3</a>)."
NABRE,35,2,4,[2] The just one who is righteous because of faith shall live: the faithful survive the impending doom because they trust in Gods justice and wait patiently for God to carry it out. Several New Testament passages cite these words (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/17'>ROM 1:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/11'>GAL 3:11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/10/38'>HEB 10:38</a>) to confirm the teaching that people receive justification and supernatural life through faith in Christ.
NABRE,35,2,5,"[3] This verse describes any tyrant who, like the Babylonians, possesses insatiable greed."
NABRE,35,2,7,"[4] Debtors: the Hebrew term can mean either debtors or creditors, and this double meaning is likely intended: the debtor nations rise up against their creditor nation and become its creditors in the reversal of affairs described here."
NABRE,35,2,11,"[5] 2:11-12 The palaces, built at the expense of gross injustice (vv. <a href='/NABRE/35/2/6'>6-10</a>), call down vengeance on their builders. This is typical prophetic language for the condemnation of social crimes within Israel and Judah."
NABRE,35,2,13,[6] Peoples toil: those oppressed by the Babylonians do not benefit from their work. Verses 13-14 break the pattern of reversal in the oracles that precede and may have been added by an editor.
NABRE,35,2,17,"[7] The violence done to Lebanon: the destruction of the cedar forests of Lebanon, used in lavish building projects by the great conquerors; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/14/8'>ISA 14:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/37/24'>37:24</a>. The destruction of the animals: the killing off of the wild animals through excessive hunting by the same conquerors; cf. <a href='/NABRE/73/3/16'>BAR 3:16</a>."
NABRE,35,2,18,"[8] 2:18-20 Idolatrous worship is here shown to be folly by contrasting idols with the majesty of the one true God. Verse 18 may originally have followed v. <a href='/NABRE/35/2/19'>19</a>, since the term ""Ah!"" begins each new saying in this section."
NABRE,35,3,1,"[1] Shigyonot: a Hebrew technical term no longer understood, but probably a musical notation regarding the following hymn. This term, the references to the leader and stringed instruments at the end of the hymn (v. <a href='/NABRE/35/3/19'>19</a>), and the use of the term selahin vv. <a href='/NABRE/35/3/3'>3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/35/3/9'>9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/35/3/13'>13</a> are found elsewhere in the Bible only in the Psalter, and they indicate that, like the psalms, this poem was once used in worship."

NABRE,35,3,8,"[8] Rivers…sea: the forces of chaos personified as yam(Sea) and nahar(River) try to destroy the order God imposed at creation by sweeping past their boundaries and covering the earth. Their mention here and in v. <a href='/NABRE/35/3/15'>15</a> emphasizes that God is both creator and deliverer, subduing historical enemies and cosmic forces."
NABRE,35,3,10,"[9] 3:10-11 Sun…moon: heavenly figures who, like pestilence and plague (v. <a href='/NABRE/35/3/5'>5</a>), serve in Gods army, or are startled at Gods appearance, as are the ancient constellations (v. <a href='/NABRE/35/3/6'>6</a>)."
NABRE,35,3,13,"[10] Your anointed one: the theocratic king, the head of Gods people. The back of the wicked: this may refer both to Gods cosmic enemy, River/Sea, and to the leader of Israels historical enemy."
NABRE,35,3,14,[11] The last two lines of this verse are obscure in Hebrew and difficult to translate.
NABRE,35,3,19,"[12] The heights: this term can also mean ""backs"" and may be an image of conquest over the poets foes."
NABRE,36,1,1,"[1] Hezekiah: it is possible, but not certain, that Zephaniahs ancestor was King Hezekiah who reigned in Judah from 715 to 687 B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/12/18/1'>2KG 18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/12/20/1'>20</a>)."
NABRE,36,1,5,"[2] The host of heaven: the sun, moon, planets, and stars, the worship of which became widespread in Judah under Assyrian influence. Milcom: the god of the Ammonites; cf. <a href='/NABRE/11/11/5'>1KG 11:5, 7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/11/33'>33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/23/13'>2KG 23:13</a>."
NABRE,36,1,7,"[3] He has consecrated his guests: God has consecrated the troops, presumably foreign, who have been invited to share in the spoil on the day of slaughter."
NABRE,36,1,9,[4] Leap over the threshold: the reference may be to a religious ritual like that practiced by the priests of the Philistine deity Dagon (<a href='/NABRE/9/5/5'>1SM 5:5</a>).
NABRE,36,1,10,[5] 1:10-11 The Second Quarter…Maktesh: sections of Jerusalem (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/22/14'>2KG 22:14</a>).
NABRE,36,1,12,"[6] Settle like dregs in wine: those who are overconfident because, like the sediment that settles to the bottom of a bottle of wine, they have remained at peace and undisturbed for a long time."
NABRE,36,2,1,"[1] 2:1-3 This oracle is a classic description of the day of the Lord as an overwhelming disaster, concluding with a call for repentance and reform. Nation without shame: Judah."
NABRE,36,2,4,[2] Gaza…Ashkelon…Ashdod…Ekron: cities of the Philistine confederation.
NABRE,36,2,5,"[3] Cherethites: a synonym for, or subgroup of, the Philistines, which may be associated with Crete, a part of the larger Aegean area from which the Philistines came."
NABRE,36,2,8,[4] Moab…Ammonites: Judahs neighbors to the East across the Jordan.
NABRE,36,2,12,"[5] Cushites: the Ethiopians, who had ruled Egypt a generation before Zephaniahs career."
NABRE,36,2,15,"[6] The exultant city: Nineveh. Hiss, and shake their fists: gestures of derision."
NABRE,36,3,1,[1] The tyrannical city: Jerusalem.
NABRE,37,1,1,"[1] First day of the sixth month in the second year: August 29, 520 B.C. This is the first of six chronological indicators in Haggai. Darius: Darius I, emperor of Persia from 522 to 486 B.C. Governor: term used for local rulers of provinces in the Persian imperial structure. Zerubbabel: grandson of King Jehoiachin (cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/24/8'>2KG 24:8-17</a>)."
NABRE,37,1,4,[2] Your paneled houses…house lies in ruins: the contrast here is between the unfinished Temple and the completed houses of the Judeans.
NABRE,37,1,5,[3] Reflect on your experience: the prophet exhorts the people to consider the futility of their efforts as a result of their neglecting work on the Temple. The following verses call attention to harsh conditions in Judah after the return from exile and the preoccupation of the people with their personal concerns.
NABRE,37,1,8,"[4] That I may be glorified: for the prophet, the rebuilding of the Temple restores the glory God had lost in the eyes of the nations by the Temples destruction."
NABRE,37,1,9,[5] Oracle of the Lord: a phrase used extensively in prophetic books to indicate divine speech.
NABRE,37,1,11,"[6] Devastating heat: this pronouncement of natural disaster, which functions as a warning to the people for their failure to rebuild the Temple, concludes the opening oracular section of Haggai."
NABRE,37,1,12,"[7] The remnant of the people: here the phrase appears to refer to the prophets audience, but the ""remnant"" theme, though often in different Hebrew terminology, suggesting especially those whom the Lord will call back from exile and re-establish as his people, is important in the prophets (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/4/3'>ISA 4:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/37/31'>37:31-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/3/5'>JOE 3:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/4/7'>MIC 4:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/31/1/17'>OBA 1:17</a>) and in the New Testament (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/11/1'>ROM 11:1-10</a>)."
NABRE,37,1,15,"[8] Twenty-fourth day of the sixth month in the second year: September 21, 520 B.C. The resumption of work on the Temple occurred twenty-three days from the beginning of Haggais prophecy. This date formula repeats in reverse order the formula of v. <a href='/NABRE/37/1/1'>1</a>, thereby bringing to conclusion chap. <a href='/NABRE/37/1/1'>1</a>; it also initiates the next unit in <a href='/NABRE/37/2/1'>2:1</a>."
NABRE,37,2,1,"[1] Twenty-first day of the seventh month: October 17, 520 B.C."
NABRE,37,2,3,"[2] Who is left among you: i.e., who is old enough to have seen the first Temple prior to its destruction in 587 B.C.? Compare the reaction of priests who were alive then (<a href='/NABRE/15/3/12'>EZR 3:12-13</a>)."
NABRE,37,2,6,"[3] 2:6-9 These verses emphasize that the total fulfillment of Gods promises to Israel is on the horizon. Such an eschatological event, which will shake the nations (v. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/6'>6</a>; cf. v. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/21'>21</a>), finds an echo not only in the political revolts in the Persian empire in 521 but also in the formative events of Israels history (<a href='/NABRE/2/19/18'>EXO 19:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/5/4'>JUG 5:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/68/8'>PS 68:8-9</a>) when God intervened on behalf of the Israelites. The bringing of treasures of all the nations (v. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/7'>7</a>) to Jerusalem recalls the visionary passages of Isaiah of the pilgrimage of all nations to Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/23/2/2'>ISA 2:2-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/6'>60:6-9</a>)."
NABRE,37,2,9,"[4] Peace: after Gods presence or glory has returned to the Temple, Jerusalem will receive the treasures from the nations, making the Temple more glorious than ever; and from that place God will extend shalom, a peace which embraces prosperity, well-being, harmony."
NABRE,37,2,9,[5] 2:10-14 A request for a priestly ruling (Heb. torah) is made in the form of a dialogue between Haggai and the priests. Explicit examples where such priestly rulings are quoted are rare in prophetic books. The interchange illustrates an essential role of the priesthood: the interpretation of Gods law (cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/10/9'>LEV 10:9-11</a>).
NABRE,37,2,10,"[6] Twenty-fourth day of the ninth month in the second year: December 18, 520 B.C."
NABRE,37,2,11,"[7] Ask the priests for a ruling: i.e., a determination on whether defilement and sanctity can be physically transmitted. The priests are expected to make a legal decision. The answer is that sanctity cannot be transmitted (v. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/12'>12</a>) but defilement can (v. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/13'>13</a>). Priestly duties are enumerated in <a href='/NABRE/3/10/10'>LEV 10:10-20</a>."
NABRE,37,2,14,[8] So is this people: the prophets interpretation is that the restored sacrifices were not acceptable because the peoples behavior was tainted.
NABRE,37,2,15,"[9] 2:15-19 This prophecy is retrospective and should be read with <a href='/NABRE/37/1/5'>1:5-11</a>, a description of the conditions of economic deprivation before the rebuilding of the Temple."
NABRE,37,2,16,[10] Ephahs: see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>.
NABRE,37,2,18,"[11] Twenty-fourth day of the ninth month: December 18, 520 B.C., the date of the refounding of the Temple (vv. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/10'>10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/37/2/20'>20</a>), the central date in Haggai."
NABRE,37,2,19,"[12] I will bless you: from the day of the refounding of the Temple, agricultural plenty and fertility are assured. This link between temple and prosperity is part of the ancient Near Eastern temple ideology that underlies Haggai and <a href='/NABRE/38/1/1'>ZEC 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/38/8/1'>8</a>."
NABRE,37,2,19,"[13] 2:20-23 This final oracle of hope is uttered on the day of the refounding of the Temple. Unlike the other oracles it is addressed to Zerubbabel alone, who, as a Davidic descendant, will have a servant role in Gods future Israelite kingdom to be established when God intervenes to overthrow the nations."
NABRE,37,2,20,"[14] Twenty-fourth day of the month: December 18, 520 B.C. (as in v. <a href='/NABRE/37/2/18'>18</a>)."
NABRE,37,2,23,"[15] Like a signet ring: this promise to Zerubbabel reverses the punishment of his grandfather (<a href='/NABRE/24/22/23'>JER 22:23-25</a>). A signet is a ring or other instrument used to mark documents or materials with the equivalent of an official signature. A lower official could thus be authorized to act on behalf of a higher official. Like a signet ring, Zerubbabel represents the Lord."
NABRE,38,1,1,"[1] Darius: Darius I, emperor of Persia from 522 to 486 B.C. The second year…eighth month: October/November 520 B.C., i.e., prior to the latest date in Haggai (Dec. 18, 520 B.C., <a href='/NABRE/37/2/10'>HAG 2:10</a>). Unlike other prophets, Haggai and Zechariah 1-8 contain specific chronological information, probably because they were sensitive to the imminent end of the expected seventy years of exile. See note on <a href='/NABRE/38/1/12'>ZEC 1:12</a>."
NABRE,38,1,2,"[2] Your ancestors: refers to the preexilic people of Judah, who were subjected to Babylonian destruction and exile."
NABRE,38,1,3,[3] Oracle of the Lord: a phrase used extensively in prophetic books to indicate divine speech.
NABRE,38,1,4,"[4] Earlier prophets: preexilic prophets of the Lord. There are many allusions to them in Zechariah, indicating their influence on the postexilic community (see <a href='/NABRE/38/7/7'>7:7, 12</a>)."
NABRE,38,1,6,"[5] Repented: the Hebrew word shubliterally means ""turn back."" This term is often used to speak of repentance as a return to the covenantal relationship between Israel and the Lord."
NABRE,38,1,7,"[6] The second year…eleventh month: February 15, 519 B.C. The largest set of visions (<a href='/NABRE/38/1/7'>1:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/38/6/15'>6:15</a>) is dated to a time just prior to the beginning of the new year in the spring."
NABRE,38,1,8,"[7] 1:8-11 Four riders on horses of three different colors are sent by God to patrol the four corners of the earth. Compare the four chariots of the seventh vision, 6:1-8."
NABRE,38,1,8,"[8] In the night: nighttime, or this night. This setting of darkness is meant only for the first vision."
NABRE,38,1,9,"[9] My lord: this expression in Hebrew (adoni) is used as a polite form of address. Angel who spoke with me: angelic being (not identical to the angel of the Lord who is one of the four horsemen) who serves as an interpreter, bringing a message from God to the prophet, who himself is a messenger of God."
NABRE,38,1,11,"[10] Angel of the Lord: chief angelic figure in Gods heavenly court, and perhaps the ""man"" of <a href='/NABRE/38/1/8'>1:8</a>."
NABRE,38,1,12,"[11] These seventy years: allusion to the period of divine anger mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/24/25/11'>JER 25:11-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/29/10'>29:10</a>. Here the symbolic number seventy is understood to mark the period without a Temple in Jerusalem. Since these seventy years would have been almost over at this point, this symbolic number would have provided motivation for rebuilding the Temple as a sign of the end of the exile."
NABRE,38,1,14,"[12] For Jerusalem and for Zion: rather than the usual order, Zion and Jerusalem, elsewhere in the Bible. The reversal highlights the centrality of Jerusalem, which is mentioned in all three of the brief oracles of <a href='/NABRE/38/1/14'>1:14-17</a>."
NABRE,38,1,15,"[13] Complacent nations: probably a reference to the Persian empire, which in its imperial extent included many national groups that maintained separate identities. Compounded the disaster: the surrounding nations took advantage of the Lords anger against Judah to further their own interests."
NABRE,38,1,16,"[14] My house: the Temple. See note on <a href='/NABRE/37/1/4'>HAG 1:4</a>. Measuring line: a builders string, not for devastation, as in <a href='/NABRE/23/34/11'>ISA 34:11</a>, but for reconstruction."
NABRE,38,2,1,"[1] Four horns: symbols of the total political and military might of Judahs imperial adversaries, probably representing Assyria, Babylonia, and Persia. The number four represents universality rather than any specific number of foes."
NABRE,38,2,2,[2] Scattered: sent part of the population into exile. This was standard imperial policy initiated in the ancient Near East by the Assyrians for dealing with a conquered state.
NABRE,38,2,3,"[3] Four workmen: four agents of Gods power. The imagery follows that of four horns: the workers cut down, or make ineffectual, the horns, i.e., enemy."
NABRE,38,2,5,"[4] Measuring cord: a string for measuring, as opposed to a builders string, 1:16."
NABRE,38,2,8,[5] That official: probably the man with the measuring cord of v. <a href='/NABRE/38/2/5'>5</a>.
NABRE,38,2,9,"[6] Encircling wall of fire: divine protection for an unwalled Jerusalem. Urban centers were generally walled, and Jerusalems walls were eventually rebuilt in the late fifth century B.C. (<a href='/NABRE/16/2/17'>NEH 2:17-20</a>)."
NABRE,38,2,10,"[7] Land of the north: refers to Babylon (v. <a href='/NABRE/38/2/11'>11</a>), in a geographic rather than a political sense, as the place from which exiles will return. The designation is ""north"" because imperial invaders historically entered Palestine from that direction (see <a href='/NABRE/24/3/18'>JER 3:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/23/8'>23:8</a>)."
NABRE,38,2,15,[8] Many nations…my people: a way of expressing Gods relationship to people in covenant language. The covenant between God and Israel (see <a href='/NABRE/24/31/33'>JER 31:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/32/38'>32:38</a>) is here universalized to include all nations.
NABRE,38,2,16,"[9] The holy land: the Lords earthly territory, a designation found only rarely in the Old Testament."
NABRE,38,3,1,"[1] Adversary: Hebrew satan, here, the prosecuting attorney, a figure in the Lords heavenly courtroom. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/18/1/6'>JOB 1:6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/18/2/7'>2:7</a>. Later tradition understands this figure to be Satan."
NABRE,38,3,3,[2] 3:3-4 The filthy garments of Joshua symbolized the guilt of the Israelite people who have become unclean by going into exile. The angel of the Lord purifies the high priest by the removal of his garments.
NABRE,38,3,7,"[3] If you walk…watch over my courts: four components of priestly activity: (1) following Gods commandments and teaching them to the people, (2) carrying out cultic functions, (3) participating in the judicial system in certain difficult cases, and (4) administering the laborers and lands in the Temples domain."
NABRE,38,3,8,"[4] Signs of things to come: the restoration of the priesthood is a sign of the expected restoration of the Davidic line. The Branch: a tree metaphor for the expected future ruler as a descendant of the Davidic dynasty. This imagery also appears in <a href='/NABRE/23/11/1'>ISA 11:1, 10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/23/5'>JER 23:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/33/15'>33:15</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/38/6/12'>ZEC 6:12</a>."
NABRE,38,3,9,"[5] Stone with seven facets: represents both the precious stones that were part of the high priests apparel and the building stone (see <a href='/NABRE/38/4/7'>4:7, 10</a>) that initiated a major construction project. The seven facets (or ""eyes"") indicate the totality of its role as an instrument of Gods vigilance and action. Inscription: can refer both to words engraved on the high priests apparel (<a href='/NABRE/2/28/9'>EXO 28:9, 11</a>) and to words chiseled on a cornerstone."
NABRE,38,4,2,"[1] Lampstand: receptacle for lamps and one of the furnishings of the main room of the Temple. This visionary object does not correspond to the biblical descriptions of the menorah in either the tabernacle (<a href='/NABRE/2/25/31'>EXO 25:31-40</a>) or the Solomonic Temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/49'>1KG 7:49</a>) but rather has properties of both. Seven lamps…seven spouts: seven lamps, each with seven pinched wick holes. Such objects were part of the repertoire of cultic vessels throughout the Old Testament period. Here they symbolize Gods eyes, i.e., divine omniscience; see v. <a href='/NABRE/38/4/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,38,4,3,"[2] Olive trees: visionary image that picks up the botanical language describing the Israelite cultic lampstands, with the olive trees specifically connoting fertility, permanence, and righteousness."
NABRE,38,4,6,"[3] Not by might…my spirit: one of the most quoted verses from the Old Testament, particularly in Jewish tradition, which connects it with the theme of Hanukkah, sometimes called the Festival of Lights."
NABRE,38,4,7,"[4] Great mountain: part of symbolic imagery for the Temple on Mount Zion, as embodiment of the cosmic mountain where heaven and earth connect. Plain: leveled ground serving as the foundation area for the construction of the Temple, and symbolizing the foundation of the cosmos. First stone: foundation stone of a major public building. Such stones were laid with great ceremony in foundation rituals when monumental buildings were newly built or rebuilt in the biblical world."
NABRE,38,4,10,"[5] Capstone: topmost stone of a structure, which finishes the construction. This translation is based on the context. Other translations read: ""stone of distinction,"" ""plummet,"" ""tin-stone."""
NABRE,38,4,14,[6] Two anointed ones: two leadership positions in the ideal restored nation. The concept of a state headed by both priestly and political leaders harks back to premonarchic traditions (Aaron and Moses) and finds an echo in the two messianic figures—a Davidic and a levitical messiah—in the Dead Sea Scrolls and in apocryphal literature. See also the two crowns of <a href='/NABRE/38/6/11'>6:11-14</a>.
NABRE,38,5,2,"[1] Twenty cubits long and ten cubits wide: ca. thirty feet by fifteen feet. These dimensions may represent the ratio of height to width in the exposed portion of a scroll being opened for liturgical reading; at the same time it may symbolize the approach to Gods presence since the entryway to the Temple has the same measurements (<a href='/NABRE/11/6/3'>1KG 6:3</a>). The scroll itself may represent Gods covenant with the people, insofar as it contains curses against those who break the law."
NABRE,38,5,3,[2] Thief…perjurer: a pair of miscreants representing all those who disobey Gods covenant (see note on v. <a href='/NABRE/38/5/2'>2</a>) and who must therefore be punished according to covenant curses.
NABRE,38,5,6,"[3] Basket: literally, ephah, a dry measure; see note on <a href='/NABRE/23/5/10'>ISA 5:10</a>."
NABRE,38,5,7,"[4] Woman sitting inside the basket: figure representing wickedness or foreign idolatry being transported back to Babylonia (vv. <a href='/NABRE/38/5/1'>1-11</a>). Returning exiles were apparently worshiping deities they had learned to accept in Babylonia, and that ""wickedness"" (v. <a href='/NABRE/38/5/8'>8</a>) must be removed."
NABRE,38,5,9,"[5] Two women…wings: composite beings, part human and part animal, similar to the cherubim flanking the holy ark (<a href='/NABRE/2/25/18'>EXO 25:18-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/6/23'>1KG 6:23-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/10/18'>EZE 10:18-22</a>). Such creatures accompany foreign deities as here, or the biblical God."
NABRE,38,5,11,[6] Shinar: land of Babylonia; this name for Babylonia is found also in <a href='/NABRE/1/1/10'>GEN 1:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/11/2'>11:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/14/1'>14:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/11/11'>ISA 11:11</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/27/1/2'>DAN 1:2</a>.
NABRE,38,6,1,[1] Four chariots: vehicles with horses of four different colors (vv. <a href='/NABRE/38/6/2'>2-3</a>) represent Gods presence throughout the world and correspond to the four horses of <a href='/NABRE/38/1/7'>1:7-11</a>.
NABRE,38,6,5,[2] Four winds of the heavens: four compass directions and therefore the whole world.
NABRE,38,6,8,[3] Land of the north: the enemy (cf. <a href='/NABRE/38/2/10'>2:10</a>). This emphasis on the land of the north refers to the fact that God will deal with Israels foes and order will be re-established.
NABRE,38,6,11,"[4] Crowns: two crowns made of precious metals and representing two high offices (compare the symbolism of the two olive trees in <a href='/NABRE/38/4/14'>4:14</a>). One crown is for the high priest Joshua, who, with the governor Zerubbabel, was one of the recognized rulers of the Persian province of Judah. The other crown would have been for a royal ruler, a Davidic descendant. Zerubbabel was a Davidide but could not be king because the Persians would not allow such autonomy. The second crown was thus put in storage in the Temple (v. <a href='/NABRE/38/6/14'>14</a>) for the crowning of a future king, or ""branch"" (see <a href='/NABRE/38/3/8'>3:8</a>), from the house of David."
NABRE,38,6,12,[5] Branch: future Davidic ruler. See note on <a href='/NABRE/38/3/8'>3:8</a>.
NABRE,38,6,13,[6] Peaceful understanding: harmonious rule of both the high priest and the king.
NABRE,38,7,1,"[1] The fourth year of Darius…the ninth month, Kislev: December 7, 518 B.C., the last chronological heading in Zechariah."
NABRE,38,7,3,[2] Weep…fifth month: a mourning ritual commemorating the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple on the seventh day of the fifth month in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzars reign (ca. 587/586 B.C.; see <a href='/NABRE/12/25/8'>2KG 25:8</a>).
NABRE,38,7,5,"[3] Seventh month: the time of a fast in memory of the murder of Gedaliah, the governor installed by the Babylonians after they conquered Jerusalem (see <a href='/NABRE/12/25/25'>2KG 25:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/41/1'>JER 41:1-3</a>). Seventy years: see note on <a href='/NABRE/38/1/12'>1:12</a>."
NABRE,38,7,7,"[4] 7:7, 12 Earlier prophets: see note on <a href='/NABRE/38/1/4'>1:4</a>."
NABRE,38,7,10,[5] Widow…orphan…resident alien…poor: four categories of socially and economically marginalized persons. Concern for their well-being is commanded in both pentateuchal and prophetic literature.
NABRE,38,8,3,"[1] Faithful city: a unique biblical epithet for Jerusalem, signaling the importance of the holy city and its leaders for establishing justice in society (see also vv. <a href='/NABRE/38/8/8'>8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/38/8/16'>16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/38/8/19'>19</a>). Holy mountain: Jerusalem and its Temple, the sacred center of the holy land (<a href='/NABRE/38/2/16'>2:16</a>) and of the whole world."
NABRE,38,8,9,"[2] When the foundation…was laid: December 18, 520 B.C., the date of the Temple refoundation ceremony, marking the beginning of the project to restore the Temple (see <a href='/NABRE/37/2/10'>HAG 2:10, 18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/37/2/20'>20</a>)."
NABRE,38,8,12,"[3] Vine…land…heavens: future prosperity, reversing the hardships of <a href='/NABRE/37/1/10'>HAG 1:10</a>."

NABRE,38,9,1,"[1] 9:1-8 The opening verses of Second Zechariah delineate the ideal boundaries of a restored Israel. Echoing the ideas of Haggai and First Zechariah (chaps. <a href='/NABRE/38/1/1'>1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/38/8/1'>8</a>), the prophet reiterates the notion that the rebuilt Temple will bring about peace.

NABRE,38,11,3,"[1] 11:4-17 This narrative has features of an allegory, a parable, and a commissioning narrative.

For example, the staff ""Delight"" signifies the Mosaic covenant, and the staff ""Union"" signifies the union of Israel and Judah. Breaking the staffs signifies the breaking of the Mosaic covenant (resulting in the destruction of Jerusalem and the exile) and the historical schism between north and south. In this narrative the prophet is the ""shepherd"" of Gods flock, which is to be slaughtered. The ""three shepherds"" of v. <a href='/NABRE/38/11/8'>8</a> represent either leaders responsible for the decay in Israelite society or false prophets (cf. vv. <a href='/NABRE/38/11/15'>15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/38/11/17'>17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/13/2'>13:2-6</a>). The service of the good shepherd is contemptuously valued at thirty pieces of silver, the legal indemnity for a gored slave (<a href='/NABRE/2/21/32'>EXO 21:32</a>). The prophet throws the money into the Temple treasury, showing how poorly Gods love is requited (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/26/14'>MAT 26:14-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/27/5'>27:5</a>). With great rhetorical irony, payment is rejected. The entire wage-payment scenario may be regarded as another symbolic action, embedded within the primary action."

NABRE,38,12,11,"[5] The mourning for the pierced victim in Jerusalem is compared to the annual ritual mourning in the plain of Megiddo over the death of the Phoenician fertility god, Hadadrimmon.

NABRE,39,1,10,"[4] 1:10-11 The imperfect sacrifices offered by the people of Judah are displeasing to the Lord. Kindling fire on my altar: kindle the altar fire for sacrifice. In contrast, the Lord is pleased with the sacrifices offered by other peoples in other places (the rising of the sun: the far east; its setting: the far west). Since the people of other nations could not be expected to know the Lords name as did the people of Judah, the rhetorical purpose of this statement is to shame the latter. Incense offerings: in the ancient world, the hallmark of an offering made to a god was the smoke it produced on an altar. In the Old Testament, this was true not only of animals (<a href='/NABRE/3/8/20'>LEV 8:20-21</a>) but also of incense (<a href='/NABRE/2/30/7'>EXO 30:7</a>), suet (<a href='/NABRE/3/3/11'>LEV 3:11</a>), and grain offerings (<a href='/NABRE/3/6/8'>LEV 6:8</a>).

Foreign marriages are here portrayed as a covenantal violation (v. <a href='/NABRE/39/2/10'>10</a>). They were all the more reprehensible when they were accompanied by the divorce of Israelite wives (vv. <a href='/NABRE/39/2/14'>14-16</a>), and God finds their sacrifices unacceptable (vv. <a href='/NABRE/39/2/13'>13-14</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/41/10/2'>MAK 10:2-12</a>, Jesus forbids divorce; in <a href='/NABRE/40/19/3'>MAT 19:3-12</a>, this ideal is maintained with the provision that unlawful marriage may be grounds for divorce (see <a href='/NABRE/46/7/10'>1CO 7:10-16</a>).

NABRE,40,1,1,"[1] 1:1-2:23 The infancy narrative forms the prologue of the gospel. Consisting of a genealogy and five stories, it presents the coming of Jesus as the climax of Israels history, and the events of his conception, birth, and early childhood as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. The genealogy is probably traditional material that Matthew edited. In its first two sections (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/2'>MAT 1:2-11</a>) it was drawn from <a href='/NABRE/8/4/18'>RUT 4:18-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/13/1/1'>1CH 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/13/3/1'>3</a>. Except for Jechoniah, Shealtiel, and Zerubbabel, none of the names in the third section (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/12'>MAT 1:12-16</a>) is found in any Old Testament genealogy. While the genealogy shows the continuity of Gods providential plan from Abraham on, discontinuity is also present. The women Tamar (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/3'>MAT 1:3</a>), Rahab and Ruth (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/5'>MAT 1:5</a>), and the wife of Uriah, Bathsheba (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/6'>MAT 1:6</a>), bore their sons through unions that were in varying degrees strange and unexpected. These ""irregularities"" culminate in the supreme ""irregularity"" of the Messiahs birth of a virgin mother; the age of fulfillment is inaugurated by a creative act of God. Drawing upon both biblical tradition and Jewish stories, Matthew portrays Jesus as reliving the Exodus experience of Israel and the persecutions of Moses. His rejection by his own people and his passion are foreshadowed by the troubled reaction of ""all Jerusalem"" to the question of the magi who are seeking the ""newborn king of the Jews"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/2'>MAT 2:2-3</a>), and by Herods attempt to have him killed. The magi who do him homage prefigure the Gentiles who will accept the preaching of the gospel. The infancy narrative proclaims who Jesus is, the savior of his people from their sins (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/21'>MAT 1:21</a>), Emmanuel in whom ""God is with us"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/23'>MAT 1:23</a>), and the Son of God (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/15'>MAT 2:15</a>)."
NABRE,40,1,1,"[2] The Son of David, the son of Abraham: two links of the genealogical chain are singled out. Although the later, David is placed first in order to emphasize that Jesus is the royal Messiah. The mention of Abraham may be due not only to his being the father of the nation Israel but to Matthews interest in the universal scope of Jesus mission; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/18'>GEN 22:18</a> ""…in your descendants all the nations of the earth shall find blessing."""
NABRE,40,1,7,"[3] The successor of Abijah was not Asaph but Asa (see <a href='/NABRE/13/3/10'>1CH 3:10</a>). Some textual witnesses read the latter name; however, Asaphis better attested. Matthew may have deliberately introduced the psalmist Asaph into the genealogy (and in <a href='/NABRE/40/1/10'>MAT 1:10</a> the prophet Amos) in order to show that Jesus is the fulfillment not only of the promises made to David (see <a href='/NABRE/10/7/1'>2SM 7</a>) but of all the Old Testament."
NABRE,40,1,10,"[4] Amos: some textual witnesses read Amon, who was the actual successor of Manasseh (see <a href='/NABRE/13/3/14'>1CH 3:14</a>)."
NABRE,40,1,17,"[5] Matthew is concerned with fourteen generations, probably because fourteen is the numerical value of the Hebrew letters forming the name of David. In the second section of the genealogy (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/6'>MAT 1:6</a>b-11), three kings of Judah, Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, have been omitted (see <a href='/NABRE/13/3/11'>1CH 3:11-12</a>), so that there are fourteen generations in that section. Yet the third (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/12'>MAT 1:12-16</a>) apparently has only thirteen. Since Matthew here emphasizes that each section has fourteen, it is unlikely that the thirteen of the last was due to his oversight. Some scholars suggest that Jesus who is called the Messiah(<a href='/NABRE/40/1/16'>MAT 1:16</a>b) doubles the final member of the chain: Jesus, born within the family of David, opens up the new age as Messiah, so that in fact there are fourteen generations in the third section. This is perhaps too subtle, and the hypothesis of a slip not on the part of Matthew but of a later scribe seems likely. On Messiah, see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>LUK 2:11</a>."
NABRE,40,1,17,[6] 1:18-25 This first story of the infancy narrative spells out what is summarily indicated in <a href='/NABRE/40/1/16'>MAT 1:16</a>. The virginal conception of Jesus is the work of the Spirit of God. Josephs decision to divorce Mary is overcome by the heavenly command that he take her into his home and accept the child as his own. The natural genealogical line is broken but the promises to David are fulfilled; through Josephs adoption the child belongs to the family of David. Matthew sees the virginal conception as the fulfillment of <a href='/NABRE/23/7/14'>ISA 7:14</a>.
NABRE,40,1,18,"[7] Betrothed to Joseph: betrothal was the first part of the marriage, constituting a man and woman as husband and wife. Subsequent infidelity was considered adultery. The betrothal was followed some months later by the husbands taking his wife into his home, at which time normal married life began."
NABRE,40,1,19,"[8] A righteous man: as a devout observer of the Mosaic law, Joseph wished to break his union with someone whom he suspected of gross violation of the law. It is commonly said that the law required him to do so, but the texts usually given in support of that view, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/5/22/20'>DEU 22:20-21</a> do not clearly pertain to Josephs situation. Unwilling to expose her to shame: the penalty for proved adultery was death by stoning; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/22/21'>DEU 22:21-23</a>."
NABRE,40,1,20,"[9] The angel of the Lord: in the Old Testament a common designation of God in communication with a human being. In a dream: see <a href='/NABRE/40/2/13'>MAT 2:13, 19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/2/22'>22</a>. These dreams may be meant to recall the dreams of Joseph, son of Jacob the patriarch (<a href='/NABRE/1/37/5'>GEN 37:5-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/37/19'>19</a>). A closer parallel is the dream of Amram, father of Moses, related by Josephus (Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/40/2/212'>2:212</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/2/215'>215-16</a>)."
NABRE,40,1,21,"[10] Jesus: in first-century Judaism the Hebrew name Joshua (Greek Iēsous) meaning ""Yahweh helps"" was interpreted as ""Yahweh saves."""
NABRE,40,1,23,"[11] God is with us: Gods promise of deliverance to Judah in Isaiahs time is seen by Matthew as fulfilled in the birth of Jesus, in whom God is with his people. The name Emmanuel is alluded to at the end of the gospel where the risen Jesus assures his disciples of his continued presence, ""…I am with you always, until the end of the age"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/20'>MAT 28:20</a>)."
NABRE,40,1,25,"[12] Until she bore a son: the evangelist is concerned to emphasize that Joseph was not responsible for the conception of Jesus. The Greek word translated ""until"" does not imply normal marital conduct after Jesus birth, nor does it exclude it."
NABRE,40,2,1,[1] 2:1-12 The future rejection of Jesus by Israel and his acceptance by the Gentiles are retrojected into this scene of the narrative.
NABRE,40,2,1,"[2] In the days of King Herod: Herod reigned from 37 to 4 B.C. Magi: originally a designation of the Persian priestly caste, the word became used of those who were regarded as having more than human knowledge. Matthews magi are astrologers."
NABRE,40,2,2,"[3] We saw his star: it was a common ancient belief that a new star appeared at the time of a rulers birth. Matthew also draws upon the Old Testament story of Balaam, who had prophesied that ""A star shall advance from Jacob"" (<a href='/NABRE/4/24/17'>NUM 24:17</a>), though there the star means not an astral phenomenon but the king himself."
NABRE,40,2,4,"[4] Herods consultation with the chief priests and scribes has some similarity to a Jewish legend about the child Moses in which the ""sacred scribes"" warn Pharaoh about the imminent birth of one who will deliver Israel from Egypt and the king makes plans to destroy him."
NABRE,40,2,11,"[5] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/72/10'>PS 72:10, 15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/6'>ISA 60:6</a>. These Old Testament texts led to the interpretation of the magi as kings."
NABRE,40,2,13,"[6] 2:13-23 Biblical and nonbiblical traditions about Moses are here applied to the child Jesus, though the dominant Old Testament type is not Moses but Israel (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/15'>MAT 2:15</a>)."
NABRE,40,2,13,"[7] Flee to Egypt: Egypt was a traditional place of refuge for those fleeing from danger in Palestine (see <a href='/NABRE/11/11/40'>1KG 11:40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/26/21'>JER 26:21</a>), but the main reason why the child is to be taken to Egypt is that he may relive the Exodus experience of Israel."
NABRE,40,2,15,"[8] The fulfillment citation is taken from <a href='/NABRE/28/11/1'>HOS 11:1</a>. Israel, Gods son, was called out of Egypt at the time of the Exodus; Jesus, the Son of God, will similarly be called out of that land in a new exodus. The father-son relationship between God and the nation is set in a higher key. Here the son is not a group adopted as ""son of God,"" but the child who, as conceived by the holy Spirit, stands in unique relation to God. He is son of David and of Abraham, of Mary and of Joseph, but, above all, of God."
NABRE,40,2,18,"[9] <a href='/NABRE/24/31/15'>JER 31:15</a> portrays Rachel, wife of the patriarch Jacob, weeping for her children taken into exile at the time of the Assyrian invasion of the northern kingdom (722-21 B.C.). Bethlehem was traditionally identified with Ephrath, the place near which Rachel was buried (see <a href='/NABRE/1/35/19'>GEN 35:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/48/7'>48:7</a>), and the mourning of Rachel is here applied to her lost children of a later age. Ramah: about six miles north of Jerusalem. The lamentation of Rachel is so great as to be heard at a far distance."
NABRE,40,2,20,"[10] For those who sought the childs life are dead: Moses, who had fled from Egypt because the Pharaoh sought to kill him (see <a href='/NABRE/2/2/15'>EXO 2:15</a>), was told to return there, ""for all the men who sought your life are dead"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/4/19'>EXO 4:19</a>)."
NABRE,40,2,22,"[11] With the agreement of the emperor Augustus, Archelaus received half of his fathers kingdom, including Judea, after Herods death. He had the title ""ethnarch"" (i.e., ""ruler of a nation"") and reigned from 4 B.C. to A.D. 6."
NABRE,40,2,23,"[12] Nazareth…he shall be called a Nazorean: the tradition of Jesus residence in Nazareth was firmly established, and Matthew sees it as being in accordance with the foreannounced plan of God. The town of Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament, and no such prophecy can be found there. The vague expression ""through the prophets"" may be due to Matthews seeing a connection between Nazareth and certain texts in which there are words with a remote similarity to the name of that town. Some such Old Testament texts are <a href='/NABRE/23/11/1'>ISA 11:1</a> where the Davidic king of the future is called ""a bud"" (nēser) that shall blossom from the roots of Jesse, and <a href='/NABRE/7/13/5'>JUG 13:5, 7</a> where Samson, the future deliverer of Israel from the Philistines, is called one who shall be consecrated (a nāzîr) to God."
NABRE,40,3,1,"[1] 3:1-12 Here Matthew takes up the order of Jesus ministry found in the gospel of Mark, beginning with the preparatory preaching of John the Baptist."
NABRE,40,3,1,"[2] Unlike Luke, Matthew says nothing of the Baptist’s origins and does not make him a relative of Jesus. The desert of Judea: the barren region west of the Dead Sea extending up the Jordan valley."
NABRE,40,3,2,"[3] Repent: the Baptist calls for a change of heart and conduct, a turning of ones life from rebellion to obedience towards God. The kingdom of heaven is at hand: ""heaven"" (lit., ""the heavens"") is a substitute for the name ""God"" that was avoided by devout Jews of the time out of reverence. The expression ""the kingdom of heaven"" occurs only in the gospel of Matthew. It means the effective rule of God over his people. In its fullness it includes not only human obedience to Gods word, but the triumph of God over physical evils, supremely over death. In the expectation found in Jewish apocalyptic, the kingdom was to be ushered in by a judgment in which sinners would be condemned and perish, an expectation shared by the Baptist. This was modified in Christian understanding where the kingdom was seen as being established in stages, culminating with the parousia of Jesus."
NABRE,40,3,3,[4] See note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/23'>JHN 1:23</a>.
NABRE,40,3,4,"[5] The clothing of John recalls the austere dress of the prophet Elijah (<a href='/NABRE/12/1/8'>2KG 1:8</a>). The expectation of the return of Elijah from heaven to prepare Israel for the final manifestation of Gods kingdom was widespread, and according to Matthew this expectation was fulfilled in the Baptists ministry (<a href='/NABRE/40/11/14'>MAT 11:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/17/11'>17:11-13</a>)."
NABRE,40,3,6,[6] Ritual washing was practiced by various groups in Palestine between 150 B.C. and A.D. 250. Johns baptism may have been related to the purificatory washings of the Essenes at Qumran.
NABRE,40,3,7,"[7] Pharisees and Sadducees: the former were marked by devotion to the law, written and oral, and the scribes, experts in the law, belonged predominantly to this group. The Sadducees were the priestly aristocratic party, centered in Jerusalem. They accepted as scripture only the first five books of the Old Testament, followed only the letter of the law, rejected the oral legal traditions, and were opposed to teachings not found in the Pentateuch, such as the resurrection of the dead. Matthew links both of these groups together as enemies of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/1'>MAT 16:1, 6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/16/11'>11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/16/12'>12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/8/11'>MAK 8:11-13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/8/15'>15</a>). The threatening words that follow are addressed to them rather than to ""the crowds"" as in <a href='/NABRE/42/3/7'>LUK 3:7</a>. The coming wrath: the judgment that will bring about the destruction of unrepentant sinners."
NABRE,40,3,11,"[8] Baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire: the water baptism of John will be followed by an ""immersion"" of the repentant in the cleansing power of the Spirit of God, and of the unrepentant in the destroying power of Gods judgment. However, some see the holy Spiritand fireas synonymous, and the effect of this ""baptism"" as either purification or destruction. See note on <a href='/NABRE/42/3/16'>LUK 3:16</a>."
NABRE,40,3,12,"[9] The discrimination between the good and the bad is compared to the procedure by which a farmer separates wheat and chaff. The winnowing fanwas a forklike shovel with which the threshed wheat was thrown into the air. The kernels fell to the ground; the light chaff, blown off by the wind, was gathered and burned up."
NABRE,40,3,12,[10] 3:13-17 The baptism of Jesus is the occasion on which he is equipped for his ministry by the holy Spirit and proclaimed to be the Son of God.
NABRE,40,3,14,"[11] 3:14-15 This dialogue, peculiar to Matthew, reveals Johns awareness of Jesus superiority to him as the mightier one who is coming and who will baptize with the holy Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/11'>MAT 3:11</a>). His reluctance to admit Jesus among the sinners whom he is baptizing with water is overcome by Jesus response. To fulfill all righteousness: in this gospel to fulfillusually refers to fulfillment of prophecy, and righteousnessto moral conduct in conformity with Gods will. Here, however, as in <a href='/NABRE/40/5/6'>MAT 5:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/6/33'>6:33</a>, righteousnessseems to mean the saving activity of God. To fulfill all righteousnessis to submit to the plan of God for the salvation of the human race. This involves Jesus identification with sinners; hence the propriety of his accepting Johns baptism."
NABRE,40,3,16,[12] The Spirit…coming upon him: cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>ISA 42:1</a>.
NABRE,40,3,17,[13] This is my beloved Son: the Marcan address to Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/11'>MAK 1:11</a>) is changed into a proclamation. The Fathers voice speaks in terms that reflect <a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>ISA 42:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/2/7'>PS 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/22/2'>GEN 22:2</a>.
NABRE,40,4,1,"[1] 4:1-11 Jesus, proclaimed Son of God at his baptism, is subjected to a triple temptation. Obedience to the Father is a characteristic of true sonship, and Jesus is tempted by the devil to rebel against God, overtly in the third case, more subtly in the first two. Each refusal of Jesus is expressed in language taken from the Book of Deuteronomy (<a href='/NABRE/5/8/3'>DEU 8:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/6/13'>6:13, 16</a>). The testings of Jesus resemble those of Israel during the wandering in the desert and later in Canaan, and the victory of Jesus, the true Israel and the true Son, contrasts with the failure of the ancient and disobedient ""son,"" the old Israel. In the temptation account Matthew is almost identical with Luke; both seem to have drawn upon the same source."
NABRE,40,4,2,"[2] Forty days and forty nights: the same time as that during which Moses remained on Sinai (<a href='/NABRE/2/24/18'>EXO 24:18</a>). The time reference, however, seems primarily intended to recall the forty years during which Israel was tempted in the desert (<a href='/NABRE/5/8/2'>DEU 8:2</a>)."
NABRE,40,4,4,[3] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/8/3'>DEU 8:3</a>. Jesus refuses to use his power for his own benefit and accepts whatever God wills.
NABRE,40,4,5,"[4] 4:5-7 The devil supports his proposal by an appeal to the scriptures, <a href='/NABRE/19/91/11'>PS 91:11</a>a, 12. Unlike Israel (<a href='/NABRE/5/6/16'>DEU 6:16</a>), Jesus refuses to ""test"" God by demanding from him an extraordinary show of power."
NABRE,40,4,9,[5] The worship of Satan to which Jesus is tempted is probably intended to recall Israels worship of false gods. His refusal is expressed in the words of <a href='/NABRE/5/6/13'>DEU 6:13</a>.
NABRE,40,4,11,"[6] 4:12-17 Isaiahs prophecy of the light rising upon Zebulun and Naphtali (<a href='/NABRE/23/8/22'>ISA 8:22</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/9/1'>9:1</a>) is fulfilled in Jesus residence at Capernaum. The territory of these two tribes was the first to be devastated (733-32 B.C.) at the time of the Assyrian invasion. In order to accommodate Jesus move to Capernaum to the prophecy, Matthew speaks of that town as being ""in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/4/13'>MAT 4:13</a>), whereas it was only in the territory of the latter, and he understands the sea of the prophecy, the Mediterranean, as the sea of Galilee."
NABRE,40,4,17,[7] At the beginning of his preaching Jesus takes up the words of John the Baptist (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>) although with a different meaning; in his ministry the kingdom of heaven has already begun to be present (<a href='/NABRE/40/12/28'>MAT 12:28</a>).
NABRE,40,4,17,"[8] 4:18-22 The call of the first disciples promises them a share in Jesus work and entails abandonment of family and former way of life. Three of the four, Simon, James, and John, are distinguished among the disciples by a closer relation with Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/1'>MAT 17:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/37'>26:37</a>)."
NABRE,40,4,20,"[9] Here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/4/22'>MAT 4:22</a>, as in Mark (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/16'>MAK 1:16-20</a>) and unlike the Lucan account (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/1'>LUK 5:1-11</a>), the disciples response is motivated only by Jesus invitation, an element that emphasizes his mysterious power."
NABRE,40,4,22,"[10] 4:23-25 This summary of Jesus ministry concludes the narrative part of the first book of Matthews gospel (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/1'>MAT 3</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/4/1'>4</a>). The activities of his ministry are teaching, proclaiming the gospel, and healing; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/9/35'>MAT 9:35</a>."
NABRE,40,4,23,"[11] Their synagogues: Matthew usually designates the Jewish synagogues as their synagogue(s)(<a href='/NABRE/40/9/35'>MAT 9:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/10/17'>10:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/12/9'>12:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/13/54'>13:54</a>) or, in address to Jews, your synagogues(<a href='/NABRE/40/23/34'>MAT 23:34</a>), an indication that he wrote after the break between church and synagogue."
NABRE,40,4,24,[12] Syria: the Roman province to which Palestine belonged.
NABRE,40,4,25,"[13] The Decapolis: a federation of Greek cities in Palestine, originally ten in number, all but one east of the Jordan."
NABRE,40,5,1,"[1] 5:1-7:29 The first of the five discourses that are a central part of the structure of this gospel. It is the discourse section of the first book and contains sayings of Jesus derived from Q and from M. The Lucan parallel is in that gospels ""Sermon on the Plain"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-49</a>), although some of the sayings in Matthews ""Sermon on the Mount"" have their parallels in other parts of Luke. The careful topical arrangement of the sermon is probably not due only to Matthews editing; he seems to have had a structured discourse of Jesus as one of his sources. The form of that source may have been as follows: four beatitudes (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/6'>6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/11'>11-12</a>), a section on the new righteousness with illustrations (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/17'>MAT 5:17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/20'>20-24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/27'>27-28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/33'>33-48</a>), a section on good works (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/1'>MAT 6:1-6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/6/16'>16-18</a>), and three warnings (<a href='/NABRE/40/7/1'>MAT 7:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/7/15'>15-21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/7/24'>24-27</a>)."
NABRE,40,5,1,"[2] 5:1-2 Unlike Lukes sermon, this is addressed not only to the disciples but to the crowds (see <a href='/NABRE/40/7/28'>MAT 7:28</a>)."
NABRE,40,5,3,"[3] 5:3-12 The form Blessed are (is)occurs frequently in the Old Testament in the Wisdom literature and in the psalms. Although modified by Matthew, the first, second, fourth, and ninth beatitudes have Lucan parallels (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3</a> || <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/5/4'>MAT 5:4</a> || <a href='/NABRE/42/6/21'>LUK 6:21</a>b; <a href='/NABRE/40/5/6'>MAT 5:6</a> || <a href='/NABRE/42/6/21'>LUK 6:21</a>a; <a href='/NABRE/40/5/11'>MAT 5:11-12</a> || <a href='/NABRE/42/5/22'>LUK 5:22-23</a>). The others were added by the evangelist and are probably his own composition. A few manuscripts, Western and Alexandrian, and many versions and patristic quotations give the second and third beatitudes in inverted order."
NABRE,40,5,3,"[4] The poor in spirit: in the Old Testament, the poor (anāwîm) are those who are without material possessions and whose confidence is in God (see <a href='/NABRE/23/61/1'>ISA 61:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/36/2/3'>ZEP 2:3</a>; in the NAB the word is translated lowlyand humble, respectively, in those texts). Matthew added in spiritin order either to indicate that only the devout poor were meant or to extend the beatitude to all, of whatever social rank, who recognized their complete dependence on God. The same phrase poor in spiritis found in the Qumran literature (1QM 14:7)."
NABRE,40,5,4,"[5] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/61/2'>ISA 61:2</a>, ""(The Lord has sent me)…to comfort all who mourn."" They will be comforted: here the passive is a ""theological passive"" equivalent to the active ""God will comfort them""; so also in <a href='/NABRE/40/5/6'>MAT 5:6, 7</a>."
NABRE,40,5,5,"[6] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/37/11'>PS 37:11</a>, ""…the meek shall possess the land."" In the psalm ""the land"" means the land of Palestine; here it means the kingdom."
NABRE,40,5,6,"[7] For righteousness: a Matthean addition. For the meaning of righteousnesshere, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/14'>MAT 3:14-15</a>."
NABRE,40,5,8,"[8] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/24/4'>PS 24:4</a>. Only one ""whose heart is clean"" can take part in the temple worship. To be with God in the temple is described in <a href='/NABRE/19/42/3'>PS 42:3</a> as ""beholding his face,"" but here the promise to the clean of heartis that they will see Godnot in the temple but in the coming kingdom."
NABRE,40,5,10,"[9] Righteousnesshere, as usually in Matthew, means conduct in conformity with Gods will."
NABRE,40,5,12,[10] The prophets who were before you: the disciples of Jesus stand in the line of the persecuted prophets of Israel. Some would see the expression as indicating also that Matthew considered all Christian disciples as prophets.
NABRE,40,5,12,"[11] 5:13-16 By their deeds the disciples are to influence the world for good. They can no more escape notice than a city set on a mountain. If they fail in good works, they are as useless as flavorless salt or as a lamp whose light is concealed."
NABRE,40,5,13,"[12] The unusual supposition of salt losing its flavor has led some to suppose that the saying refers to the salt of the Dead Sea that, because chemically impure, could lose its taste."
NABRE,40,5,17,"[13] 5:17-20 This statement of Jesus position concerning the Mosaic law is composed of traditional material from Matthews sermon documentation (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>MAT 5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/7/29'>7:29</a>), other Q material (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/18/1'>MAT 18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/17'>LUK 16:17</a>), and the evangelists own editorial touches. To fulfillthe law appears at first to mean a literal enforcement of the law in the least detail: until heaven and earth pass awaynothing of the law will pass(<a href='/NABRE/40/5/18'>MAT 5:18</a>). Yet the ""passing away"" of heaven and earth is not necessarily the end of the world understood, as in much apocalyptic literature, as the dissolution of the existing universe. The ""turning of the ages"" comes with the apocalyptic event of Jesus death and resurrection, and those to whom this gospel is addressed are living in the new and final age, prophesied by Isaiah as the time of ""new heavens and a new earth"" (<a href='/NABRE/23/65/17'>ISA 65:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/66/22'>66:22</a>). Meanwhile, during Jesus ministry when the kingdom is already breaking in, his mission remains within the framework of the law, though with significant anticipation of the age to come, as the following antitheses (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/21'>MAT 5:21-48</a>) show."
NABRE,40,5,19,"[14] Probably these commandmentsmeans those of the Mosaic law. But this is an interim ethic ""until heaven and earth pass away."""
NABRE,40,5,20,"[15] 5:21-48 Six examples of the conduct demanded of the Christian disciple. Each deals with a commandment of the law, introduced by You have heard that it was said to your ancestorsor an equivalent formula, followed by Jesus teaching in respect to that commandment, But I say to you; thus their designation as ""antitheses."" Three of them accept the Mosaic law but extend or deepen it (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/21'>MAT 5:21-22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/27'>27-28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/43'>43-44</a>); three reject it as a standard of conduct for the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/31'>MAT 5:31-32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/33'>33-37</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/38'>38-39</a>)."

NABRE,40,5,22,[17] 5:22-26 Reconciliation with an offended brother is urged in the admonition of <a href='/NABRE/40/5/23'>MAT 5:23-24</a> and the parable of <a href='/NABRE/40/5/25'>MAT 5:25-26</a> (|| <a href='/NABRE/42/12/58'>LUK 12:58-59</a>). The severity of the judge in the parable is a warning of the fate of unrepentant sinners in the coming judgment by God.
NABRE,40,5,22,"[18] Anger is the motive behind murder, as the insulting epithets are steps that may lead to it. They, as well as the deed, are all forbidden. Raqa: an Aramaic word rēqāor rēqâprobably meaning ""imbecile,"" ""blockhead,"" a term of abuse. The ascending order of punishment, judgment(by a local council?), trial before the Sanhedrin, condemnation to Gehenna, points to a higher degree of seriousness in each of the offenses. Sanhedrin: the highest judicial body of Judaism. Gehenna: in Hebrew gê-hinnōm, ""Valley of Hinnom,"" or gê ben-hinnōm, ""Valley of the son of Hinnom,"" southwest of Jerusalem, the center of an idolatrous cult during the monarchy in which children were offered in sacrifice (see <a href='/NABRE/12/23/10'>2KG 23:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/7/31'>JER 7:31</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/6/18/16'>JOS 18:16</a> (Septuagint, Codex Vaticanus) the Hebrew is transliterated into Greek as gaienna, which appears in the New Testament as geenna. The concept of punishment of sinners by fire either after death or after the final judgment is found in Jewish apocalyptic literature (e.g., Enoch <a href='/NABRE/40/90/26'>90:26</a>) but the name geennais first given to the place of punishment in the New Testament."

NABRE,40,5,31,"[21] 5:31-32 See <a href='/NABRE/5/24/1'>DEU 24:1-5</a>. The Old Testament commandment that a bill of divorce be given to the woman assumes the legitimacy of divorce itself. It is this that Jesus denies. (Unless the marriage is unlawful): this ""exceptive clause,"" as it is often called, occurs also in <a href='/NABRE/40/19/9'>MAT 19:9</a>, where the Greek is slightly different. There are other sayings of Jesus about divorce that prohibit it absolutely (see <a href='/NABRE/41/10/11'>MAK 10:11-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/18'>LUK 16:18</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/7/10'>1CO 7:10, 11</a>b), and most scholars agree that they represent the stand of Jesus. Matthews ""exceptive clauses"" are understood by some as a modification of the absolute prohibition. It seems, however, that the unlawfulness that Matthew gives as a reason why a marriage must be broken refers to a situation peculiar to his community: the violation of Mosaic law forbidding marriage between persons of certain blood and/or legal relationship (<a href='/NABRE/3/18/6'>LEV 18:6-18</a>). Marriages of that sort were regarded as incest (porneia), but some rabbis allowed Gentile converts to Judaism who had contracted such marriages to remain in them. Matthews ""exceptive clause"" is against such permissiveness for Gentile converts to Christianity; cf. the similar prohibition of porneiain <a href='/NABRE/44/15/20'>ACT 15:20, 29</a>. In this interpretation, the clause constitutes no exception to the absolute prohibition of divorce when the marriage is lawful."
NABRE,40,5,33,"[22] This is not an exact quotation of any Old Testament text, but see <a href='/NABRE/2/20/7'>EXO 20:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/5/11'>DEU 5:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/19/12'>LEV 19:12</a>. The purpose of an oath was to guarantee truthfulness by ones calling on God as witness."
NABRE,40,5,34,"[23] 5:34-36 The use of these oath formularies that avoid the divine name is in fact equivalent to swearing by it, for all the things sworn by are related to God."
NABRE,40,5,37,"[24] Let your Yes mean Yes, and your No mean No: literally, ""let your speech be Yes, yes, No, no."" Some have understood this as a milder form of oath, permitted by Jesus. In view of <a href='/NABRE/40/5/34'>MAT 5:34</a>, ""Do not swear at all,"" that is unlikely. From the evil one: i.e., from the devil. Oath-taking presupposes a sinful weakness of the human race, namely, the tendency to lie. Jesus demands of his disciples a truthfulness that makes oaths unnecessary."
NABRE,40,5,38,"[25] 5:38-42 See <a href='/NABRE/3/24/20'>LEV 24:20</a>. The Old Testament commandment was meant to moderate vengeance; the punishment should not exceed the injury done. Jesus forbids even this proportionate retaliation. Of the five examples that follow, only the first deals directly with retaliation for evil; the others speak of liberality."
NABRE,40,5,41,[26] Roman garrisons in Palestine had the right to requisition the property and services of the native population.
NABRE,40,5,42,"[27] 5:43-48 See <a href='/NABRE/3/19/18'>LEV 19:18</a>. There is no Old Testament commandment demanding hatred of ones enemy, but the ""neighbor"" of the love commandment was understood as ones fellow countryman. Both in the Old Testament (<a href='/NABRE/19/139/19'>PS 139:19-22</a>) and at Qumran (1QS 9:21) hatred of evil persons is assumed to be right. Jesus extends the love commandment to the enemy and the persecutor. His disciples, as children of God, must imitate the example of their Father, who grants his gifts of sun and rain to both the good and the bad."
NABRE,40,5,46,[28] Tax collectors: Jews who were engaged in the collection of indirect taxes such as tolls and customs. See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/2/14'>MAK 2:14</a>.
NABRE,40,5,47,"[29] Jesus disciples must not be content with merely usual standards of conduct; see <a href='/NABRE/40/5/20'>MAT 5:20</a> where the verb ""surpass"" (Greek perisseuō) is cognate with the unusual(perisson) of this verse."
NABRE,40,5,48,"[30] Perfect: in the gospels this word occurs only in Matthew, here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/19/21'>MAT 19:21</a>. The Lucan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/36'>LUK 6:36</a>) demands that the disciples be merciful."
NABRE,40,6,1,"[1] 6:1-18 The sermon continues with a warning against doing good in order to be seen and gives three examples, almsgiving (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/2'>MAT 6:2-4</a>), prayer (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/5'>MAT 6:5-15</a>), and fasting (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/16'>MAT 6:16-18</a>). In each, the conduct of the hypocrites (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/2'>MAT 6:2</a>) is contrasted with that demanded of the disciples. The sayings about reward found here and elsewhere (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/12'>MAT 5:12, 46</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/10/41'>10:41-42</a>) show that this is a genuine element of Christian moral exhortation. Possibly to underline the difference between the Christian idea of reward and that of the hypocrites, the evangelist uses two different Greek verbs to express the rewarding of the disciples and that of the hypocrites; in the latter case it is the verb apechō, a commercial term for giving a receipt for what has been paid in full (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/2'>MAT 6:2, 5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/6/16'>16</a>)."
NABRE,40,6,2,"[2] The hypocrites: the scribes and Pharisees, see <a href='/NABRE/40/23/13'>MAT 23:13, 15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/23/23'>23</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/23/25'>25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/23/27'>27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/23/29'>29</a>. The designation reflects an attitude resulting not only from the controversies at the time of Jesus ministry but from the opposition between Pharisaic Judaism and the church of Matthew. They have received their reward: they desire praise and have received what they were looking for."
NABRE,40,6,7,"[3] 6:7-15 Matthew inserts into his basic traditional material an expansion of the material on prayer that includes the model prayer, the ""Our Father."" That prayer is found in <a href='/NABRE/42/11/2'>LUK 11:2-4</a> in a different context and in a different form."
NABRE,40,6,7,"[4] The example of what Christian prayer should be like contrasts it now not with the prayer of the hypocrites but with that of the pagans. Their babbling probably means their reciting a long list of divine names, hoping that one of them will force a response from the deity."
NABRE,40,6,9,"[5] 6:9-13 Matthews form of the ""Our Father"" follows the liturgical tradition of his church. Lukes less developed form also represents the liturgical tradition known to him, but it is probably closer than Matthews to the original words of Jesus."
NABRE,40,6,9,"[6] Our Father in heaven: this invocation is found in many rabbinic prayers of the post-New Testament period. Hallowed be your name: though the ""hallowing"" of the divine name could be understood as reverence done to God by human praise and by obedience to his will, this is more probably a petition that God hallow his own name, i.e., that he manifest his glory by an act of power (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/36/23'>EZE 36:23</a>), in this case, by the establishment of his kingdom in its fullness."
NABRE,40,6,10,"[7] Your kingdom come: this petition sets the tone of the prayer, and inclines the balance toward divine rather than human action in the petitions that immediately precede and follow it. Your will be done, on earth as in heaven: a petition that the divine purpose to establish the kingdom, a purpose present now in heaven, be executed on earth."
NABRE,40,6,11,"[8] Give us today our daily bread: the rare Greek word epiousios, here daily, occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href='/NABRE/42/11/3'>LUK 11:3</a>. A single occurrence of the word outside of these texts and of literature dependent on them has been claimed, but the claim is highly doubtful. The word may mean dailyor ""future"" (other meanings have also been proposed). The latter would conform better to the eschatological tone of the whole prayer. So understood, the petition would be for a speedy coming of the kingdom (today), which is often portrayed in both the Old Testament and the New under the image of a feast (<a href='/NABRE/23/25/6'>ISA 25:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/22/1'>22:1-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/13/29'>LUK 13:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/14/15'>14:15-24</a>)."
NABRE,40,6,12,"[9] Forgive us our debts: the word debtsis used metaphorically of sins, ""debts"" owed to God (see <a href='/NABRE/42/11/4'>LUK 11:4</a>). The request is probably for forgiveness at the final judgment."
NABRE,40,6,13,"[10] Jewish apocalyptic writings speak of a period of severe trial before the end of the age, sometimes called the ""messianic woes."" This petition asks that the disciples be spared that final test."
NABRE,40,6,14,"[11] 6:14-15 These verses reflect a set pattern called ""Principles of Holy Law."" Human action now will be met by a corresponding action of God at the final judgment."
NABRE,40,6,16,"[12] The only fast prescribed in the Mosaic law was that of the Day of Atonement (<a href='/NABRE/3/16/31'>LEV 16:31</a>), but the practice of regular fasting was common in later Judaism; cf. Didache <a href='/NABRE/40/9/1'>9:1</a>."
NABRE,40,6,19,"[13] 6:19-34 The remaining material of this chapter is taken almost entirely from Q. It deals principally with worldly possessions, and the controlling thought is summed up in <a href='/NABRE/40/6/24'>MAT 6:24</a>: the disciple can serve only one master and must choose between God and wealth (mammon). See further the note on <a href='/NABRE/42/16/9'>LUK 16:9</a>."
NABRE,40,6,21,[14] 6:22-23 In this context the parable probably points to the need for the disciple to be enlightened by Jesus teaching on the transitory nature of earthly riches.
NABRE,40,6,24,[15] Mammon: an Aramaic word meaning wealth or property.
NABRE,40,6,24,"[16] 6:25-34 Jesus does not deny the reality of human needs (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/32'>MAT 6:32</a>), but forbids making them the object of anxious care and, in effect, becoming their slave."
NABRE,40,6,27,"[17] Life-span: the Greek word can also mean ""stature."" If it is taken in that sense, the word here translated moment(literally, ""cubit"") must be translated literally as a unit not of time but of spatial measure. The cubit is about eighteen inches."
NABRE,40,6,30,"[18] Of little faith: except for the parallel in <a href='/NABRE/42/12/28'>LUK 12:28</a>, the word translated of little faithis found in the New Testament only in Matthew. It is used by him of those who are disciples of Jesus but whose faith in him is not as deep as it should be (see <a href='/NABRE/40/8/26'>MAT 8:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/14/31'>14:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/16/8'>16:8</a> and the cognate noun in <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>)."
NABRE,40,6,33,[19] Righteousness: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/14'>MAT 3:14-15</a>.
NABRE,40,7,1,"[1] 7:1-12 In <a href='/NABRE/40/7/1'>MAT 7:1</a> Matthew returns to the basic traditional material of the sermon (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/37'>LUK 6:37-38</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/6/41'>41-42</a>). The governing thought is the correspondence between conduct toward ones fellows and Gods conduct toward the one so acting."
NABRE,40,7,1,"[2] This is not a prohibition against recognizing the faults of others, which would be hardly compatible with <a href='/NABRE/40/7/5'>MAT 7:5, 6</a> but against passing judgment in a spirit of arrogance, forgetful of ones own faults."
NABRE,40,7,5,[3] Hypocrite: the designation previously given to the scribes and Pharisees is here given to the Christian disciple who is concerned with the faults of another and ignores his own more serious offenses.
NABRE,40,7,6,"[4] Dogsand swinewere Jewish terms of contempt for Gentiles. This saying may originally have derived from a Jewish Christian community opposed to preaching the gospel (what is holy, pearls) to Gentiles. In the light of <a href='/NABRE/40/28/19'>MAT 28:19</a> that can hardly be Matthews meaning. He may have taken the saying as applying to a Christian dealing with an obstinately impenitent fellow Christian (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/17'>MAT 18:17</a>)."
NABRE,40,7,9,[5] 7:9-10 There is a resemblance between a stone and a round loaf of bread and between a serpent and the scaleless fish called barbut.
NABRE,40,7,12,"[6] See <a href='/NABRE/42/6/31'>LUK 6:31</a>. This saying, known since the eighteenth century as the ""Golden Rule,"" is found in both positive and negative form in pagan and Jewish sources, both earlier and later than the gospel. This is the law and the prophetsis an addition probably due to the evangelist."
NABRE,40,7,13,"[7] 7:13-28 The final section of the discourse is composed of a series of antitheses, contrasting two kinds of life within the Christian community, that of those who obey the words of Jesus and that of those who do not. Most of the sayings are from Q and are found also in Luke."
NABRE,40,7,13,"[8] 7:13-14 The metaphor of the ""two ways"" was common in pagan philosophy and in the Old Testament. In Christian literature it is found also in the Didache(1-6) and the Epistle of Barnabas(18-20)."
NABRE,40,7,14,"[9] 7:15-20 Christian disciples who claimed to speak in the name of God are called prophets(<a href='/NABRE/40/7/15'>MAT 7:15</a>) in <a href='/NABRE/40/10/41'>MAT 10:41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/23/34'>MAT 23:34</a>. They were presumably an important group within the church of Matthew. As in the case of the Old Testament prophets, there were both true and false ones, and for Matthew the difference could be recognized by the quality of their deeds, the fruits(<a href='/NABRE/40/7/16'>MAT 7:16</a>). The mention of fruitsleads to the comparison with trees, some producing good fruit, others bad."
NABRE,40,7,21,"[10] 7:21-23 The attack on the false prophets is continued, but is broadened to include those disciples who perform works of healing and exorcism in the name of Jesus (Lord) but live evil lives. Entrance into the kingdom is only for those who do the will of the Father. On the day of judgment (on that day) the morally corrupt prophets and miracle workers will be rejected by Jesus."
NABRE,40,7,23,"[11] I never knew you: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/10/33'>MAT 10:33</a>. Depart from me, you evildoers: cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/6/9'>PS 6:9</a>."
NABRE,40,7,24,"[12] 7:24-27 The conclusion of the discourse (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/6/47'>LUK 6:47-49</a>). Here the relation is not between saying and doing as in <a href='/NABRE/40/7/15'>MAT 7:15-23</a> but between hearing and doing, and the words of Jesus are applied to every Christian (everyone who listens)."
NABRE,40,7,28,[13] 7:28-29 When Jesus finished these words: this or a similar formula is used by Matthew to conclude each of the five great discourses of Jesus (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/11/1'>MAT 11:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/13/53'>13:53</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/19/1'>19:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/1'>26:1</a>).
NABRE,40,7,29,"[14] Not as their scribes: scribal instruction was a faithful handing down of the traditions of earlier teachers; Jesus teaching is based on his own authority. Their scribes: for the implications of their, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/4/23'>MAT 4:23</a>."
NABRE,40,8,1,"[1] 8:1-9:38 This narrative section of the second book of the gospel is composed of nine miracle stories, most of which are found in Mark, although Matthew does not follow the Marcan order and abbreviates the stories radically. The stories are arranged in three groups of three, each group followed by a section composed principally of sayings of Jesus about discipleship. <a href='/NABRE/40/9/35'>MAT 9:35</a> is an almost verbatim repetition of <a href='/NABRE/40/4/23'>MAT 4:23</a>. Each speaks of Jesus teaching, preaching, and healing. The teaching and preaching form the content of <a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>MAT 5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/7/1'>7</a>; the healing, that of <a href='/NABRE/40/8/1'>MAT 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/9/1'>9</a>. Some scholars speak of a portrayal of Jesus as ""Messiah of the Word"" in <a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>MAT 5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/7/1'>7</a> and ""Messiah of the Deed"" in <a href='/NABRE/40/8/1'>MAT 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/9/1'>9</a>. That is accurate so far as it goes, but there is also a strong emphasis on discipleship in <a href='/NABRE/40/8/1'>MAT 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/9/1'>9</a>; these chapters have not only christological but ecclesiological import."
NABRE,40,8,2,[2] A leper: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/1/40'>MAK 1:40</a>.
NABRE,40,8,4,"[3] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/14/2'>LEV 14:2-9</a>. That will be proof for them: the Greek can also mean ""that will be proof against them."" It is not clear whether themrefers to the priests or the people."
NABRE,40,8,4,"[4] 8:5-13 This story comes from Q (see <a href='/NABRE/42/7/1'>LUK 7:1-10</a>) and is also reflected in <a href='/NABRE/43/4/46'>JHN 4:46-54</a>. The similarity between the Q story and the Johannine is due to a common oral tradition, not to a common literary source. As in the later story of the daughter of the Canaanite woman (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/21'>MAT 15:21-28</a>) Jesus here breaks with his usual procedure of ministering only to Israelites and anticipates the mission to the Gentiles."
NABRE,40,8,5,"[5] A centurion: a military officer commanding a hundred men. He was probably in the service of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/14/1'>MAT 14:1</a>."
NABRE,40,8,8,"[6] 8:8-9 Acquainted by his position with the force of a command, the centurion expresses faith in the power of Jesus mere word."
NABRE,40,8,10,"[7] In no one in Israel: there is good textual attestation (e.g., Codex Sinaiticus) for a reading identical with that of <a href='/NABRE/42/7/9'>LUK 7:9</a>, ""not even in Israel."" But that seems to be due to a harmonization of Matthew with Luke."
NABRE,40,8,11,"[8] 8:11-12 Matthew inserts into the story a Q saying (see <a href='/NABRE/42/13/28'>LUK 13:28-29</a>) about the entrance of Gentiles into the kingdom and the exclusion of those Israelites who, though descended from the patriarchs and members of the chosen nation (the children of the kingdom), refused to believe in Jesus. There will be wailing and grinding of teeth: the first occurrence of a phrase used frequently in this gospel to describe final condemnation (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/42'>MAT 13:42, 50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/22/13'>22:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/51'>24:51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/25/30'>25:30</a>). It is found elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href='/NABRE/42/13/28'>LUK 13:28</a>."
NABRE,40,8,13,"[9] 8:14-15 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/1/29'>MAK 1:29-31</a>. Unlike Mark, Matthew has no implied request by others for the womans cure. Jesus acts on his own initiative, and the cured woman rises and waits not on ""them"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/31'>MAK 1:31</a>) but on him."
NABRE,40,8,16,[10] By a word: a Matthean addition to <a href='/NABRE/41/1/34'>MAK 1:34</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/8/8'>8:8</a>.
NABRE,40,8,17,"[11] This fulfillment citation from <a href='/NABRE/23/53/4'>ISA 53:4</a> follows the MT, not the LXX. The prophet speaks of the Servant of the Lord who suffers vicariously for the sins (""infirmities"") of others; Matthew takes the infirmitiesas physical afflictions."
NABRE,40,8,17,[12] 8:18-22 This passage between the first and second series of miracles about following Jesus is taken from Q (see <a href='/NABRE/42/9/57'>LUK 9:57-62</a>). The third of the three sayings found in the source is absent from Matthew.
NABRE,40,8,18,"[13] The other side: i.e., of the Sea of Galilee."
NABRE,40,8,19,"[14] Teacher: for Matthew, this designation of Jesus is true, for he has Jesus using it of himself (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/24'>MAT 10:24, 25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/23/8'>23:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/18'>26:18</a>), yet when it is used of him by others they are either his opponents (<a href='/NABRE/40/9/11'>MAT 9:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/12/38'>12:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/17/24'>17:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/22/16'>22:16, 24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/22/36'>36</a>) or, as here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/19/16'>MAT 19:16</a>, well-disposed persons who cannot see more deeply. Thus it reveals an inadequate recognition of who Jesus is."
NABRE,40,8,20,"[15] Son of Man: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31</a>. This is the first occurrence in Matthew of a term that appears in the New Testament only in sayings of Jesus, except for <a href='/NABRE/44/7/56'>ACT 7:56</a> and possibly <a href='/NABRE/40/9/6'>MAT 9:6</a> (|| <a href='/NABRE/41/2/10'>MAK 2:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/5/24'>LUK 5:24</a>). In Matthew it refers to Jesus in his ministry (seven times, as here), in his passion and resurrection (nine times, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/40/17/22'>MAT 17:22</a>), and in his glorious coming at the end of the age (thirteen times, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/40/24/30'>MAT 24:30</a>)."
NABRE,40,8,22,[16] Let the dead bury their dead: the demand of Jesus overrides what both the Jewish and the Hellenistic world regarded as a filial obligation of the highest importance. See note on <a href='/NABRE/42/9/60'>LUK 9:60</a>.
NABRE,40,8,23,"[17] His disciples followed him: the first miracle in the second group (<a href='/NABRE/40/8/23'>MAT 8:23</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/9/8'>9:8</a>) is introduced by a verse that links it with the preceding sayings by the catchword ""follow."" In Mark the initiative in entering the boat is taken by the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/35'>MAK 4:35-41</a>); here, Jesus enters first and the disciples follow."
NABRE,40,8,24,"[18] Storm: literally, ""earthquake,"" a word commonly used in apocalyptic literature for the shaking of the old world when God brings in his kingdom. All the synoptics use it in depicting the events preceding the parousia of the Son of Man (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/7'>MAT 24:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/13/8'>MAK 13:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/21/11'>LUK 21:11</a>). Matthew has introduced it here and in his account of the death and resurrection of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/51'>MAT 27:51-54</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/28/2'>28:2</a>)."
NABRE,40,8,25,[19] The reverent plea of the disciples contrasts sharply with their reproach of Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/41/4/38'>MAK 4:38</a>.
NABRE,40,8,26,[20] You of little faith: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/6/30'>MAT 6:30</a>.

NABRE,40,8,28,"[21] Gadarenes: this is the reading of Codex Vaticanus, supported by other important textual witnesses. The original reading of Codex Sinaiticus was Gazarenes, later changed to Gergesenes, and a few versions have Gerasenes. Each of these readings points to a different territory connected, respectively, with the cities Gadara, Gergesa, and Gerasa (modern Jerash). There is the same confusion of readings in the parallel texts, <a href='/NABRE/41/5/1'>MAK 5:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/42/8/26'>LUK 8:26</a>; there the best reading seems to be ""Gerasenes,"" whereas ""Gadarenes"" is probably the original reading in Matthew. The town of Gadara was about five miles southeast of the Sea of Galilee, and Josephus (Life <a href='/NABRE/40/9/42'>9:42</a>) refers to it as possessing territory that lay on that sea. Two demoniacs: Mark (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>5:1-20</a>) has one."
NABRE,40,8,29,[22] What have you to do with us?: see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/2/4'>JHN 2:4</a>. Before the appointed time: the notion that evil spirits were allowed by God to afflict human beings until the time of the final judgment is found in Enoch <a href='/NABRE/40/16/1'>16:1</a> and Jubilees <a href='/NABRE/40/10/7'>10:7-10</a>.
NABRE,40,8,30,"[23] The tending of pigs, animals considered unclean by Mosaic law (<a href='/NABRE/3/11/6'>LEV 11:6-7</a>), indicates that the population was Gentile."

NABRE,40,9,3,"[2] Scribes: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/2/6'>MAK 2:6</a>. Matthew omits the reason given in the Marcan story for the charge of blasphemy: ""Who but God alone can forgive sins?"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/2/7'>MAK 2:7</a>)."
NABRE,40,9,6,"[3] It is not clear whether But that you may know…to forgive sinsis intended to be a continuation of the words of Jesus or a parenthetical comment of the evangelist to those who would hear or read this gospel. In any case, Matthew here follows the Marcan text."
NABRE,40,9,8,"[4] Who had given such authority to human beings: a significant difference from <a href='/NABRE/41/2/12'>MAK 2:12</a> (""They…glorified God, saying, We have never seen anything like this""). Matthews extension to human beingsof the authority to forgive sins points to the belief that such authority was being claimed by Matthews church."
NABRE,40,9,8,[5] 9:9-17 In this section the order is the same as that of <a href='/NABRE/41/2/13'>MAK 2:13-22</a>.
NABRE,40,9,9,"[6] A man named Matthew: Mark names this tax collector Levi (<a href='/NABRE/41/2/14'>MAK 2:14</a>). No such name appears in the four lists of the twelve who were the closest companions of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/2'>MAT 10:2-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/3/16'>MAK 3:16-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/14'>LUK 6:14-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/1/13'>ACT 1:13</a> [eleven, because of the defection of Judas Iscariot]), whereas all four list a Matthew, designated in <a href='/NABRE/40/10/3'>MAT 10:3</a> as ""the tax collector."" The evangelist may have changed the ""Levi"" of his source to Matthewso that this man, whose call is given special notice, like that of the first four disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/4/18'>MAT 4:18-22</a>), might be included among the twelve. Another reason for the change may be that the disciple Matthew was the source of traditions peculiar to the church for which the evangelist was writing."
NABRE,40,9,10,[7] His house: it is not clear whether hisrefers to Jesus or Matthew. Tax collectors: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/5/46'>MAT 5:46</a>. Table association with such persons would cause ritual impurity.
NABRE,40,9,11,[8] Teacher: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/19'>MAT 8:19</a>.
NABRE,40,9,12,[9] See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/2/17'>MAK 2:17</a>.
NABRE,40,9,13,"[10] Go and learn…not sacrifice: Matthew adds the prophetic statement of <a href='/NABRE/28/6/6'>HOS 6:6</a> to the Marcan account (see also <a href='/NABRE/40/12/7'>MAT 12:7</a>). If mercy is superior to the temple sacrifices, how much more to the laws of ritual impurity."
NABRE,40,9,15,"[11] Fasting is a sign of mourning and would be as inappropriate at this time of joy, when Jesus is proclaiming the kingdom, as it would be at a marriage feast. Yet the saying looks forward to the time when Jesus will no longer be with the disciples visibly, the time of Matthews church. Then they will fast: see Didache <a href='/NABRE/40/8/1'>8:1</a>."
NABRE,40,9,16,"[12] 9:16-17 Each of these parables speaks of the unsuitability of attempting to combine the old and the new. Jesus teaching is not a patching up of Judaism, nor can the gospel be contained within the limits of Mosaic law."
NABRE,40,9,18,"[13] 9:18-34 In this third group of miracles, the first (<a href='/NABRE/40/9/18'>MAT 9:18-26</a>) is clearly dependent on Mark (<a href='/NABRE/41/5/21'>MAK 5:21-43</a>). Though it tells of two miracles, the cure of the woman had already been included within the story of the raising of the officials daughter, so that the two were probably regarded as a single unit. The other miracles seem to have been derived from Mark and Q, respectively, though there Matthews own editing is much more evident."
NABRE,40,9,18,"[14] Official: literally, ""ruler."" Mark calls him ""one of the synagogue officials"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/5/22'>MAK 5:22</a>). My daughter has just died: Matthew heightens the Marcan ""my daughter is at the point of death"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/5/23'>MAK 5:23</a>)."
NABRE,40,9,20,"[15] Tassel: possibly ""fringe."" The Mosaic law prescribed that tassels be worn on the corners of ones garment as a reminder to keep the commandments (see <a href='/NABRE/4/15/37'>NUM 15:37-39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/22/12'>DEU 22:12</a>)."
NABRE,40,9,24,"[16] Sleeping: sleep is a biblical metaphor for death (see <a href='/NABRE/19/87/6'>PS 87:6</a> LXX; <a href='/NABRE/27/12/2'>DAN 12:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/5/10'>1TS 5:10</a>). Jesus statement is not a denial of the childs real death, but an assurance that she will be roused from her sleep of death."
NABRE,40,9,26,"[17] 9:27-31 This story was probably composed by Matthew out of Marks story of the healing of a blind man named Bartimaeus (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/46'>MAK 10:46-52</a>). Mark places the event late in Jesus ministry, just before his entrance into Jerusalem, and Matthew has followed his Marcan source at that point in his gospel also (see <a href='/NABRE/40/20/29'>MAT 20:29-34</a>). In each of the Matthean stories the single blind man of Mark becomes two. The reason why Matthew would have given a double version of the Marcan story and placed the earlier one here may be that he wished to add a story of Jesus curing the blind at this point in order to prepare for Jesus answer to the emissaries of the Baptist (<a href='/NABRE/40/11/4'>MAT 11:4-6</a>) in which Jesus, recounting his works, begins with his giving sight to the blind."
NABRE,40,9,27,[18] Son of David: this messianic title is connected once with the healing power of Jesus in Mark (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/47'>MAK 10:47-48</a>) and Luke (<a href='/NABRE/42/18/38'>LUK 18:38-39</a>) but more frequently in Matthew (see also <a href='/NABRE/40/12/23'>MAT 12:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/15/22'>15:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/20/30'>20:30-31</a>).
NABRE,40,9,32,"[19] 9:32-34 The source of this story seems to be Q (see <a href='/NABRE/42/11/14'>LUK 11:14-15</a>). As in the preceding healing of the blind, Matthew has two versions of this healing, the later in <a href='/NABRE/40/12/22'>MAT 12:22-24</a> and the earlier here."
NABRE,40,9,34,[20] This spiteful accusation foreshadows the growing opposition to Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/40/11/1'>MAT 11</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/11/12'>12</a>.
NABRE,40,9,35,[21] See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/4/23'>MAT 4:23-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/8/1'>MAT 8:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/9/38'>9:38</a>.
NABRE,40,9,36,[22] See <a href='/NABRE/41/6/34'>MAK 6:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/27/17'>NUM 27:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/22/17'>1KG 22:17</a>.
NABRE,40,9,37,"[23] 9:37-38 This Q saying (see <a href='/NABRE/42/10/2'>LUK 10:2</a>) is only imperfectly related to this context. It presupposes that only God (the master of the harvest) can take the initiative in sending out preachers of the gospel, whereas in Matthews setting it leads into <a href='/NABRE/40/10/1'>MAT 10</a> where Jesus does so."
NABRE,40,10,1,"[1] 10:1-11:1 After an introductory narrative (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/1'>MAT 10:1-4</a>), the second of the discourses of the gospel. It deals with the mission now to be undertaken by the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/5'>MAT 10:5-15</a>), but the perspective broadens and includes the missionary activity of the church between the time of the resurrection and the parousia."
NABRE,40,10,1,"[2] His twelve disciples: although, unlike Mark (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/13'>MAK 3:13-14</a>) and Luke (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/12'>LUK 6:12-16</a>), Matthew has no story of Jesus choosing the Twelve, he assumes that the group is known to the reader. The earliest New Testament text to speak of it is <a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>1CO 15:5</a>. The number probably is meant to recall the twelve tribes of Israel and implies Jesus authority to call all Israel into the kingdom. While Luke (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/13'>LUK 6:13</a>) and probably Mark (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/10'>MAK 4:10, 34</a>) distinguish between the Twelve and a larger group also termed disciples, Matthew tends to identify the disciples and the Twelve. Authority…every illness: activities the same as those of Jesus; see <a href='/NABRE/40/4/23'>MAT 4:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/9/35'>MAT 9:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/10/8'>10:8</a>. The Twelve also share in his proclamation of the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/7'>MAT 10:7</a>). But although he teaches (<a href='/NABRE/40/4/23'>MAT 4:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/7/28'>7:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/9/35'>9:35</a>), they do not. Their commission to teach comes only after Jesus resurrection, after they have been fully instructed by him (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/20'>MAT 28:20</a>)."
NABRE,40,10,2,"[3] 10:2-4 Here, for the only time in Matthew, the Twelve are designated apostles. The word ""apostle"" means ""one who is sent,"" and therefore fits the situation here described. In the Pauline letters, the place where the term occurs most frequently in the New Testament, it means primarily one who has seen the risen Lord and has been commissioned to proclaim the resurrection. With slight variants in Luke and Acts, the names of those who belong to this group are the same in the four lists given in the New Testament (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/9'>MAT 9:9</a>). Cananean: this represents an Aramaic word meaning ""zealot."" The meaning of that designation is unclear (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/6/15'>LUK 6:15</a>)."
NABRE,40,10,5,"[4] 10:5-6 Like Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/24'>MAT 15:24</a>), the Twelve are sent only to Israel. This saying may reflect an original Jewish Christian refusal of the mission to the Gentiles, but for Matthew it expresses rather the limitation that Jesus himself observed during his ministry."
NABRE,40,10,8,"[5] 10:8-11 The Twelve have received their own call and mission through Gods gift, and the benefits they confer are likewise to be given freely. They are not to take with them money, provisions, or unnecessary clothing; their lodging and food will be provided by those who receive them."
NABRE,40,10,13,"[6] The greeting of peace is conceived of not merely as a salutation but as an effective word. If it finds no worthy recipient, it will return to the speaker."
NABRE,40,10,14,[7] Shake the dust from your feet: this gesture indicates a complete disassociation from such unbelievers.
NABRE,40,10,17,[8] The persecutions attendant upon the post-resurrection mission now begin to be spoken of. Here Matthew brings into the discourse sayings found in <a href='/NABRE/41/13/1'>MAK 13</a> which deals with events preceding the parousia.
NABRE,40,10,21,"[9] See <a href='/NABRE/33/7/6'>MIC 7:6</a> which is cited in <a href='/NABRE/40/10/35'>MAT 10:35, 36</a>."
NABRE,40,10,22,"[10] To the end: the original meaning was probably ""until the parousia."" But it is not likely that Matthew expected no missionary disciples to suffer death before then, since he envisages the martyrdom of other Christians (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/21'>MAT 10:21</a>). For him, the endis probably that of the individuals life (see <a href='/NABRE/40/10/28'>MAT 10:28</a>)."
NABRE,40,10,23,"[11] Before the Son of Man comes: since the coming of the Son of Man at the end of the age had not taken place when this gospel was written, much less during the mission of the Twelve during Jesus ministry, Matthew cannot have meant the coming to refer to the parousia. It is difficult to know what he understood it to be: perhaps the ""proleptic parousia"" of <a href='/NABRE/40/28/16'>MAT 28:16-20</a>, or the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70, viewed as a coming of Jesus in judgment on unbelieving Israel."
NABRE,40,10,25,"[12] Beelzebul: see <a href='/NABRE/40/9/34'>MAT 9:34</a> for the charge linking Jesus with ""the prince of demons,"" who is named Beelzebulin <a href='/NABRE/40/12/24'>MAT 12:24</a>. The meaning of the name is uncertain; possibly, ""lord of the house."""
NABRE,40,10,26,"[13] The concealedand secretcoming of the kingdom is to be proclaimed by them, and no fear must be allowed to deter them from that proclamation."
NABRE,40,10,32,"[14] 10:32-33 In the Q parallel (<a href='/NABRE/42/12/8'>LUK 12:8-9</a>), the Son of Man will acknowledge those who have acknowledged Jesus, and those who deny him will be denied (by the Son of Man) before the angels of God at the judgment. Here Jesus and the Son of Man are identified, and the acknowledgment or denial will be before his heavenly Father."
NABRE,40,10,38,"[15] The first mention of the cross in Matthew, explicitly that of the disciple, but implicitly that of Jesus (and follow after me). Crucifixion was a form of capital punishment used by the Romans for offenders who were not Roman citizens."
NABRE,40,10,39,[16] One who denies Jesus in order to save ones earthly life will be condemned to everlasting destruction; loss of earthly life for Jesus sake will be rewarded by everlasting life in the kingdom.
NABRE,40,10,40,"[17] 10:40-42 All who receive the disciples of Jesus receive him, and God who sent him, and will be rewarded accordingly."
NABRE,40,10,41,"[18] A prophet: one who speaks in the name of God; here, the Christian prophets who proclaim the gospel. Righteous man: since righteousness is demanded of all the disciples, it is difficult to take the righteous manof this verse and one of these little ones(<a href='/NABRE/40/10/42'>MAT 10:42</a>) as indicating different groups within the followers of Jesus. Probably all three designations are used here of Christian missionaries as such."
NABRE,40,11,1,"[1] The closing formula of the discourse refers back to the original addressees, the Twelve."
NABRE,40,11,2,"[2] 11:2-12:50 The narrative section of the third book deals with the growing opposition to Jesus. It is largely devoted to disputes and attacks relating to faith and discipleship and thus contains much sayings-material, drawn in large part from Q."
NABRE,40,11,2,[3] In prison: see <a href='/NABRE/40/4/12'>MAT 4:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/14/1'>14:1-12</a>. The works of the Messiah: the deeds of <a href='/NABRE/40/8/1'>MAT 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/9/1'>9</a>.
NABRE,40,11,3,[4] The question probably expresses a doubt of the Baptist that Jesus is the one who is to come(cf. <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1</a>) because his mission has not been one of fiery judgment as John had expected (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>).
NABRE,40,11,5,[5] 11:5-6 Jesus response is taken from passages of Isaiah (<a href='/NABRE/23/26/19'>ISA 26:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/29/18'>29:18-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/35/5'>35:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/61/1'>61:1</a>) that picture the time of salvation as marked by deeds such as those that Jesus is doing. The beatitude is a warning to the Baptist not to disbelieve because his expectations have not been met.
NABRE,40,11,6,[6] 11:7-19 Jesus rebuke of John is counterbalanced by a reminder of the greatness of the Baptists function (<a href='/NABRE/40/11/7'>MAT 11:7-15</a>) that is followed by a complaint about those who have heeded neither John nor Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/11/16'>MAT 11:16-19</a>).
NABRE,40,11,9,"[7] 11:9-10 In common Jewish belief there had been no prophecy in Israel since the last of the Old Testament prophets, Malachi. The coming of a new prophet was eagerly awaited, and Jesus agrees that John was such. Yet he was more than a prophet, for he was the precursor of the one who would bring in the new and final age. The Old Testament quotation is a combination of <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/23/20'>EXO 23:20</a> with the significant change that the before meof Malachi becomes before you. The messenger now precedes not God, as in the original, but Jesus."
NABRE,40,11,11,[8] Johns preeminent greatness lies in his function of announcing the imminence of the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/1'>MAT 3:1</a>). But to be in the kingdom is so great a privilege that the least who has it is greater than the Baptist.
NABRE,40,11,12,[9] The meaning of this difficult saying is probably that the opponents of Jesus are trying to prevent people from accepting the kingdom and to snatch it away from those who have received it.
NABRE,40,11,13,"[10] All the prophets and the law: Matthew inverts the usual order, ""law and prophets,"" and says that both have prophesied. This emphasis on the prophetic character of the law points to its fulfillment in the teaching of Jesus and to the transitory nature of some of its commandments (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/5/17'>MAT 5:17-20</a>)."
NABRE,40,11,16,"[11] 11:16-19 See <a href='/NABRE/42/7/31'>LUK 7:31-35</a>. The meaning of the parable (<a href='/NABRE/40/11/16'>MAT 11:16-17</a>) and its explanation (<a href='/NABRE/40/11/18'>MAT 11:18-19</a>b) is much disputed. A plausible view is that the childrenof the parable are two groups, one of which proposes different entertainments to the other that will not agree with either proposal. The first represents John, Jesus, and their disciples; the second those who reject John for his asceticism and Jesus for his table association with those despised by the religiously observant. <a href='/NABRE/40/11/19'>MAT 11:19</a>c (her works) forms an inclusion with <a href='/NABRE/40/11/2'>MAT 11:2</a> (""the works of the Messiah""). The original form of the saying is better preserved in <a href='/NABRE/42/7/35'>LUK 7:35</a> ""…wisdom is vindicated by all her children."" There John and Jesus are the children of Wisdom; here the works of Jesus the Messiah are those of divine Wisdom, of which he is the embodiment. Some important textual witnesses, however, have essentially the same reading as in Luke."
NABRE,40,11,21,[12] Tyre and Sidon were pagan cities denounced for their wickedness in the Old Testament; cf. <a href='/NABRE/29/4/4'>JOE 4:4-7</a>.
NABRE,40,11,23,[13] Capernaums pride and punishment are described in language taken from the taunt song against the king of Babylon (<a href='/NABRE/23/14/13'>ISA 14:13-15</a>).
NABRE,40,11,25,"[14] 11:25-27 This Q saying, identical with <a href='/NABRE/42/10/21'>LUK 10:21-22</a> except for minor variations, introduces a joyous note into this section, so dominated by the theme of unbelief. While the wise and the learned, the scribes and Pharisees, have rejected Jesus preaching and the significance of his mighty deeds, the childlikehave accepted them. Acceptance depends upon the Fathers revelation, but this is granted to those who are open to receive it and refused to the arrogant. Jesus can speak of all mysteries because he is the Sonand there is perfect reciprocity of knowledge between him and the Father; what has been handed overto him is revealed only to those whom he wishes."
NABRE,40,11,28,"[15] 11:28-29 These verses are peculiar to Matthew and are similar to Ben Sirachs invitation to learn wisdom and submit to her yoke (<a href='/NABRE/71/51/23'>SIR 51:23, 26</a>)."
NABRE,40,11,28,[16] Who labor and are burdened: burdened by the law as expounded by the scribes and Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/4'>MAT 23:4</a>).
NABRE,40,11,29,"[17] In place of the yoke of the law, complicated by scribal interpretation, Jesus invites the burdened to take the yoke of obedience to his word, under which they will find rest; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/6/16'>JER 6:16</a>."
NABRE,40,12,1,"[1] 12:1-14 Matthew here returns to the Marcan order that he left in <a href='/NABRE/40/9/18'>MAT 9:18</a>. The two stories depend on <a href='/NABRE/41/2/23'>MAK 2:23-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/3/1'>3:1-6</a>, respectively, and are the only places in either gospel that deal explicitly with Jesus attitude toward sabbath observance."
NABRE,40,12,1,"[2] 12:1-2 The picking of the heads of grain is here equated with reaping, which was forbidden on the sabbath (<a href='/NABRE/2/34/21'>EXO 34:21</a>)."
NABRE,40,12,3,"[3] 12:3-4 See <a href='/NABRE/9/21/2'>1SM 21:2-7</a>. In the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/2/25'>MAK 2:25-26</a>) the high priest is called Abiathar, although in 1 Samuel this action is attributed to Ahimelech. The Old Testament story is not about a violation of the sabbath rest; its pertinence to this dispute is that a violation of the law was permissible because of Davids men being without food."
NABRE,40,12,5,"[4] 12:5-6 This and the following argument (<a href='/NABRE/40/12/7'>MAT 12:7</a>) are peculiar to Matthew. The temple service seems to be the changing of the showbread on the sabbath (<a href='/NABRE/3/24/8'>LEV 24:8</a>) and the doubling on the sabbath of the usual daily holocausts (<a href='/NABRE/4/28/9'>NUM 28:9-10</a>). The argument is that the law itself requires work that breaks the sabbath rest, because of the higher duty of temple service. If temple duties outweigh the sabbath law, how much more does the presence of Jesus, with his proclamation of the kingdom (something greater than the temple), justify the conduct of his disciples."
NABRE,40,12,7,[5] See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/13'>MAT 9:13</a>.
NABRE,40,12,8,"[6] The ultimate justification for the disciples violation of the sabbath rest is that Jesus, the Son of Man, has supreme authority over the law."
NABRE,40,12,10,[7] Rabbinic tradition later than the gospels allowed relief to be given to a sufferer on the sabbath if life was in danger. This may also have been the view of Jesus Pharisaic contemporaries. But the case here is not about one in danger of death.
NABRE,40,12,11,"[8] Matthew omits the question posed by Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/41/3/4'>MAK 3:4</a> and substitutes one about rescuing a sheep on the sabbath, similar to that in <a href='/NABRE/42/14/5'>LUK 14:5</a>."
NABRE,40,12,14,"[9] See <a href='/NABRE/41/3/6'>MAK 3:6</a>. Here the plan to bring about Jesus death is attributed to the Pharisees only. This is probably due to the situation of Matthews church, when the sole opponents were the Pharisees."
NABRE,40,12,14,"[10] 12:15-21 Matthew follows <a href='/NABRE/41/3/7'>MAK 3:7-12</a> but summarizes his source in two verses (<a href='/NABRE/40/12/15'>MAT 12:15, 16</a>) that pick up the withdrawal, the healings, and the command for silence. To this he adds a fulfillment citation from the first Servant Song (<a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>ISA 42:1-4</a>) that does not correspond exactly to either the Hebrew or the LXX of that passage. It is the longest Old Testament citation in this gospel, emphasizing the meekness of Jesus, the Servant of the Lord, and foretelling the extension of his mission to the Gentiles."
NABRE,40,12,15,[11] Jesus knowledge of the Pharisees plot and his healing all are peculiar to Matthew.
NABRE,40,12,19,[12] The servants not contending is seen as fulfilled in Jesus withdrawal from the disputes narrated in <a href='/NABRE/40/12/1'>MAT 12:1-14</a>.
NABRE,40,12,21,"[13] Except for a minor detail, Matthew here follows the LXX, although the meaning of the Hebrew (""the coastlands will wait for his teaching"") is similar."
NABRE,40,12,21,"[14] 12:22-32 For the exorcism, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/32'>MAT 9:32-34</a>. The long discussion combines Marcan and Q material (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/22'>MAK 3:22-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/11/19'>LUK 11:19-20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/11/23'>23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/10'>12:10</a>). <a href='/NABRE/41/3/20'>MAK 3:20-21</a> is omitted, with a consequent lessening of the sharpness of <a href='/NABRE/40/12/48'>MAT 12:48</a>."

NABRE,40,12,25,"[17] 12:25-26 Jesus first response to the Pharisees charge is that if it were true, Satan would be destroying his own kingdom."
NABRE,40,12,27,"[18] Besides pointing out the absurdity of the charge, Jesus asks how the work of Jewish exorcists (your own people) is to be interpreted. Are they, too, to be charged with collusion with Beelzebul? For an example of Jewish exorcism see Josephus, Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/40/8/42'>8:42-49</a>."
NABRE,40,12,28,"[19] The Q parallel (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/20'>LUK 11:20</a>) speaks of the ""finger"" rather than of the ""spirit"" of God. While the difference is probably due to Matthews editing, he retains the kingdom of Godrather than changing it to his usual ""kingdom of heaven."" Has come upon you: see <a href='/NABRE/40/4/17'>MAT 4:17</a>."
NABRE,40,12,29,"[20] A short parable illustrates what Jesus is doing. The strong manis Satan, whom Jesus has tied up and whose househe is plundering. Jewish expectation was that Satan would be chained up in the last days (<a href='/NABRE/66/20/2'>REV 20:2</a>); Jesus exorcisms indicate that those days have begun."
NABRE,40,12,30,"[21] This saying, already attached to the preceding verses in Q (see <a href='/NABRE/42/11/23'>LUK 11:23</a>), warns that there can be no neutrality where Jesus is concerned. Its pertinence in a context where Jesus is addressing not the neutral but the bitterly opposed is not clear. The accusation of scattering, however, does fit the situation. Jesus is the shepherd of Gods people (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/6'>MAT 2:6</a>), his mission is to the lost sheep of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/24'>MAT 15:24</a>); the Pharisees, who oppose him, are guilty of scattering the sheep."
NABRE,40,12,31,[22] Blasphemy against the Spirit: the sin of attributing to Satan (<a href='/NABRE/40/12/24'>MAT 12:24</a>) what is the work of the Spirit of God (<a href='/NABRE/40/12/28'>MAT 12:28</a>).
NABRE,40,12,33,"[23] Declare: literally, ""make."" The meaning of this verse is obscure. Possibly it is a challenge to the Pharisees either to declare Jesus and his exorcisms good or both of them bad. A tree is known by its fruit; if the fruit is good, so must the tree be. If the driving out of demons is good, so must its source be."
NABRE,40,12,34,"[24] The admission of Jesus goodness cannot be made by the Pharisees, for they are evil, and the words that proceed from their evil hearts cannot be good."
NABRE,40,12,36,"[25] 12:36-37 If on the day of judgment people will be held accountable for even their carelesswords, the vicious accusations of the Pharisees will surely lead to their condemnation."
NABRE,40,12,37,"[26] 12:38-42 This section is mainly from Q (see <a href='/NABRE/42/11/29'>LUK 11:29-32</a>). <a href='/NABRE/41/8/11'>MAK 8:11-12</a>, which Matthew has followed in <a href='/NABRE/40/16/1'>MAT 16:1-4</a>, has a similar demand for a sign. The scribes and Pharisees refuse to accept the exorcisms of Jesus as authentication of his claims and demand a sign that will end all possibility of doubt. Jesus response is that no such sign will be given. Because his opponents are evil and see him as an agent of Satan, nothing will convince them."
NABRE,40,12,38,"[27] Teacher: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/19'>MAT 8:19</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/40/16/1'>MAT 16:1</a> the request is for a sign ""from heaven"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/11'>MAK 8:11</a>)."
NABRE,40,12,39,"[28] Unfaithful: literally, ""adulterous."" The covenant between God and Israel was portrayed as a marriage bond, and unfaithfulness to the covenant as adultery; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/2/4'>HOS 2:4-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/3/6'>JER 3:6-10</a>."
NABRE,40,12,40,"[29] See <a href='/NABRE/32/2/1'>JON 2:1</a>. While in Q the sign was simply Jonahs preaching to the Ninevites (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/30'>LUK 11:30, 32</a>), Matthew here adds Jonahs sojourn in the belly of the whalefor three days and three nights, a prefigurement of Jesus sojourn in the abode of the dead and, implicitly, of his resurrection."
NABRE,40,12,41,"[30] 12:41-42 The Ninevites who repented(see <a href='/NABRE/32/3/1'>JON 3:1-10</a>) and the queen of the south(i.e., of Sheba; see <a href='/NABRE/11/10/1'>1KG 10:1-13</a>) were pagans who responded to lesser opportunities than have been offered to Israel in the ministry of Jesus, something greater than Jonahor Solomon. At the final judgment they will condemn the faithless generationthat has rejected him."
NABRE,40,12,42,"[31] 12:43-45 Another Q passage; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/11/24'>MAT 11:24-26</a>. Jesus ministry has broken Satans hold over Israel, but the refusal of this evil generationto accept him will lead to a worse situation than what preceded his coming."
NABRE,40,12,45,"[32] 12:46-50 See <a href='/NABRE/41/3/31'>MAK 3:31-35</a>. Matthew has omitted <a href='/NABRE/41/3/20'>MAK 3:20-21</a> which is taken up in <a href='/NABRE/41/3/31'>MAK 3:31</a> (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/12/22'>MAT 12:22-32</a>), yet the point of the story is the same in both gospels: natural kinship with Jesus counts for nothing; only one who does the willof his heavenly Fatherbelongs to his true family."
NABRE,40,12,47,"[1] This verse is omitted in some important textual witnesses, including Codex Sinaiticus (original reading) and Codex Vaticanus."
NABRE,40,13,1,"[1] 13:1-53 The discourse in parables is the third great discourse of Jesus in Matthew and constitutes the second part of the third book of the gospel. Matthew follows the Marcan outline (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/1'>MAK 4:1-35</a>) but has only two of Marks parables, the five others being from Q and M. In addition to the seven parables, the discourse gives the reason why Jesus uses this type of speech (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/10'>MAT 13:10-15</a>), declares the blessedness of those who understand his teaching (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/16'>MAT 13:16-17</a>), explains the parable of the sower (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/18'>MAT 13:18-23</a>) and of the weeds (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/36'>MAT 13:36-43</a>), and ends with a concluding statement to the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/51'>MAT 13:51-52</a>)."
NABRE,40,13,3,"[2] In parables: the word ""parable"" (Greek parabolē) is used in the LXX to translate the Hebrew māshāl, a designation covering a wide variety of literary forms such as axioms, proverbs, similitudes, and allegories. In the New Testament the same breadth of meaning of the word is found, but there it primarily designates stories that are illustrative comparisons between Christian truths and events of everyday life. Sometimes the event has a strange element that is quite different from usual experience (e.g., in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/33'>MAT 13:33</a> the enormous amount of dough in the parable of the yeast); this is meant to sharpen the curiosity of the hearer. If each detail of such a story is given a figurative meaning, the story is an allegory. Those who maintain a sharp distinction between parable and allegory insist that a parable has only one point of comparison, and that while parables were characteristic of Jesus teaching, to see allegorical details in them is to introduce meanings that go beyond their original intention and even falsify it. However, to exclude any allegorical elements from a parable is an excessively rigid mode of interpretation, now abandoned by many scholars."
NABRE,40,13,3,"[3] 13:3-8 Since in Palestine sowing often preceded plowing, much of the seed is scattered on ground that is unsuitable. Yet while much is wasted, the seed that falls on good ground bears fruit in extraordinarily large measure. The point of the parable is that, in spite of some failure because of opposition and indifference, the message of Jesus about the coming of the kingdom will have enormous success."
NABRE,40,13,11,"[4] Since a parable is figurative speech that demands reflection for understanding, only those who are prepared to explore its meaning can come to know it. To understand is a gift of God, granted to the disciples but not to the crowds. In Semitic fashion, both the disciples understanding and the crowds obtuseness are attributed to God. The question of human responsibility for the obtuseness is not dealt with, although it is asserted in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/13'>MAT 13:13</a>. The mysteries: as in <a href='/NABRE/42/8/10'>LUK 8:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/4/11'>MAK 4:11</a> has ""the mystery."" The word is used in <a href='/NABRE/27/2/18'>DAN 2:18, 19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/2/27'>27</a> and in the Qumran literature (1QpHab 7:8; 1QS 3:23; 1QM 3:9) to designate a divine plan or decree affecting the course of history that can be known only when revealed. Knowledge of the mysteries of the kingdom of heavenmeans recognition that the kingdom has become present in the ministry of Jesus."
NABRE,40,13,12,"[5] In the New Testament use of this axiom of practical ""wisdom"" (see <a href='/NABRE/40/25/29'>MAT 25:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/4/25'>MAK 4:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/18'>LUK 8:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/19/26'>19:26</a>), the reference transcends the original level. God gives further understanding to one who accepts the revealed mystery; from the one who does not, he will take it away (note the ""theological passive,"" more will be given, what he has will be taken away)."
NABRE,40,13,13,"[6] Because they look…or understand: Matthew softens his Marcan source, which states that Jesus speaks in parables so that the crowds may not understand (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/12'>MAK 4:12</a>), and makes such speaking a punishment given becausethey have not accepted his previous clear teaching. However, his citation of <a href='/NABRE/23/6/9'>ISA 6:9-10</a> in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/14'>MAT 13:14</a> supports the harsher Marcan view."
NABRE,40,13,15,"[7] 13:16-17 Unlike the unbelieving crowds, the disciples have seen that which the prophetsand the righteousof the Old Testament longed to seewithout having their longing fulfilled."
NABRE,40,13,17,"[8] 13:18-23 See <a href='/NABRE/41/4/14'>MAK 4:14-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/11'>LUK 8:11-15</a>. In this explanation of the parable the emphasis is on the various types of soil on which the seed falls, i.e., on the dispositions with which the preaching of Jesus is received. The second and third types particularly are explained in such a way as to support the view held by many scholars that the explanation derives not from Jesus but from early Christian reflection upon apostasy from the faith that was the consequence of persecution and worldliness, respectively. Others, however, hold that the explanation may come basically from Jesus even though it was developed in the light of later Christian experience. The four types of persons envisaged are (1) those who never accept the word of the kingdom(<a href='/NABRE/40/13/19'>MAT 13:19</a>); (2) those who believe for a while but fall away because of persecution(<a href='/NABRE/40/13/20'>MAT 13:20-21</a>); (3) those who believe, but in whom the wordis choked by worldly anxietyand the seduction of riches(<a href='/NABRE/40/13/22'>MAT 13:22</a>); (4) those who respond to the wordand produce fruitabundantly (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/23'>MAT 13:23</a>)."
NABRE,40,13,24,[9] 13:24-30 This parable is peculiar to Matthew. The comparison in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/24'>MAT 13:24</a> does not mean that the kingdom of heaven may be likenedsimply to the person in question but to the situation narrated in the whole story. The refusal of the householderto allow his slavesto separate the wheatfrom the weedswhile they are still growing is a warning to the disciples not to attempt to anticipate the final judgment of God by a definitive exclusion of sinners from the kingdom. In its present stage it is composed of the good and the bad. The judgment of God alone will eliminate the sinful. Until then there must be patience and the preaching of repentance.
NABRE,40,13,25,"[10] Weeds: darnel, a poisonous weed that in its first stage of growth resembles wheat."
NABRE,40,13,30,[11] Harvest: a common biblical metaphor for the time of Gods judgment; cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/51/33'>JER 51:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/29/4/13'>JOE 4:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/6/11'>HOS 6:11</a>.
NABRE,40,13,30,[12] 13:31-33 See <a href='/NABRE/41/4/30'>MAK 4:30-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/13/18'>LUK 13:18-21</a>. The parables of the mustard seed and the yeast illustrate the same point: the amazing contrast between the small beginnings of the kingdom and its marvelous expansion.
NABRE,40,13,32,"[13] See <a href='/NABRE/27/4/7'>DAN 4:7-9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/4/17'>17-19</a> where the birds nesting in the tree represent the people of Nebuchadnezzars kingdom. See also <a href='/NABRE/26/17/23'>EZE 17:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/31/6'>31:6</a>."
NABRE,40,13,33,"[14] Except in this Q parable and in <a href='/NABRE/40/16/12'>MAT 16:12</a>, yeast(or ""leaven"") is, in New Testament usage, a symbol of corruption (see <a href='/NABRE/40/16/6'>MAT 16:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/16/11'>11-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/8/15'>MAK 8:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/1'>LUK 12:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/5/6'>1CO 5:6-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/5/9'>GAL 5:9</a>). Three measures: an enormous amount, enough to feed a hundred people. The exaggeration of this element of the parable points to the greatness of the kingdoms effect."
NABRE,40,13,34,[15] Only in parables: see <a href='/NABRE/40/13/10'>MAT 13:10-15</a>.
NABRE,40,13,35,"[16] The prophet: some textual witnesses read ""Isaiah the prophet."" The quotation is actually from <a href='/NABRE/19/78/2'>PS 78:2</a>; the first line corresponds to the LXX text of the psalm. The psalms title ascribes it to Asaph, the founder of one of the guilds of temple musicians. He is called ""the prophet"" (NAB ""the seer"") in <a href='/NABRE/14/29/30'>2CH 29:30</a>, but it is doubtful that Matthew averted to that; for him, any Old Testament text that could be seen as fulfilled in Jesus was prophetic."
NABRE,40,13,36,"[17] Dismissing the crowds: the return of Jesus to the house marks a break with the crowds, who represent unbelieving Israel. From now on his attention is directed more and more to his disciples and to their instruction. The rest of the discourse is addressed to them alone."
NABRE,40,13,37,"[18] 13:37-43 In the explanation of the parable of the weeds emphasis lies on the fearful end of the wicked, whereas the parable itself concentrates on patience with them until judgment time."
NABRE,40,13,38,"[19] The field is the world: this presupposes the resurrection of Jesus and the granting to him of ""all power in heaven and on earth"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/18'>MAT 28:18</a>)."
NABRE,40,13,39,"[20] The end of the age: this phrase is found only in Matthew (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/40'>13:40, 49</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/3'>24:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/28/20'>28:20</a>)."
NABRE,40,13,41,"[21] His kingdom: the kingdomof the Son of Manis distinguished from that of the Father (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/43'>MAT 13:43</a>); see <a href='/NABRE/46/15/24'>1CO 15:24-25</a>. The church is the place where Jesus kingdom is manifested, but his royal authority embraces the entire world; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/38'>MAT 13:38</a>."
NABRE,40,13,43,[22] See <a href='/NABRE/27/12/3'>DAN 12:3</a>.
NABRE,40,13,43,"[23] 13:44-50 The first two of the last three parables of the discourse have the same point. The personwho findsa buried treasureand the merchantwho finds a pearl of great pricesell allthat they have to acquire these finds; similarly, the one who understands the supreme value of the kingdom gives up whatever he must to obtain it. The joywith which this is done is made explicit in the first parable, but it may be presumed in the second also. The concluding parable of the fishnet resembles the explanation of the parable of the weeds with its stress upon the final exclusion of evil persons from the kingdom."
NABRE,40,13,44,"[24] In the unsettled conditions of Palestine in Jesus time, it was not unusual to guard valuables by burying them in the ground."
NABRE,40,13,51,[25] Matthew typically speaks of the understanding of the disciples.
NABRE,40,13,52,"[26] Since Matthew tends to identify the disciples and the Twelve (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/10/1'>MAT 10:1</a>), this saying about the Christian scribecannot be taken as applicable to all who accept the message of Jesus. While the Twelve are in many ways representative of all who believe in him, they are also distinguished from them in certain respects. The church of Matthew has leaders among whom are a group designated as ""scribes"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/34'>MAT 23:34</a>). Like the scribes of Israel, they are teachers. It is the Twelve and these their later counterparts to whom this verse applies. The scribe…instructed in the kingdom of heavenknows both the teaching of Jesus (the new) and the law and prophets (the old) and provides in his own teaching both the new and the oldas interpreted and fulfilled by the new. On the translation head of a household(for the same Greek word translated householderin <a href='/NABRE/40/13/27'>MAT 13:27</a>), see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/24/45'>MAT 24:45-51</a>."
NABRE,40,13,54,[27] 13:54-17:27 This section is the narrative part of the fourth book of the gospel.
NABRE,40,13,54,"[28] 13:54-58 After the Sermon on the Mount the crowds are in admiring astonishment at Jesus teaching (<a href='/NABRE/40/7/28'>MAT 7:28</a>); here the astonishment is of those who take offense at him. Familiarity with his background and family leads them to regard him as pretentious. Matthew modifies his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/1'>MAT 6:1-6</a>). Jesus is not the carpenter but the carpenters son(<a href='/NABRE/40/13/55'>MAT 13:55</a>), ""and among his own kin"" is omitted (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/57'>MAT 13:57</a>), he did not work many mighty deedsin face of such unbelief (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/58'>MAT 13:58</a>) rather than the Marcan ""…he was not able to perform any mighty deed there"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/5'>MAT 6:5</a>), and there is no mention of his amazement at his townspeoples lack of faith."
NABRE,40,14,1,"[1] 14:1-12 The murder of the Baptist by Herod Antipas prefigures the death of Jesus (see <a href='/NABRE/40/17/12'>MAT 17:12</a>). The Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/14'>MAK 6:14-29</a>) is much reduced and in some points changed. In Mark Herod reveres John as a holy man and the desire to kill him is attributed to Herodias (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/19'>MAK 6:19, 20</a>), whereas here that desire is Herods from the beginning (<a href='/NABRE/40/14/5'>MAT 14:5</a>)."
NABRE,40,14,1,"[2] Herod the tetrarch: Herod Antipas, son of Herod the Great. When the latter died, his territory was divided among three of his surviving sons, Archelaus who received half of it (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/23'>MAT 2:23</a>), Herod Antipas who became ruler of Galilee and Perea, and Philip who became ruler of northern Transjordan. Since he received a quarter of his fathers domain, Antipas is accurately designated tetrarch(""ruler of a fourth [part]""), although in <a href='/NABRE/40/14/9'>MAT 14:9</a> Matthew repeats the ""king"" of his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/26'>MAK 6:26</a>)."
NABRE,40,14,3,"[3] Herodias was not the wife of Herods half-brother Philip but of another half-brother, Herod Boethus. The union was prohibited by <a href='/NABRE/3/18/16'>LEV 18:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/20/21'>20:21</a>. According to Josephus (Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/40/18/116'>18:116-19</a>), Herod imprisoned and then executed John because he feared that the Baptists influence over the people might enable him to lead a rebellion."
NABRE,40,14,12,"[4] 14:13-21 The feeding of the five thousand is the only miracle of Jesus that is recounted in all four gospels. The principal reason for that may be that it was seen as anticipating the Eucharist and the final banquet in the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/29'>26:29</a>), but it looks not only forward but backward, to the feeding of Israel with manna in the desert at the time of the Exodus (<a href='/NABRE/2/16/1'>EXO 16</a>), a miracle that in some contemporary Jewish expectation would be repeated in the messianic age (2 <a href='/NABRE/73/29/8'>BAR 29:8</a>). It may also be meant to recall Elishas feeding a hundred men with small provisions (<a href='/NABRE/12/4/42'>2KG 4:42-44</a>)."
NABRE,40,14,19,"[5] The taking, saying the blessing, breaking, and giving to the disciples correspond to the actions of Jesus over the bread at the Last Supper (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/26'>MAT 26:26</a>). Since they were usual at any Jewish meal, that correspondence does not necessarily indicate a eucharistic reference here. Matthews silence about Jesus dividing the fish among the people (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/41'>MAK 6:41</a>) is perhaps more significant in that regard."
NABRE,40,14,20,"[6] The fragments left over: as in Elishas miracle, food was left overafter all had been fed. The word fragments(Greek klasmata) is used, in the singular, of the broken bread of the Eucharist in Didache <a href='/NABRE/40/9/3'>9:3-4</a>."
NABRE,40,14,21,"[7] 14:22-33 The disciples, laboring against the turbulent sea, are saved by Jesus. For his power over the waters, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/26'>MAT 8:26</a>. Here that power is expressed also by his walking on the sea(<a href='/NABRE/40/14/25'>MAT 14:25</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/77/20'>PS 77:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/9/8'>JOB 9:8</a>). Matthew has inserted into the Marcan story (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/45'>MAK 6:45-52</a>) material that belongs to his special traditions on Peter (<a href='/NABRE/40/14/28'>MAT 14:28-31</a>)."
NABRE,40,14,25,"[8] The fourth watch of the night: between 3 a.m. and 6 a.m. The Romans divided the twelve hours between 6 p.m. and 6 a.m. into four equal parts called ""watches."""

NABRE,40,15,1,"[1] 15:1-20 This dispute begins with the question of the Pharisees and scribes why Jesus disciples are breaking the tradition of the eldersabout washing ones hands before eating (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/2'>MAT 15:2</a>). Jesus counterquestion accuses his opponents of breaking the commandment of God for the sake oftheir tradition(<a href='/NABRE/40/15/3'>MAT 15:3</a>) and illustrates this by their interpretation of the commandment of the Decalogue concerning parents (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/4'>MAT 15:4-6</a>). Denouncing them as hypocrites, he applies to them a derogatory prophecy of Isaiah (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/7'>MAT 15:7-8</a>). Then with a wider audience (the crowd, <a href='/NABRE/40/15/10'>MAT 15:10</a>) he goes beyond the violation of tradition with which the dispute has started. The parable (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/11'>MAT 15:11</a>) is an attack on the Mosaic law concerning clean and unclean foods, similar to those antitheses that abrogate the law (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/31'>MAT 5:31-32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/33'>33-34</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/5/38'>38-39</a>). After a warning to his disciples not to follow the moral guidance of the Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/13'>MAT 15:13-14</a>), he explains the parable(<a href='/NABRE/40/15/15'>MAT 15:15</a>) to them, saying that defilement comes not from what enters the mouth(<a href='/NABRE/40/15/17'>MAT 15:17</a>) but from the evil thoughts and deeds that rise from within, from the heart(<a href='/NABRE/40/15/18'>MAT 15:18-20</a>). The last verse returns to the starting point of the dispute (eating with unwashed hands). Because of Matthews omission of <a href='/NABRE/41/7/19'>MAK 7:19</a>b, some scholars think that Matthew has weakened the Marcan repudiation of the Mosaic food laws. But that half verse is ambiguous in the Greek, which may be the reason for its omission here."
NABRE,40,15,2,[2] The tradition of the elders: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/7/5'>MAK 7:5</a>. The purpose of the handwashing was to remove defilement caused by contact with what was ritually unclean.

NABRE,40,15,15,"[7] Matthew specifies Peteras the questioner, unlike <a href='/NABRE/41/7/17'>MAK 7:17</a>. Given his tendency to present the disciples as more understanding than in his Marcan source, it is noteworthy that here he retains the Marcan rebuke, although in a slightly milder form. This may be due to his wish to correct the Jewish Christians within his church who still held to the food laws and thus separated themselves from Gentile Christians who did not observe them."

NABRE,40,15,31,"[13] 15:32-39 Most probably this story is a doublet of that of the feeding of the five thousand (<a href='/NABRE/40/14/13'>MAT 14:13-21</a>). It differs from it notably only in that Jesus takes the initiative, not the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/32'>MAT 15:32</a>), and in the numbers: the crowd has been with Jesus three days(<a href='/NABRE/40/15/32'>MAT 15:32</a>), seven loavesare multiplied (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/36'>MAT 15:36</a>), seven basketsof fragmentsremain after the feeding (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/37'>MAT 15:37</a>), and four thousandmen are fed (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/38'>MAT 15:38</a>)."

NABRE,40,16,2,"[2] 16:2-3 The answer of Jesus in these verses is omitted in many important textual witnesses, and it is very uncertain that it is an original part of this gospel. It resembles <a href='/NABRE/42/12/54'>LUK 12:54-56</a> and may have been inserted from there. It rebukes the Pharisees and Sadducees who are able to read indications of coming weather but not the indications of the coming kingdom in the signs that Jesus does offer, his mighty deeds and teaching."
NABRE,40,16,4,"[3] See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/12/39'>MAT 12:39, 40</a>."
NABRE,40,16,5,"[4] 16:5-12 Jesus warning his disciples against the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadduceescomes immediately before his promise to confer on Peter the authority to bind and to loose on earth (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a>), an authority that will be confirmed in heaven. Such authority most probably has to do, at least in part, with teaching. The rejection of the teaching authority of the Pharisees (see also <a href='/NABRE/40/12/12'>MAT 12:12-14</a>) prepares for a new one derived from Jesus."
NABRE,40,16,6,"[5] Leaven: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/33'>MAT 13:33</a>. Sadducees: Matthews Marcan source speaks rather of ""the leaven of Herod"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/15'>MAK 8:15</a>)."
NABRE,40,16,7,"[6] 16:7-11 The disciples, men of little faith, misunderstand Jesus metaphorical use of leaven, forgetting that, as the feeding of the crowds shows, he is not at a loss to provide them with bread."
NABRE,40,16,12,"[7] After his rebuke, the disciples understand that by leavenhe meant the corrupting influence of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The evangelist probably understands this teachingas common to both groups. Since at the time of Jesus ministry the two differed widely on points of teaching, e.g., the resurrection of the dead, and at the time of the evangelist the Sadducee party was no longer a force in Judaism, the supposed common teaching fits neither period. The disciples eventual understanding of Jesus warning contrasts with their continuing obtuseness in the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/14'>MAK 8:14-21</a>)."
NABRE,40,16,12,"[8] 16:13-20 The Marcan confession of Jesus as Messiah, made by Peter as spokesman for the other disciples (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/27'>MAK 8:27-29</a>; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/42/9/18'>LUK 9:18-20</a>), is modified significantly here. The confession is of Jesus both as Messiahand as Son of the living God(<a href='/NABRE/40/16/16'>MAT 16:16</a>). Jesus response, drawn principally from material peculiar to Matthew, attributes the confession to a divine revelation granted to Peter alone (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/17'>MAT 16:17</a>) and makes him the rockon which Jesus will buildhis church(<a href='/NABRE/40/16/18'>MAT 16:18</a>) and the disciple whose authority in the church on earthwill be confirmed in heaven, i.e., by God (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a>)."

He rebuilt the town of Paneas, naming it Caesareain honor of the emperor, and Philippi(""of Philip"") to distinguish it from the seaport in Samaria that was also called Caesarea. Who do people say that the Son of Man is?: although the question differs from the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/27'>MAK 8:27</a>: ""Who…that I am?""), the meaning is the same, for Jesus here refers to himself as the Son of Man(cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/15'>MAT 16:15</a>)."
NABRE,40,16,14,[10] John the Baptist: see <a href='/NABRE/40/14/2'>MAT 14:2</a>. Elijah: cf. <a href='/NABRE/39/3/23'>MAL 3:23-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/48/10'>SIR 48:10</a>; and see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/4'>MAT 3:4</a>. Jeremiah: an addition of Matthew to the Marcan source.

The addition of this exalted title to the Marcan confession eliminates whatever ambiguity was attached to the title Messiah. This, among other things, supports the view proposed by many scholars that Matthew has here combined his sources confession with a post-resurrectional confession of faith in Jesus as Son of the living Godthat belonged to the appearance of the risen Jesus to Peter; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>1CO 15:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/34'>LUK 24:34</a>."
NABRE,40,16,17,"[12] Flesh and blood: a Semitic expression for human beings, especially in their weakness.

NABRE,40,16,18,"[13] You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church: the Aramaic word kēpāmeaning rockand transliterated into Greek as Kēphasis the name by which Peter is called in the Pauline letters (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/12'>1CO 1:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/3/22'>3:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/5'>9:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/15/4'>15:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/1/18'>GAL 1:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/2/9'>2:9, 11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/2/14'>14</a>) except in <a href='/NABRE/48/2/7'>GAL 2:7-8</a> (""Peter""). It is translated as Petros(""Peter"") in <a href='/NABRE/43/1/42'>JHN 1:42</a>. The presumed original Aramaic of Jesus statement would have been, in English, ""You are the Rock (Kēpā) and upon this rock (kēpā) I will build my church."" The Greek text probably means the same, for the difference in gender between the masculine noun petros, the disciples new name, and the feminine noun petra(rock) may be due simply to the unsuitability of using a feminine noun as the proper name of a male. Although the two words were generally used with slightly different nuances, they were also used interchangeably with the same meaning, ""rock."" Church: this word (Greek ekklēsia) occurs in the gospels only here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/18/17'>MAT 18:17</a> (twice). There are several possibilities for an Aramaic original. Jesus churchmeans the community that he willgather and that, like a building, will have Peter as its solid foundation. That function of Peter consists in his being witness to Jesus as the Messiah, the Son of the living God. The gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it: the netherworld (Greek Hadēs, the abode of the dead) is conceived of as a walled city whose gateswill not close in upon the church of Jesus, i.e., it will not be overcome by the power of death."
NABRE,40,16,19,"[14] The keys to the kingdom of heaven: the image of the keys is probably drawn from <a href='/NABRE/23/22/15'>ISA 22:15-25</a> where Eliakim, who succeeds Shebna as master of the palace, is given ""the key of the House of David,"" which he authoritatively ""opens"" and ""shuts"" (<a href='/NABRE/23/22/22'>ISA 22:22</a>). Whatever you bind…loosed in heaven: there are many instances in rabbinic literature of the binding-loosing imagery. Of the several meanings given there to the metaphor, two are of special importance here: the giving of authoritative teaching, and the lifting or imposing of the ban of excommunication. It is disputed whether the image of the keysand that of binding and loosing are different metaphors meaning the same thing. In any case, the promise of the keys is given to Peter alone. In <a href='/NABRE/40/18/18'>MAT 18:18</a> all the disciples are given the power of binding and loosing, but the context of that verse suggests that there the power of excommunication alone is intended. That the keysare those to the kingdom of heavenand that Peters exercise of authority in the church on earthwill be confirmed in heavenshow an intimate connection between, but not an identification of, the church and the kingdom of heaven."
NABRE,40,16,20,[15] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/8/30'>MAK 8:30</a>. Matthew makes explicit that the prohibition has to do with speaking of Jesus as the Messiah; see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/8/27'>MAK 8:27-30</a>.
NABRE,40,16,20,"[16] 16:21-23 This first prediction of the passion follows <a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31-33</a> in the main and serves as a corrective to an understanding of Jesus messiahship as solely one of glory and triumph. By his addition of from that time on(<a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21</a>) Matthew has emphasized that Jesus revelation of his coming suffering and death marks a new phase of the gospel. Neither this nor the two later passion predictions (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/22'>MAT 17:22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/20/17'>20:17-19</a>) can be taken as sayings that, as they stand, go back to Jesus himself. However, it is probable that he foresaw that his mission would entail suffering and perhaps death, but was confident that he would ultimately be vindicated by God (see <a href='/NABRE/40/26/29'>MAT 26:29</a>)."
NABRE,40,16,21,"[17] He: the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31</a>) has ""the Son of Man."" Since Matthew has already designated Jesus by that title (<a href='/NABRE/40/15/13'>MAT 15:13</a>), its omission here is not significant. The Matthean prediction is equally about the sufferings of the Son of Man. Must: this necessity is part of the tradition of all the synoptics; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/9/21'>LUK 9:21</a>. The elders, the chief priests, and the scribes: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31</a>. On the third day: so also <a href='/NABRE/42/9/22'>LUK 9:22</a>, against the Marcan ""after three days"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31</a>). Matthews formulation is, in the Greek, almost identical with the pre-Pauline fragment of the kerygma in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/4'>1CO 15:4</a> and also with <a href='/NABRE/28/6/2'>HOS 6:2</a>, which many take to be the Old Testament background to the confession that Jesus was raised on the third day. Josephus uses ""after three days"" and ""on the third day"" interchangeably (Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/40/7/280'>7:280-81</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/8/214'>8:214, 218</a>) and there is probably no difference in meaning between the two phrases."
NABRE,40,16,22,"[18] 16:22-23 Peters refusal to accept Jesus predicted suffering and death is seen as a satanic attempt to deflect Jesus from his God-appointed course, and the disciple is addressed in terms that recall Jesus dismissal of the devil in the temptation account (<a href='/NABRE/40/4/10'>MAT 4:10</a>: ""Get away, Satan!""). Peters satanic purpose is emphasized by Matthews addition to the Marcan source of the words You are an obstacle to me."
NABRE,40,16,23,[19] 16:24-28 A readiness to follow Jesus even to giving up ones life for him is the condition for true discipleship; this will be repaid by him at the final judgment.
NABRE,40,16,24,[20] Deny himself: to deny someone is to disown him (see <a href='/NABRE/40/10/33'>MAT 10:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/34'>26:34-35</a>) and to deny oneself is to disown oneself as the center of ones existence.

NABRE,40,16,27,[22] The parousia and final judgment are described in <a href='/NABRE/40/25/31'>MAT 25:31</a> in terms almost identical with these.
NABRE,40,16,28,"[23] Coming in his kingdom: since the kingdom of the Son of Manhas been described as ""the world"" and Jesus sovereignty precedes his final coming in glory (<a href='/NABRE/40/13/38'>MAT 13:38, 41</a>), the coming in this verse is not the parousia as in the preceding but the manifestation of Jesus rule after his resurrection; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/38'>MAT 13:38, 41</a>."
NABRE,40,17,1,"[1] 17:1-8 The account of the transfiguration confirms that Jesus is the Sonof God (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/5'>MAT 17:5</a>) and points to fulfillment of the prediction that he will come in his Fathers gloryat the end of the age (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/27'>MAT 16:27</a>). It has been explained by some as a resurrection appearance retrojected into the time of Jesus ministry, but that is not probable since the account lacks many of the usual elements of the resurrection-appearance narratives. It draws upon motifs from the Old Testament and noncanonical Jewish apocalyptic literature that express the presence of the heavenly and the divine, e.g., brilliant light, white garments, and the overshadowing cloud."
NABRE,40,17,1,"[2] These three disciples are also taken apart from the others by Jesus in Gethsemane (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/37'>MAT 26:37</a>). A high mountain: this has been identified with Tabor or Hermon, but probably no specific mountain was intended by the evangelist or by his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/2'>MAK 9:2</a>). Its meaning is theological rather than geographical, possibly recalling the revelation to Moses on Mount Sinai (<a href='/NABRE/2/24/12'>EXO 24:12-18</a>) and to Elijah at the same place (<a href='/NABRE/11/19/8'>1KG 19:8-18</a>; Horeb = Sinai)."

The same Greek word, skēnē, here translated tents, is used in the LXX for the booths of that feast, and some scholars have suggested that there is an allusion here to that liturgical custom."

The voice repeats the baptismal proclamation about Jesus, with the addition of the command listen to him. The latter is a reference to <a href='/NABRE/5/18/15'>DEU 18:15</a> in which the Israelites are commanded to listen tothe prophet like Moses whom God will raise up for them. The command to listen to Jesus is general, but in this context it probably applies particularly to the preceding predictions of his passion and resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21</a>) and of his coming (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/27'>MAT 16:27, 28</a>)."

NABRE,40,17,8,"[8] 17:9-13 In response to the disciples question about the expected return of Elijah, Jesus interprets the mission of the Baptist as the fulfillment of that expectation. But that was not suspected by those who opposed and finally killed him, and Jesus predicts a similar fate for himself."
NABRE,40,17,9,[9] The vision: Matthew alone uses this word to describe the transfiguration. Until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead: only in the light of Jesus resurrection can the meaning of his life and mission be truly understood; until then no testimony to the visionwill lead people to faith.

NABRE,40,17,11,[11] 17:11-12 The preceding question and this answer may reflect later controversy with Jews who objected to the Christian claims for Jesus that Elijah had not yet come.

NABRE,40,17,13,"[13] 17:14-20 Matthew has greatly shortened the Marcan story (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/14'>MAK 9:14-29</a>). Leaving aside several details of the boys illness, he concentrates on the need for faith, not so much on the part of the boys father (as does Mark, for Matthew omits <a href='/NABRE/41/9/22'>MAK 9:22</a>b-24) but on that of his own disciples whose inability to drive out the demon is ascribed to their little faith(<a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>)."
NABRE,40,17,15,"[14] A lunatic: this description of the boy is peculiar to Matthew. The word occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/4/24'>MAT 4:24</a> and means one affected or struck by the moon. The symptoms of the boys illness point to epilepsy, and attacks of this were thought to be caused by phases of the moon."

The Greek word here translated perverseis the same as that in <a href='/NABRE/5/32/5'>DEU 32:5</a> LXX, where Moses speaks to his people. There is a problem in knowing to whom the reproach is addressed. Since the Matthean Jesus normally chides his disciples for their little faith(as in <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>), it would appear that the charge of lack of faith could not be made against them and that the reproach is addressed to unbelievers among the Jews. However in <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>b (if you have faith the size of a mustard seed), which is certainly addressed to the disciples, they appear to have not even the smallest faith; if they had, they would have been able to cure the boy. In the light of <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>b the reproach of <a href='/NABRE/40/17/17'>MAT 17:17</a> could have applied to the disciples. There seems to be an inconsistency between the charge of little faithin <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>a and that of not even a little in <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>b."
NABRE,40,17,18,[16] The demon came out of him: not until this verse does Matthew indicate that the boys illness is a case of demoniacal possession.
NABRE,40,17,20,[17] The entire verse is an addition of Matthew who (according to the better attested text) omits the reason given for the disciples inability in <a href='/NABRE/41/9/29'>MAK 9:29</a>. Little faith: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/6/30'>MAT 6:30</a>. Faith the size of a mustard seed…and it will move: a combination of a Q saying (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/17/6'>LUK 17:6</a>) with a Marcan saying (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/11/23'>MAK 11:23</a>).
NABRE,40,17,21,"[18] Some manuscripts add, ""But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting""; this is a variant of the better reading of <a href='/NABRE/41/9/29'>MAK 9:29</a>."
NABRE,40,17,21,[19] 17:22-23 The second passion prediction (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21-23</a>) is the least detailed of the three and may be the earliest. In the Marcan parallel the disciples do not understand (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/32'>MAK 9:32</a>); here they understand and are overwhelmed with griefat the prospect of Jesus death (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/23'>MAT 17:23</a>).
NABRE,40,17,23,"[20] 17:24-27 Like <a href='/NABRE/40/14/28'>MAT 14:28-31</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/16/16'>MAT 16:16</a>b-19, this episode comes from Matthews special material on Peter. Although the question of the collectorsconcerns Jesus payment of the temple tax, it is put to Peter. It is he who receives instruction from Jesus about freedom from the obligation of payment and yet why it should be made. The means of doing so is provided miraculously. The pericope deals with a problem of Matthews church, whether its members should pay the temple tax, and the answer is given through a word of Jesus conveyed to Peter. Some scholars see here an example of the teaching authority of Peter exercised in the name of Jesus (see <a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a>). The specific problem was a Jewish Christian one and may have arisen when the Matthean church was composed largely of that group."
NABRE,40,17,24,[21] The temple tax: before the destruction of the Jerusalem temple in A.D. 70 every male Jew above nineteen years of age was obliged to make an annual contribution to its upkeep (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/30/11'>EXO 30:11-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/10/33'>NEH 10:33</a>). After the destruction the Romans imposed upon Jews the obligation of paying that tax for the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus. There is disagreement about which period the story deals with.
NABRE,40,17,25,"[22] From their subjects or from foreigners?: the Greek word here translated subjectsliterally means ""sons."""
NABRE,40,17,26,"[23] Then the subjects are exempt: just as subjectsare not bound by laws applying to foreigners, neither are Jesus and his disciples, who belong to the kingdom of heaven, bound by the duty of paying the temple tax imposed on those who are not of the kingdom. If the Greek is translated ""sons,"" the freedom of Jesus, the Son of God, and of his disciples, children (""sons"") of the kingdom (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/13/38'>MAT 13:38</a>), is even more clear."
NABRE,40,17,27,"[24] That we may not offend them: though they are exempt (<a href='/NABRE/40/17/26'>MAT 17:26</a>), Jesus and his disciples are to avoid giving offense; therefore the tax is to be paid. A coin worth twice the temple tax: literally, ""a stater,"" a Greek coin worth two double drachmas. Two double drachmas were equal to the Jewish shekel and the tax was a half-shekel. For me and for you: not only Jesus but Peter pays the tax, and this example serves as a standard for the conduct of all the disciples."
NABRE,40,18,1,"[1] The initiative is taken not by Jesus as in the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/33'>MAK 9:33-34</a>) but by the disciples. Kingdom of heaven: this may mean the kingdomin its fullness, i.e., after the parousia and the final judgment. But what follows about causes of sin, church discipline, and forgiveness, all dealing with the present age, suggests that the question has to do with rank also in the church, where the kingdom is manifested here and now, although only partially and by anticipation; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/4/17'>4:17</a>."
NABRE,40,18,3,"[2] Become like children: the child is held up as a model for the disciples not because of any supposed innocence of children but because of their complete dependence on, and trust in, their parents. So must the disciples be, in respect to God."
NABRE,40,18,5,[3] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/10/40'>MAT 10:40</a>.
NABRE,40,18,6,"[4] One of these little ones: the thought passes from the child of <a href='/NABRE/40/18/2'>MAT 18:2-4</a> to the disciples, little onesbecause of their becoming like children. It is difficult to know whether this is a designation of all who are disciples or of those who are insignificant in contrast to others, e.g., the leaders of the community. Since apart from this chapter the designation little onesoccurs in Matthew only in <a href='/NABRE/40/10/42'>MAT 10:42</a> where it means disciples as such, that is its more likely meaning here. Who believe in me: since discipleship is impossible without at least some degree of faith, this further specification seems superfluous. However, it serves to indicate that the warning against causing a little oneto sin is principally directed against whatever would lead such a one to a weakening or loss of faith. The Greek verb skandalizein, here translated causes…to sin, means literally ""causes to stumble""; what the stumbling is depends on the context. It is used of falling away from faith in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/21'>MAT 13:21</a>. According to the better reading of <a href='/NABRE/41/9/42'>MAK 9:42</a>, in meis a Matthean addition to the Marcan source. It would be better…depths of the sea: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/9/42'>MAK 9:42</a>."
NABRE,40,18,7,"[5] This is a Q saying; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/17/1'>LUK 17:1</a>. The inevitability of things that cause sin(literally, ""scandals"") does not take away the responsibility of the one through whom they come."
NABRE,40,18,8,"[6] 18:8-9 These verses are a doublet of <a href='/NABRE/40/5/29'>MAT 5:29-30</a>. In that context they have to do with causes of sexual sin. As in the Marcan source from which they have been drawn (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/42'>MAK 9:42-48</a>), they differ from the first warning about scandal, which deals with causing another person to sin, for they concern what causesoneself to sinand they do not seem to be related to anothers loss of faith, as the first warning is. It is difficult to know how Matthew understood the logical connection between these verses and <a href='/NABRE/40/18/6'>MAT 18:6-7</a>."
NABRE,40,18,9,"[7] 18:10-14 The first and last verses are peculiar to Matthew. The parable itself comes from Q; see <a href='/NABRE/42/15/3'>LUK 15:3-7</a>. In Luke it serves as justification for Jesus table-companionship with sinners; here, it is an exhortation for the disciples to seek out fellow disciples who have gone astray. Not only must no one cause a fellow disciple to sin, but those who have strayed must be sought out and, if possible, brought back to the community. The joy of the shepherd on finding the sheep, though not absent in <a href='/NABRE/40/18/13'>MAT 18:13</a> is more emphasized in Luke. By his addition of <a href='/NABRE/40/18/10'>MAT 18:10, 14</a> Matthew has drawn out explicitly the application of the parable to the care of the little ones."
NABRE,40,18,10,"[8] Their angels in heaven…my heavenly Father: for the Jewish belief in angels as guardians of nations and individuals, see <a href='/NABRE/27/10/13'>DAN 10:13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/10/20'>20-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/5/4'>TOB 5:4-7</a>; 1QH 5:20-22; as intercessors who present the prayers of human beings to God, see <a href='/NABRE/68/13/12'>TOB 13:12, 15</a>. The high worth of the little onesis indicated by their being represented before God by these heavenly beings."
NABRE,40,18,11,"[9] Some manuscripts add, ""For the Son of Man has come to save what was lost""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/9/13'>MAT 9:13</a>. This is practically identical with <a href='/NABRE/42/19/10'>LUK 19:10</a> and is probably a copyists addition from that source."
NABRE,40,18,14,"[10] 18:15-20 Passing from the duty of Christian disciples toward those who have strayed from their number, the discourse now turns to how they are to deal with one who sins and yet remains within the community. First there is to be private correction (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/15'>MAT 18:15</a>); if this is unsuccessful, further correction before two or three witnesses(<a href='/NABRE/40/18/16'>MAT 18:16</a>); if this fails, the matter is to be brought before the assembled community (the church), and if the sinner refuses to attend to the correction of the church, he is to be expelled (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/17'>MAT 18:17</a>). The churchs judgment will be ratified in heaven, i.e., by God (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/18'>MAT 18:18</a>). This three-step process of correction corresponds, though not exactly, to the procedure of the Qumran community; see 1QS 5:25-6:1; 6:24-7:25; CD 9:2-8. The section ends with a saying about the favorable response of God to prayer, even to that of a very small number, for Jesus is in the midst of any gathering of his disciples, however small (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/19'>MAT 18:19-20</a>). Whether this prayer has anything to do with the preceding judgment is uncertain."
NABRE,40,18,15,"[11] Your brother: a fellow disciple; see <a href='/NABRE/40/23/8'>MAT 23:8</a>. The bracketed words, against you, are widely attested but they are not in the important codices Sinaiticus and Vaticanus or in some other textual witnesses. Their omission broadens the type of sin in question. Won over: literally, ""gained."""
NABRE,40,18,16,[12] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/19/15'>DEU 19:15</a>.
NABRE,40,18,17,"[13] The church: the second of the only two instances of this word in the gospels; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/18'>MAT 16:18</a>. Here it refers not to the entire churchof Jesus, as in <a href='/NABRE/40/16/18'>MAT 16:18</a>, but to the local congregation. Treat him…a Gentile or a tax collector: just as the observant Jew avoided the company of Gentiles and tax collectors, so must the congregation of Christian disciples separate itself from the arrogantly sinful member who refuses to repent even when convicted of his sin by the whole church. Such a one is to be set outside the fellowship of the community. The harsh language about Gentileand tax collectorprobably reflects a stage of the Matthean churchwhen it was principally composed of Jewish Christians. That time had long since passed, but the principle of exclusion for such a sinner remained. Paul makes a similar demand for excommunication in <a href='/NABRE/46/5/1'>1CO 5:1-13</a>."
NABRE,40,18,18,"[14] Except for the plural of the verbs bindand loose, this verse is practically identical with <a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a>b and many scholars understand it as granting to all the disciples what was previously given to Peter alone. For a different view, based on the different contexts of the two verses, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a>."
NABRE,40,18,19,"[15] 18:19-20 Some take these verses as applying to prayer on the occasion of the churchs gathering to deal with the sinner of <a href='/NABRE/40/18/17'>MAT 18:17</a>. Unless an a fortioriargument is supposed, this seems unlikely. Gods answer to the prayer of two or threeenvisages a different situation from one that involves the entire congregation. In addition, the object of this prayer is expressed in most general terms as anything for which they are to pray."
NABRE,40,18,20,"[16] For where two or three…midst of them: the presence of Jesus guarantees the efficacy of the prayer. This saying is similar to one attributed to a rabbi executed in A.D. 135 at the time of the second Jewish revolt: ""…When two sit and there are between them the words of the Torah, the divine presence (Shekinah) rests upon them"" (Pirqê Abôt3, 3)."
NABRE,40,18,20,"[17] 18:21-35 The final section of the discourse deals with the forgiveness that the disciples are to give to their fellow disciples who sin against them. To the question of Peter how often forgiveness is to be granted (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/21'>MAT 18:21</a>), Jesus answers that it is to be given without limit (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/22'>MAT 18:22</a>) and illustrates this with the parable of the unmerciful servant (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/23'>MAT 18:23-34</a>), warning that his heavenly Fatherwill give those who do not forgive the same treatment as that given to the unmerciful servant (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/35'>MAT 18:35</a>). <a href='/NABRE/40/18/21'>MAT 18:21-22</a> correspond to <a href='/NABRE/42/17/4'>LUK 17:4</a>; the parable and the final warning are peculiar to Matthew. That the parable did not originally belong to this context is suggested by the fact that it really does not deal with repeated forgiveness, which is the point of Peters question and Jesus reply."
NABRE,40,18,22,"[18] Seventy-seven times: the Greek corresponds exactly to the LXX of <a href='/NABRE/1/4/24'>GEN 4:24</a>. There is probably an allusion, by contrast, to the limitless vengeance of Lamech in the Genesis text. In any case, what is demanded of the disciples is limitless forgiveness."
NABRE,40,18,24,"[19] A huge amount: literally, ""ten thousand talents."" The talent was a unit of coinage of high but varying value depending on its metal (gold, silver, copper) and its place of origin. It is mentioned in the New Testament only here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/25/14'>MAT 25:14-30</a>."
NABRE,40,18,26,"[20] Pay you back in full: an empty promise, given the size of the debt."
NABRE,40,18,28,"[21] A much smaller amount: literally, ""a hundred denarii."" A denarius was the normal daily wage of a laborer. The difference between the two debts is enormous and brings out the absurdity of the conduct of the Christian who has received the great forgiveness of God and yet refuses to forgive the relatively minor offenses done to him."
NABRE,40,18,34,"[22] Since the debt is so great as to be unpayable, the punishment will be endless."
NABRE,40,18,35,"[23] The Fathers forgiveness, already given, will be withdrawn at the final judgment for those who have not imitated his forgiveness by their own."
NABRE,40,19,1,"[1] 19:1-23:39 The narrative section of the fifth book of the gospel. The first part (<a href='/NABRE/40/19/1'>MAT 19:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/20/34'>20:34</a>) has for its setting the journey of Jesus from Galilee to Jerusalem; the second (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/1'>MAT 21:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/23/39'>23:39</a>) deals with Jesus ministry in Jerusalem up to the final great discourse of the gospel (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>MAT 24</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/25/1'>25</a>). Matthew follows the Marcan sequence of events, though adding material both special to this gospel and drawn from Q. The second part ends with the denunciation of the scribes and Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/1'>MAT 23:1-36</a>) followed by Jesus lament over Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/37'>MAT 23:37-39</a>). This long and important speech raises a problem for the view that Matthew is structured around five other discourses of Jesus (see Introduction) and that this one has no such function in the gospel. However, it is to be noted that this speech lacks the customary concluding formula that follows the five discourses (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/7/28'>MAT 7:28</a>), and that those discourses are all addressed either exclusively (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/1'>MAT 10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/18/1'>18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>24</a>; 25) or primarily (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>MAT 5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/7/1'>7</a>; 13) to the disciples, whereas this is addressed primarily to the scribes and Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/13'>MAT 23:13-36</a>). Consequently, it seems plausible to maintain that the evangelist did not intend to give it the structural importance of the five other discourses, and that, in spite of its being composed of sayings-material, it belongs to the narrative section of this book. In that regard, it is similar to the sayings-material of <a href='/NABRE/40/11/7'>MAT 11:7-30</a>. Some have proposed that Matthew wished to regard it as part of the final discourse of <a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>MAT 24</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/25/1'>25</a>, but the intervening material (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>MAT 24:1-4</a>) and the change in matter and style of those chapters do not support that view."
NABRE,40,19,1,"[2] In giving Jesus teaching on divorce (<a href='/NABRE/40/19/3'>MAT 19:3-9</a>), Matthew here follows his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/2'>MAK 10:2-12</a>) as he does Q in <a href='/NABRE/40/5/31'>MAT 5:31-32</a> (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/16/18'>LUK 16:18</a>). <a href='/NABRE/40/19/10'>MAT 19:10-12</a> are peculiar to Matthew."
NABRE,40,19,1,[3] When Jesus finished these words: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/7/28'>MAT 7:28-29</a>. The district of Judea across the Jordan: an inexact designation of the territory. Judea did not extend across the Jordan; the territory east of the river was Perea. The route to Jerusalem by way of Perea avoided passage through Samaria.
NABRE,40,19,3,"[4] Tested him: the verb is used of attempts of Jesus opponents to embarrass him by challenging him to do something they think impossible (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/1'>MAT 16:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/8/11'>MAK 8:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/11/16'>LUK 11:16</a>) or by having him say something that they can use against him (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/18'>MAT 22:18, 35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/10/2'>MAK 10:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/12/15'>12:15</a>). For any cause whatever: this is peculiar to Matthew and has been interpreted by some as meaning that Jesus was being asked to take sides in the dispute between the schools of Hillel and Shammai on the reasons for divorce, the latter holding a stricter position than the former. It is unlikely, however, that to ask Jesus opinion about the differing views of two Jewish schools, both highly respected, could be described as ""testing"" him, for the reason indicated above."
NABRE,40,19,4,"[5] 19:4-6 Matthew recasts his Marcan source, omitting Jesus question about Moses command (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/3'>MAK 10:3</a>) and having him recall at once two Genesis texts that show the will and purpose of the Creatorin making human beings male and female(<a href='/NABRE/1/1/27'>GEN 1:27</a>), namely, that a manmay be joined to his wifein marriage in the intimacy of one flesh(<a href='/NABRE/1/2/24'>GEN 2:24</a>). What God hasthus joinedmust not be separated by any human being. (The NAB translation of the Hebrew bāśārof <a href='/NABRE/1/2/24'>GEN 2:24</a> as ""body"" rather than ""flesh"" obscures the reference of Matthew to that text.)"
NABRE,40,19,7,[6] See <a href='/NABRE/5/24/1'>DEU 24:1-4</a>.
NABRE,40,19,9,"[7] Moses concession to human sinfulness (the hardness of your hearts, <a href='/NABRE/40/19/8'>MAT 19:8</a>) is repudiated by Jesus, and the original will of the Creator is reaffirmed against that concession. (Unless the marriage is unlawful): see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/5/31'>MAT 5:31-32</a>. There is some evidence suggesting that Jesus absolute prohibition of divorce was paralleled in the Qumran community (see 11QTemple <a href='/NABRE/40/57/17'>57:17-19</a>; CD 4:12b-5:14). Matthew removes Marks setting of this verse as spoken to the disciples alone ""in the house"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/10'>MAK 10:10</a>) and also his extension of the divorce prohibition to the case of a womans divorcing her husband (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/12'>MAK 10:12</a>), probably because in Palestine, unlike the places where Roman and Greek law prevailed, the woman was not allowed to initiate the divorce."
NABRE,40,19,11,"[8] [This] word: probably the disciples ""it is better not to marry""(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/10'>MAT 19:10</a>). Jesus agrees but says that celibacy is not for all but only for those to whom that is grantedby God."
NABRE,40,19,12,"[9] Incapable of marriage: literally, ""eunuchs."" Three classes are mentioned, eunuchs from birth, eunuchs by castration, and those who have voluntarily renounced marriage(literally, ""have made themselves eunuchs"") for the sake of the kingdom, i.e., to devote themselves entirely to its service. Some scholars take the last class to be those who have been divorced by their spouses and have refused to enter another marriage. But it is more likely that it is rather those who have chosen never to marry, since that suits better the optional nature of the decision: whoever can…ought to accept it."
NABRE,40,19,12,"[10] 19:13-15 This account is understood by some as intended to justify the practice of infant baptism. That interpretation is based principally on the command not to preventthe children from coming, since that word sometimes has a baptismal connotation in the New Testament; see <a href='/NABRE/44/8/36'>ACT 8:36</a>."
NABRE,40,19,15,"[11] 19:16-30 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/10/17'>MAK 10:17-31</a>. This story does not set up a ""two-tier"" morality, that of those who seek (only) eternal life(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/16'>MAT 19:16</a>) and that of those who wish to be perfect(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/21'>MAT 19:21</a>). It speaks rather of the obstacle that riches constitute for the following of Jesus and of the impossibility, humanly speaking, for one who has many possessions(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/22'>MAT 19:22</a>) to enter the kingdom(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/24'>MAT 19:24</a>). Actual renunciation of riches is not demanded of all; Matthew counts the rich Joseph of Arimathea as a disciple of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/57'>MAT 27:57</a>). But only the poor in spirit (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3</a>) can enter the kingdomand, as here, such poverty may entail the sacrifice of ones possessions. The Twelve, who have given up everything(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/27'>MAT 19:27</a>) to follow Jesus, will have as their reward a share in Jesus (the Son of Mans) judging the twelve tribes of Israel(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/28'>MAT 19:28</a>), and all who have similarly sacrificed family or property for his sake will inherit eternal life(<a href='/NABRE/40/19/29'>MAT 19:29</a>)."
NABRE,40,19,16,"[12] Gain eternal life: this is equivalent to ""entering into life"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/19/17'>MAT 19:17</a>) and ""being saved"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/19/25'>MAT 19:25</a>); the lifeis that of the new age after the final judgment (see <a href='/NABRE/40/25/46'>MAT 25:46</a>). It probably is also equivalent here to ""entering the kingdom of heaven"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/19/23'>MAT 19:23</a>) or ""the kingdom of God"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/19/24'>MAT 19:24</a>), but see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/4/17'>4:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/18/1'>18:1</a> for the wider reference of the kingdomin Matthew."
NABRE,40,19,17,"[13] By Matthews reformulation of the Marcan question and reply (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/17'>MAK 10:17-18</a>) Jesus repudiation of the term ""good"" for himself has been softened. Yet the Marcan assertion that ""no one is good but God alone"" stands, with only unimportant verbal modification."
NABRE,40,19,18,"[14] 19:18-19 The first five commandments cited are from the Decalogue (see <a href='/NABRE/2/20/12'>EXO 20:12-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/5/16'>DEU 5:16-20</a>). Matthew omits Marks ""you shall not defraud"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/19'>MAK 10:19</a>; see <a href='/NABRE/5/24/14'>DEU 24:14</a>) and adds <a href='/NABRE/3/19/18'>LEV 19:18</a>. This combination of commandments of the Decalogue with <a href='/NABRE/3/19/18'>LEV 19:18</a> is partially the same as Pauls enumeration of the demands of Christian morality in <a href='/NABRE/45/13/9'>ROM 13:9</a>."
NABRE,40,19,20,"[15] Young man: in Matthew alone of the synoptics the questioner is said to be a young man; thus the Marcan ""from my youth"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/20'>MAK 10:20</a>) is omitted."
NABRE,40,19,21,"[16] If you wish to be perfect: to be perfectis demanded of all Christians; see <a href='/NABRE/40/5/48'>MAT 5:48</a>. In the case of this man, it involves selling his possessions and giving to the poor; only so can he followJesus."
NABRE,40,19,23,"[17] 19:23-24 Riches are an obstacle to entering the kingdomthat cannot be overcome by human power. The comparison with the impossibility of a camels passing through the eye of a needleshould not be mitigated by such suppositions as that the eye of a needlemeans a low or narrow gate. The kingdom of God: as in <a href='/NABRE/40/12/28'>MAT 12:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/21/31'>21:31, 43</a> instead of Matthews usual kingdom of heaven."
NABRE,40,19,25,[18] 19:25-26 See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/10/23'>MAK 10:23-27</a>.
NABRE,40,19,28,"[19] This saying, directed to the Twelve, is from Q; see <a href='/NABRE/42/22/29'>LUK 22:29-30</a>. The new age: the Greek word here translated ""new age"" occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href='/NABRE/56/3/5'>TIT 3:5</a>. Literally, it means ""rebirth"" or ""regeneration,"" and is used in Titus of spiritual rebirth through baptism. Here it means the ""rebirth"" effected by the coming of the kingdom. Since that coming has various stages (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/4/17'>4:17</a>), the new agecould be taken as referring to the time after the resurrection when the Twelve will govern the true Israel, i.e., the church of Jesus. (For ""judge"" in the sense of ""govern,"" cf. <a href='/NABRE/7/12/8'>JUG 12:8, 9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/7/12/11'>11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/15/20'>15:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/7/16/31'>16:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/2/10'>PS 2:10</a>). But since it is connected here with the time when the Son of Manwill be seated on his throne of glory, language that Matthew uses in <a href='/NABRE/40/25/31'>MAT 25:31</a> for the time of final judgment, it is more likely that what the Twelve are promised is that they will be joined with Jesus then in judging the people of Israel."
NABRE,40,19,30,"[20] Different interpretations have been given to this saying, which comes from <a href='/NABRE/41/10/31'>MAK 10:31</a>. In view of Matthews associating it with the following parable (<a href='/NABRE/40/20/1'>MAT 20:1-15</a>) and substantially repeating it (in reverse order) at the end of that parable (<a href='/NABRE/40/20/16'>MAT 20:16</a>), it may be that his meaning is that all who respond to the call of Jesus, at whatever time (firstor last), will be the same in respect to inheriting the benefits of the kingdom, which is the gift of God."
NABRE,40,20,1,"[1] 20:1-16 This parable is peculiar to Matthew. It is difficult to know whether the evangelist composed it or received it as part of his traditional material and, if the latter is the case, what its original reference was. In its present context its close association with <a href='/NABRE/40/19/30'>MAT 19:30</a> suggests that its teaching is the equality of all the disciples in the reward of inheriting eternal life."
NABRE,40,20,4,"[2] What is just: although the wage is not stipulated as in the case of those first hired, it will be fair."
NABRE,40,20,8,[3] Beginning with the last…the first: this element of the parable has no other purpose than to show how the firstknew what the lastwere given (<a href='/NABRE/40/20/12'>MAT 20:12</a>).
NABRE,40,20,13,"[4] I am not cheating you: literally, ""I am not treating you unjustly."""
NABRE,40,20,14,"[5] 20:14-15 The owners conduct involves no violation of justice (<a href='/NABRE/40/20/4'>MAT 20:4, 13</a>), and that all the workers receive the same wage is due only to his generosity to the latest arrivals; the resentment of the first comes from envy."
NABRE,40,20,16,[6] See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/19/30'>MAT 19:30</a>.
NABRE,40,20,16,"[7] 20:17-19 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/10/32'>MAK 10:32-34</a>. This is the third and the most detailed of the passion predictions (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/17/22'>17:22-23</a>). It speaks of Jesus being handed over to the Gentiles(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/2'>MAT 27:2</a>), his being mocked(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/27'>MAT 27:27-30</a>), scourged(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/26'>MAT 27:26</a>), and crucified(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/31'>MAT 27:31, 35</a>). In all but the last of these points Matthew agrees with his Marcan source, but whereas Mark speaks of Jesus being killed (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/34'>MAK 10:34</a>), Matthew has the specific to be…crucified."
NABRE,40,20,19,"[8] 20:20-28 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/10/35'>MAK 10:35-45</a>. The request of the sons of Zebedee, made through their mother, for the highest places of honor in the kingdom, and the indignation of theother tendisciples at this request, show that neither the two brothersnor the others have understood that what makes for greatness in the kingdom is not lordly power but humble service. Jesus gives the example, and his ministry of service will reach its highest point when he gives his life for the deliverance of the human race from sin."
NABRE,40,20,20,[9] 20:20-21 The reason for Matthews making the motherthe petitioner (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/10/35'>MAK 10:35</a>) is not clear. Possibly he intends an allusion to Bathshebas seeking the kingdom for Solomon; see <a href='/NABRE/11/1/11'>1KG 1:11-21</a>. Your kingdom: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/28'>MAT 16:28</a>.
NABRE,40,20,22,"[10] You do not know what you are asking: the Greek verbs are plural and, with the rest of the verse, indicate that the answer is addressed not to the woman but to her sons. Drink the cup: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/10/38'>MAK 10:38-40</a>. Matthew omits the Marcan ""or be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/38'>MAK 10:38</a>)."
NABRE,40,20,28,"[11] Ransom: this noun, which occurs in the New Testament only here and in the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/45'>MAK 10:45</a>), does not necessarily express the idea of liberation by payment of some price. The cognate verb is used frequently in the LXX of Gods liberating Israel from Egypt or from Babylonia after the Exile; see <a href='/NABRE/2/6/6'>EXO 6:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/15/13'>15:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/77/16'>PS 77:16</a> (76 LXX); <a href='/NABRE/23/43/1'>ISA 43:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/44/22'>44:22</a>. The liberation brought by Jesus death will be for many; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>ISA 53:12</a>. Manydoes not mean that some are excluded, but is a Semitism designating the collectivity who benefit from the service of the one, and is equivalent to ""all."" While there are few verbal contacts between this saying and the fourth Servant Song (<a href='/NABRE/23/52/13'>ISA 52:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>53:12</a>), the ideas of that passage are reflected here."
NABRE,40,20,28,"[12] 20:29-34 The cure of the blind men is probably symbolic of what will happen to the disciples, now blind to the meaning of Jesus passion and to the necessity of their sharing his suffering. As the men are given sight, so, after the resurrection, will the disciples come to see that to which they are now blind. Matthew has abbreviated his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/46'>MAK 10:46-52</a>) and has made Marks one man two. Such doubling is characteristic of this gospel; see <a href='/NABRE/40/8/28'>MAT 8:28-34</a> (|| <a href='/NABRE/41/5/1'>MAK 5:1-20</a>) and the note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/27'>MAT 9:27-31</a>."
NABRE,40,20,30,"[13] [Lord,]: some important textual witnesses omit this, but that may be because copyists assimilated this verse to <a href='/NABRE/40/9/27'>MAT 9:27</a>. Son of David: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/27'>MAT 9:27</a>."
NABRE,40,21,1,"[1] 21:1-11 Jesus coming to Jerusalem is in accordance with the divine will that he must go there (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21</a>) to suffer, die, and be raised. He prepares for his entry into the city in such a way as to make it a fulfillment of the prophecy of <a href='/NABRE/38/9/9'>ZEC 9:9</a> (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/2'>MAT 21:2</a>) that emphasizes the humility of the kingwho comes(<a href='/NABRE/40/21/5'>MAT 21:5</a>). That prophecy, absent from the Marcan parallel account (<a href='/NABRE/41/11/1'>MAK 11:1-11</a>) although found also in the Johannine account of the entry (<a href='/NABRE/43/12/15'>JHN 12:15</a>), is the center of the Matthean story. During the procession from Bethphage to Jerusalem, Jesus is acclaimed as the Davidic messianic king by the crowds who accompany him (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/9'>MAT 21:9</a>). On his arrival the whole city was shaken, and to the inquiry of the amazed populace about Jesus identity the crowds with him reply that he is the prophet, from Nazareth in Galilee(<a href='/NABRE/40/21/10'>MAT 21:10, 11</a>)."
NABRE,40,21,1,"[2] Bethphage: a village that can no longer be certainly identified. Mark mentions it before Bethany (<a href='/NABRE/41/11/1'>MAK 11:1</a>), which suggests that it lay to the east of the latter. The Mount of Olives: the hill east of Jerusalem that is spoken of in <a href='/NABRE/38/14/4'>ZEC 14:4</a> as the place where the Lord will come to rescue Jerusalem from the enemy nations."
NABRE,40,21,2,"[3] An ass tethered, and a colt with her: instead of the one animal of <a href='/NABRE/41/11/2'>MAK 11:2</a>, Matthew has two, as demanded by his understanding of <a href='/NABRE/38/9/9'>ZEC 9:9</a>."
NABRE,40,21,4,"[4] 21:4-5 The prophet: this fulfillment citation is actually composed of two distinct Old Testament texts, <a href='/NABRE/23/62/11'>ISA 62:11</a> (Say to daughter Zion) and <a href='/NABRE/38/9/9'>ZEC 9:9</a>. The assand the coltare the same animal in the prophecy, mentioned twice in different ways, the common Hebrew literary device of poetic parallelism. That Matthew takes them as two is one of the reasons why some scholars think that he was a Gentile rather than a Jewish Christian who would presumably not make that mistake (see Introduction)."
NABRE,40,21,7,[5] Upon them: upon the two animals; an awkward picture resulting from Matthews misunderstanding of the prophecy.
NABRE,40,21,8,[6] Spread…on the road: cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/9/13'>2KG 9:13</a>. There is a similarity between the cutting and strewing of the branches and the festivities of Tabernacles (<a href='/NABRE/3/23/39'>LEV 23:39-40</a>); see also <a href='/NABRE/75/10/5'>2MA 10:5-8</a> where the celebration of the rededication of the temple is compared to that of Tabernacles.
NABRE,40,21,9,"[7] Hosanna: the Hebrew means ""(O Lord) grant salvation""; see <a href='/NABRE/19/118/25'>PS 118:25</a>, but that invocation had become an acclamation of jubilation and welcome. Blessed is he…in the name of the Lord: see <a href='/NABRE/19/118/26'>PS 118:26</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/43/12/13'>JHN 12:13</a>. In the highest: probably only an intensification of the acclamation, although Hosanna in the highestcould be taken as a prayer, ""May God save (him)."""
NABRE,40,21,10,"[8] Was shaken: in the gospels this verb is peculiar to Matthew where it is used also of the earthquake at the time of the crucifixion (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/51'>MAT 27:51</a>) and of the terror of the guards of Jesus tomb at the appearance of the angel (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/4'>MAT 28:4</a>). For Matthews use of the cognate noun, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/24'>MAT 8:24</a>."
NABRE,40,21,11,"[9] The prophet: see <a href='/NABRE/40/16/14'>MAT 16:14</a> (""one of the prophets"") and <a href='/NABRE/40/21/46'>21:46</a>."
NABRE,40,21,11,"[10] 21:12-17 Matthew changes the order of (<a href='/NABRE/41/11/11'>MAK 11:11, 12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/11/15'>15</a>) and places the cleansing of the temple on the same day as the entry into Jerusalem, immediately after it. The activities going on in the temple areawere not secular but connected with the temple worship. Thus Jesus attack on those so engaged and his charge that they were makingGods house of prayer a den of thieves(<a href='/NABRE/40/21/12'>MAT 21:12-13</a>) constituted a claim to authority over the religious practices of Israel and were a challenge to the priestly authorities. <a href='/NABRE/40/21/14'>MAT 21:14-17</a> are peculiar to Matthew. Jesus healings and his countenancing the childrens cries of praise rouse the indignation of the chief priests and the scribes(<a href='/NABRE/40/21/15'>MAT 21:15</a>). These two groups appear in the infancy narrative (<a href='/NABRE/40/2/4'>MAT 2:4</a>) and have been mentioned in the first and third passion predictions (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/20/18'>20:18</a>). Now, as the passion approaches, they come on the scene again, exhibiting their hostility to Jesus."
NABRE,40,21,12,"[11] These activities were carried on in the court of the Gentiles, the outermost court of the temple area. Animals for sacrifice were sold; the doveswere for those who could not afford a more expensive offering; see <a href='/NABRE/3/5/7'>LEV 5:7</a>. Tables of the money changers: only the coinage of Tyre could be used for the purchases; other money had to be exchanged for that."
NABRE,40,21,13,"[12] My house…prayer: cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/56/7'>ISA 56:7</a>. Matthew omits the final words of the quotation, ""for all peoples"" (""all nations""), possibly because for him the worship of the God of Israel by all nations belongs to the time after the resurrection; see <a href='/NABRE/40/28/19'>MAT 28:19</a>. A den of thieves: the phrase is taken from <a href='/NABRE/24/7/11'>JER 7:11</a>."
NABRE,40,21,14,"[13] The blind and the lame: according to <a href='/NABRE/10/5/8'>2SM 5:8</a> LXX the blind and the lamewere forbidden to enter ""the house of the Lord,"" the temple. These are the last of Jesus healings in Matthew."
NABRE,40,21,15,[14] The wondrous things: the healings.
NABRE,40,21,16,[15] Out of the mouths…praise: cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/8/3'>PS 8:3</a> LXX.
NABRE,40,21,17,"[16] 21:18-22 In Mark the effect of Jesus cursing the fig tree is not immediate; see <a href='/NABRE/41/11/14'>MAK 11:14, 20</a>. By making it so, Matthew has heightened the miracle. Jesus act seems arbitrary and ill-tempered, but it is a prophetic action similar to those of Old Testament prophets that vividly symbolize some part of their preaching; see, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/26/12/1'>EZE 12:1-20</a>. It is a sign of the judgment that is to come upon the Israel that with all its apparent piety lacks the fruit of good deeds (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/10'>MAT 3:10</a>) and will soon bear the punishment of its fruitlessness (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/43'>MAT 21:43</a>). Some scholars propose that this story is the development in tradition of a parable of Jesus about the destiny of a fruitless tree, such as <a href='/NABRE/42/13/6'>LUK 13:6-9</a>. Jesus answer to the question of the amazed disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/20'>MAT 21:20</a>) makes the miracle an example of the power of prayer made with unwavering faith(<a href='/NABRE/40/21/21'>MAT 21:21-22</a>)."
NABRE,40,21,21,[17] See <a href='/NABRE/40/17/20'>MAT 17:20</a>.
NABRE,40,21,22,"[18] 21:23-27 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/11/27'>MAK 11:27-33</a>. This is the first of five controversies between Jesus and the religious authorities of Judaism in <a href='/NABRE/40/21/23'>MAT 21:23</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/22/46'>22:46</a>, presented in the form of questions and answers."
NABRE,40,21,23,"[19] These things: probably his entry into the city, his cleansing of the temple, and his healings there."
NABRE,40,21,24,[20] To reply by counterquestion was common in rabbinical debate.
NABRE,40,21,26,[21] We fear…as a prophet: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/14/5'>MAT 14:5</a>.
NABRE,40,21,27,"[22] Since through embarrassment on the one hand and fear on the other the religious authorities claim ignorance of the origin of Johns baptism, they show themselves incapable of speaking with authority; hence Jesus refuses to discuss with them the grounds of his authority."
NABRE,40,21,27,"[23] 21:28-32 The series of controversies is interrupted by three parables on the judgment of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/28'>MAT 21:28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/22/14'>22:14</a>) of which this, peculiar to Matthew, is the first. The second (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/33'>MAT 21:33-46</a>) comes from Mark (<a href='/NABRE/40/12/1'>12:1-12</a>), and the third (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/1'>MAT 22:1-14</a>) from Q; see <a href='/NABRE/42/14/15'>LUK 14:15-24</a>. This interruption of the controversies is similar to that in Mark, although Mark has only one parable between the first and second controversy. As regards Matthews first parable, <a href='/NABRE/40/21/28'>MAT 21:28-30</a> if taken by themselves could point simply to the difference between saying and doing, a theme of much importance in this gospel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/7/21'>MAT 7:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/12/50'>12:50</a>); that may have been the parables original reference. However, it is given a more specific application by the addition of <a href='/NABRE/40/21/31'>MAT 21:31-32</a>. The two sons represent, respectively, the religious leaders and the religious outcasts who followed Johns call to repentance. By the answer they give to Jesus question (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/31'>MAT 21:31</a>) the leaders condemn themselves. There is much confusion in the textual tradition of the parable. Of the three different forms of the text given by important textual witnesses, one has the leaders answer that the son who agreed to go but did not was the one who did the fathers will. Although some scholars accept that as the original reading, their arguments in favor of it seem unconvincing. The choice probably lies only between a reading that puts the son who agrees and then disobeys before the son who at first refuses and then obeys, and the reading followed in the present translation. The witnesses to the latter reading are slightly better than those that support the other."
NABRE,40,21,31,"[24] Entering…before you: this probably means ""they enter; you do not."""
NABRE,40,21,32,"[25] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/7/29'>LUK 7:29-30</a>. Although the thought is similar to that of the Lucan text, the formulation is so different that it is improbable that the saying comes from Q. Came to you…way of righteousness: several meanings are possible: that John himself was righteous, that he taught righteousness to others, or that he had an important place in Gods plan of salvation. For the last, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/14'>MAT 3:14-15</a>."
NABRE,40,21,32,"[26] 21:33-46 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/12/1'>MAK 12:1-12</a>. In this parable there is a close correspondence between most of the details of the story and the situation that it illustrates, the dealings of God with his people. Because of that heavy allegorizing, some scholars think that it does not in any way go back to Jesus, but represents the theology of the later church. That judgment applies to the Marcan parallel as well, although the allegorizing has gone farther in Matthew. There are others who believe that while many of the allegorical elements are due to church sources, they have been added to a basic parable spoken by Jesus. This view is now supported by the Gospel of Thomas 65, where a less allegorized and probably more primitive form of the parable is found."
NABRE,40,21,33,"[27] Planted a vineyard…a tower: cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/5/1'>ISA 5:1-2</a>. The vineyardis defined in <a href='/NABRE/23/5/7'>ISA 5:7</a> as ""the house of Israel."""
NABRE,40,21,34,"[28] 21:34-35 His servants: Matthew has two sendings of servantsas against Marks three sendings of a single servant (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/2'>MAK 12:2-5</a>a) followed by a statement about the sending of ""many others"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/2'>MAK 12:2, 5</a>b). That these servants stand for the prophets sent by God to Israel is clearly implied but not made explicit here, but see <a href='/NABRE/40/23/37'>MAT 23:37</a>. His produce: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/12/2'>MAK 12:2</a> ""some of the produce."" The produceis the good works demanded by God, and his claim to them is total."
NABRE,40,21,38,"[29] Acquire his inheritance: if a Jewish proselyte died without heir, the tenants of his land would have final claim on it."
NABRE,40,21,39,[30] Threw him out…and killed him: the change in the Marcan order where the son is killed and his corpse then thrown out (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/8'>MAK 12:8</a>) was probably made because of the tradition that Jesus died outside the city of Jerusalem; see <a href='/NABRE/43/19/17'>JHN 19:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/13/12'>HEB 13:12</a>.
NABRE,40,21,41,[31] They answered: in <a href='/NABRE/41/12/9'>MAK 12:9</a> the question is answered by Jesus himself; here the leaders answer and so condemn themselves; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/21/31'>MAT 21:31</a>. Matthew adds that the new tenantsto whom the vineyard will be transferred will givethe owner the produce at the proper times.
NABRE,40,21,42,"[32] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/118/22'>PS 118:22-23</a>. The psalm was used in the early church as a prophecy of Jesus resurrection; see <a href='/NABRE/44/4/11'>ACT 4:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/2/7'>1PE 2:7</a>. If, as some think, the original parable ended at <a href='/NABRE/40/21/39'>MAT 21:39</a> it was thought necessary to complete it by a reference to Jesus vindication by God."
NABRE,40,21,43,"[1] Peculiar to Matthew. Kingdom of God: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/19/23'>MAT 19:23-24</a>. Its presence here instead of Matthews usual ""kingdom of heaven"" may indicate that the saying came from Matthews own traditional material. A people that will produce its fruit: believing Israelites and Gentiles, the church of Jesus."
NABRE,40,21,44,[2] The majority of textual witnesses omit this verse. It is probably an early addition to Matthew from <a href='/NABRE/42/20/18'>LUK 20:18</a> with which it is practically identical.
NABRE,40,21,45,[3] The Pharisees: Matthew inserts into the group of Jewish leaders (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/23'>MAT 21:23</a>) those who represented the Judaism of his own time.
NABRE,40,22,1,"[1] 22:1-14 This parable is from Q; see <a href='/NABRE/42/14/15'>LUK 14:15-24</a>. It has been given many allegorical traits by Matthew, e.g., the burning of the cityof the guests who refused the invitation (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/7'>MAT 22:7</a>), which corresponds to the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans in A.D. 70. It has similarities with the preceding parable of the tenants: the sending of two groups of servants(<a href='/NABRE/40/22/3'>MAT 22:3, 4</a>), the murder of the servants(<a href='/NABRE/40/22/6'>MAT 22:6</a>), the punishment of the murderers(<a href='/NABRE/40/22/7'>MAT 22:7</a>), and the entrance of a new group into a privileged situation of which the others had proved themselves unworthy (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/8'>MAT 22:8-10</a>). The parable ends with a section that is peculiar to Matthew (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/11'>MAT 22:11-14</a>), which some take as a distinct parable. Matthew presents the kingdomin its double aspect, already present and something that can be entered here and now (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/1'>MAT 22:1-10</a>), and something that will be possessed only by those present members who can stand the scrutiny of the final judgment (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/11'>MAT 22:11-14</a>). The parable is not only a statement of Gods judgment on Israel but a warning to Matthews church."
NABRE,40,22,2,[2] Wedding feast: the Old Testaments portrayal of final salvation under the image of a banquet (<a href='/NABRE/23/25/6'>ISA 25:6</a>) is taken up also in <a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/13/15'>LUK 13:15</a>.
NABRE,40,22,3,[3] 22:3-4 Servants…other servants: probably Christian missionaries in both instances; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/23/34'>MAT 23:34</a>.

NABRE,40,22,10,[5] Bad and good alike: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/13/47'>MAT 13:47</a>.
NABRE,40,22,11,"[6] A wedding garment: the repentance, change of heart and mind, that is the condition for entrance into the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/4/17'>4:17</a>) must be continued in a life of good deeds (<a href='/NABRE/40/7/21'>MAT 7:21-23</a>)."
NABRE,40,22,13,[7] Wailing and grinding of teeth: the Christian who lacks the wedding garment of good deeds will suffer the same fate as those Jews who have rejected Jesus; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11-12</a>.
NABRE,40,22,14,"[8] 22:15-22 The series of controversies between Jesus and the representatives of Judaism (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/21/23'>MAT 21:23-27</a>) is resumed. As in the first (<a href='/NABRE/40/21/23'>MAT 21:23-27</a>), here and in the following disputes Matthew follows his Marcan source with few modifications."
NABRE,40,22,15,"[9] The Pharisees: while Matthew retains the Marcan union of Pharisees and Herodians in this account, he clearly emphasizes the Pharisees part. They alone are mentioned here, and the Herodians are joined with them only in a prepositional phrase of <a href='/NABRE/40/22/16'>MAT 22:16</a>. Entrap him in speech: the question that they will pose is intended to force Jesus to take either a position contrary to that held by the majority of the people or one that will bring him into conflict with the Roman authorities."
NABRE,40,22,16,[10] Herodians: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/3/6'>MAK 3:6</a>. They would favor payment of the tax; the Pharisees did not.
NABRE,40,22,17,[11] Is it lawful: the law to which they refer is the law of God.
NABRE,40,22,19,[12] They handed him the Roman coin: their readiness in producing the money implies their use of it and their acceptance of the financial advantages of the Roman administration in Palestine.
NABRE,40,22,21,"[13] Caesars: the emperor Tiberius (A.D. 14-37). Repay to Caesar what belongs to Caesar: those who willingly use the coin that is Caesars should repayhim in kind. The answer avoids taking sides in the question of the lawfulness of the tax. To God what belongs to God: Jesus raises the debate to a new level. Those who have hypocritically asked about tax in respect to its relation to the law of Godshould be concerned rather with repaying God with the good deeds that are his due; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/21/41'>MAT 21:41, 43</a>."
NABRE,40,22,22,"[14] 22:23-33 Here Jesus opponents are the Sadducees, members of the powerful priestly party of his time; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/7'>MAT 3:7</a>. Denying the resurrection of the dead, a teaching of relatively late origin in Judaism (cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/12/2'>DAN 12:2</a>), they appeal to a law of the Pentateuch (<a href='/NABRE/5/25/5'>DEU 25:5-10</a>) and present a case based on it that would make resurrection from the dead ridiculous (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/24'>MAT 22:24-28</a>). Jesus chides them for knowing neither the scripturesnor the power of God(<a href='/NABRE/40/22/29'>MAT 22:29</a>). His argument in respect to Gods power contradicts the notion, held even by many proponents as well as by opponents of the teaching, that the life of those raised from the dead would be essentially a continuation of the type of life they had had before death (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/30'>MAT 22:30</a>). His argument based on the scriptures (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/31'>MAT 22:31-32</a>) is of a sort that was accepted as valid among Jews of the time."
NABRE,40,22,23,"[15] Saying that there is no resurrection: in the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/22/12'>MAK 22:12, 18</a>) the Sadducees are correctly defined as those ""who say there is no resurrection""; see also <a href='/NABRE/42/20/27'>LUK 20:27</a>. Matthews rewording of Mark can mean that these particular Sadducees deny the resurrection, which would imply that he was not aware that the denial was characteristic of the party. For some scholars this is an indication of his being a Gentile Christian; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/21/4'>MAT 21:4-5</a>."
NABRE,40,22,24,"[16] If a man dies…his brother: this is known as the ""law of the levirate,"" from the Latin levir, ""brother-in-law."" Its purpose was to continue the family line of the deceased brother (<a href='/NABRE/5/25/6'>DEU 25:6</a>)."
NABRE,40,22,29,[17] The sexual relationships of this world will be transcended; the risen body will be the work of the creative power of God.
NABRE,40,22,31,"[18] 22:31-32 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/3/6'>EXO 3:6</a>. In the Pentateuch, which the Sadducees accepted as normative for Jewish belief and practice, God speaks even now (to you) of himself as the God of the patriarchs who died centuries ago. He identifies himself in relation to them, and because of their relation to him, the living God, they too are alive. This might appear no argument for the resurrection, but simply for life after death as conceived in <a href='/NABRE/70/3/1'>WIS 3:1-3</a>. But the general thought of early first-century Judaism was not influenced by that conception; for it human immortality was connected with the existence of the body."
NABRE,40,22,33,"[19] 22:34-40 The Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/28'>MAK 12:28-34</a>) is an exchange between Jesus and a scribe who is impressed by the way in which Jesus has conducted himself in the previous controversy (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/28'>MAK 12:28</a>), who compliments him for the answer he gives him (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/32'>MAK 12:32</a>), and who is said by Jesus to be ""not far from the kingdom of God"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/34'>MAK 12:34</a>). Matthew has sharpened that scene. The questioner, as the representative of other Pharisees, tests Jesus by his question (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/34'>MAT 22:34-35</a>), and both his reaction to Jesus reply and Jesus commendation of him are lacking."
NABRE,40,22,35,"[20] [A scholar of the law]: meaning ""scribe."" Although this reading is supported by the vast majority of textual witnesses, it is the only time that the Greek word so translated occurs in Matthew. It is relatively frequent in Luke, and there is reason to think that it may have been added here by a copyist since it occurs in the Lucan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/42/10/25'>LUK 10:25-28</a>). Tested: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/19/3'>MAT 19:3</a>."
NABRE,40,22,36,"[21] For the devout Jew all the commandments were to be kept with equal care, but there is evidence of preoccupation in Jewish sources with the question put to Jesus."
NABRE,40,22,37,"[22] 22:37-38 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/6/5'>DEU 6:5</a>. Matthew omits the first part of Marks fuller quotation (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/29'>MAK 12:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/6/4'>DEU 6:4-5</a>), probably because he considered its monotheistic emphasis needless for his church. The love of God must engage the total person (heart, soul, mind)."
NABRE,40,22,39,"[23] Jesus goes beyond the extent of the question put to him and joins to the greatest and the first commandmenta second, that of loveof neighbor, <a href='/NABRE/3/19/18'>LEV 19:18</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/19/18'>MAT 19:18-19</a>. This combination of the two commandments may already have been made in Judaism."
NABRE,40,22,40,[24] The double commandment is the source from which the whole law and the prophetsare derived.
NABRE,40,22,40,"[25] 22:41-46 Having answered the questions of his opponents in the preceding three controversies, Jesus now puts a question to them about the sonship of the Messiah. Their easy response (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/43'>MAT 22:43</a>a) is countered by his quoting a verse of <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110</a> that raises a problem for their response (43b-45). They are unable to solve it and from that day ontheir questioning of him is ended."
NABRE,40,22,41,[26] The Pharisees…questioned them: Mark is not specific about who are questioned (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/35'>MAK 12:35</a>).
NABRE,40,22,42,"[27] 22:42-44 Davids: this view of the Pharisees was based on such Old Testament texts as <a href='/NABRE/23/11/1'>ISA 11:1-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/23/5'>JER 23:5</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/26/34/23'>EZE 34:23</a>; see also the extrabiblical Psalms of Solomon <a href='/NABRE/40/17/21'>17:21</a>. How, then…saying: Jesus cites <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a> accepting the Davidic authorship of the psalm, a common view of his time. The psalm was probably composed for the enthronement of a Davidic king of Judah. Matthew assumes that the Pharisees interpret it as referring to the Messiah, although there is no clear evidence that it was so interpreted in the Judaism of Jesus time. It was widely used in the early church as referring to the exaltation of the risen Jesus. My lord: understood as the Messiah."
NABRE,40,22,45,"[28] Since Matthew presents Jesus both as Messiah (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/16'>MAT 16:16</a>) and as Son of David (<a href='/NABRE/40/1/1'>MAT 1:1</a>; see also note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/27'>MAT 9:27</a>), the question is not meant to imply Jesus denial of Davidic sonship. It probably means that although he is the Son of David, he is someone greater, Son of Man and Son of God, and recognized as greater by David who calls him my lord."
NABRE,40,23,2,"[1] 23:2-3 Have taken their seat…Moses: it is uncertain whether this is simply a metaphor for Mosaic teaching authority or refers to an actual chairon which the teacher sat. It has been proved that there was a seat so designated in synagogues of a later period than that of this gospel. Do and observe…they tell you: since the Matthean Jesus abrogates Mosaic law (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/31'>MAT 5:31-42</a>), warns his disciples against the teaching of the Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/40/14/1'>MAT 14:1-12</a>), and, in this speech, denounces the Pharisees as blind guides in respect to their teaching on oaths (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/16'>MAT 23:16-22</a>), this commandment to observe all things whatsoever they(the scribes and Pharisees) tell youcannot be taken as the evangelists understanding of the proper standard of conduct for his church. The saying may reflect a period when the Matthean community was largely Jewish Christian and was still seeking to avoid a complete break with the synagogue. Matthew has incorporated this traditional material into the speech in accordance with his view of the course of salvation history, in which he portrays the time of Jesus ministry as marked by the fidelity to the law, although with significant pointers to the new situation that would exist after his death and resurrection (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/5/17'>MAT 5:17-20</a>). The crowds and the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/1'>MAT 23:1</a>) are exhorted not to followthe exampleof the Jewish leaders, whose deeds do not conform to their teaching (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/3'>MAT 23:3</a>)."
NABRE,40,23,4,[2] Tie up heavy burdens: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/11/28'>MAT 11:28</a>.
NABRE,40,23,5,"[3] To the charge of preaching but not practicing (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/3'>MAT 23:3</a>), Jesus adds that of acting in order to earn praise. The disciples have already been warned against this same fault (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/6/1'>MAT 6:1-18</a>). Phylacteries: the Mosaic law required that during prayer small boxes containing parchments on which verses of scripture were written be worn on the left forearm and the forehead (see <a href='/NABRE/2/13/9'>EXO 13:9, 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/6/8'>DEU 6:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/11/18'>11:18</a>). Tassels: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/20'>MAT 9:20</a>. The widening of phylacteriesand the lengthening of tasselswere for the purpose of making these evidences of piety more noticeable."
NABRE,40,23,6,"[4] 23:6-7 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/12/38'>MAK 12:38-39</a>. Rabbi: literally, ""my great one,"" a title of respect for teachers and leaders."
NABRE,40,23,8,"[5] 23:8-12 These verses, warning against the use of various titles, are addressed to the disciples alone. While only the title Rabbihas been said to be used in addressing the scribes and Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/7'>MAT 23:7</a>), the implication is that Fatherand Masteralso were. The prohibition of these titles to the disciples suggests that their use was present in Matthews church. The Matthean Jesus forbids not only the titles but the spirit of superiority and pride that is shown by their acceptance. Whoever exalts…will be exalted: cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/14/11'>LUK 14:11</a>."
NABRE,40,23,13,"[6] 23:13-36 This series of seven ""woes,"" directed against the scribes and Phariseesand addressed to them, is the heart of the speech. The phrase woe tooccurs often in the prophetic and apocalyptic literature, expressing horror of a sin and punishment for those who commit it. Hypocrites: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/6/2'>MAT 6:2</a>. The hypocrisy of the scribes and Phariseesconsists in the difference between their speech and action (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/3'>MAT 23:3</a>) and in demonstrations of piety that have no other purpose than to enhance their reputation as religious persons (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/5'>MAT 23:5</a>)."
NABRE,40,23,13,"[7] You lock the kingdom of heaven: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a> where Jesus tells Peter that he will give him the keys to the kingdom of heaven. The purpose of the authority expressed by that metaphor is to give entrance into the kingdom (the kingdom is closed only to those who reject the authority); here the charge is made that the authority of the scribes and Phariseesis exercised in such a way as to be an obstacle to entrance. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/11/52'>LUK 11:52</a> where the accusation against the ""scholars of the law"" (Matthews scribes) is that they ""have taken away the key of knowledge."""
NABRE,40,23,14,"[8] Some manuscripts add a verse here or after <a href='/NABRE/40/23/12'>MAT 23:12</a>, ""Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites. You devour the houses of widows and, as a pretext, recite lengthy prayers. Because of this, you will receive a very severe condemnation."" Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/12/40'>MAK 12:40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/20/47'>LUK 20:47</a>. This ""woe"" is almost identical with <a href='/NABRE/41/12/40'>MAK 12:40</a> and seems to be an interpolation derived from that text."
NABRE,40,23,15,"[9] In the first century A.D. until the First Jewish Revolt against Rome (A.D. 66-70), many Pharisees conducted a vigorous missionary campaign among Gentiles. Convert: literally, ""proselyte,"" a Gentile who accepted Judaism fully by submitting to circumcision and all other requirements of Mosaic law. Child of Gehenna: worthy of everlasting punishment; for Gehenna, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/5/22'>MAT 5:22</a>. Twice as much as yourselves: possibly this refers simply to the zeal of the convert, surpassing that of the one who converted him."
NABRE,40,23,16,"[10] 23:16-22 An attack on the casuistry that declared some oaths binding (one is obligated) and others not (it means nothing) and held the binding oath to be the one made by something of lesser value (the gold; the gift on the altar). Such teaching, which inverts the order of values, reveals the teachers to be blind guides; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/15/14'>MAT 15:14</a>. Since the Matthean Jesus forbids all oaths to his disciples (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/33'>MAT 5:33-37</a>), this woe does not set up a standard for Christian moral conduct, but ridicules the Pharisees on their own terms."
NABRE,40,23,23,"[11] The Mosaic law ordered tithing of the produce of the land (<a href='/NABRE/3/27/30'>LEV 27:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/14/22'>DEU 14:22-23</a>), and the scribal tradition is said here to have extended this law to even the smallest herbs. The practice is criticized not in itself but because it shows the Pharisees preoccupation with matters of less importance while they neglect the weightier things of the law."
NABRE,40,23,24,"[12] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/11/41'>LEV 11:41-45</a> that forbids the eating of any ""swarming creature."" The Pharisees scrupulosity about minor matters and neglect of greater ones (<a href='/NABRE/40/23/23'>MAT 23:23</a>) is further brought out by this contrast between straining liquids that might contain a tiny ""swarming creature"" and yet swallowing the camel. The latter was one of the unclean animals forbidden by the law (<a href='/NABRE/3/11/4'>LEV 11:4</a>), but it is hardly possible that the scribes and Pharisees are being denounced as guilty of so gross a violation of the food laws. To swallow the camelis only a hyperbolic way of speaking of their neglect of what is important."
NABRE,40,23,25,"[13] 23:25-26 The ritual washing of utensils for dining (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/7/4'>MAK 7:4</a>) is turned into a metaphor illustrating a concern for appearances while inner purity is ignored. The scribes and Phariseesare compared to cups carefully washed on the outside but filthy within. Self-indulgence: the Greek word here translated means lack of self-control, whether in drinking or in sexual conduct."
NABRE,40,23,27,"[14] 23:27-28 The sixth woe, like the preceding one, deals with concern for externals and neglect of what is inside. Since contact with dead bodies, even when one was unaware of it, caused ritual impurity (<a href='/NABRE/4/19/11'>NUM 19:11-22</a>), tombs were whitewashed so that no one would contract such impurity inadvertently."
NABRE,40,23,29,[15] 23:29-36 The final woeis the most serious indictment of all. It portrays the scribes and Phariseesas standing in the same line as their ancestorswho murdered the prophetsand the righteous.
NABRE,40,23,29,"[16] 23:29-32 In spite of honoring the slain dead by building their tombsand adorning their memorials, and claiming that they would not have joined in their ancestors crimes if they had lived intheir days, the scribes and Phariseesare true children of their ancestors and are defiantly ordered by Jesus to fill upwhat those ancestors measured out. This order reflects the Jewish notion that there was an allotted measure of suffering that had to be completed before Gods final judgment would take place."
NABRE,40,23,34,"[17] 23:34-36 There are important differences between the Matthean and the Lucan form of this Q material; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/11/49'>LUK 11:49-51</a>. In Luke the one who sends the emissaries is the ""wisdom of God."" If, as many scholars think, that is the original wording of Q, Matthew, by making Jesus the sender, has presented him as the personified divine wisdom. In Luke, wisdoms emissaries are the Old Testament ""prophets"" and the Christian ""apostles."" Matthews prophets and wise men and scribesare probably Christian disciples alone; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/10/41'>MAT 10:41</a> and see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/52'>MAT 13:52</a>. You will kill: see <a href='/NABRE/40/24/9'>MAT 24:9</a>. Scourge in your synagogues…town to town: see <a href='/NABRE/40/10/17'>MAT 10:17, 23</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/40/10/17'>MAT 10:17</a>. All the righteous blood shed upon the earth: the slaying of the disciples is in continuity with all the shedding of righteous bloodbeginning with that of Abel. The persecution of Jesus disciples by this generationinvolves the persecutors in the guilt of their murderous ancestors. The blood of Zechariah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/11/51'>LUK 11:51</a>. By identifying him as the son of BarachiahMatthew understands him to be Zechariah the Old Testament minor prophet; see <a href='/NABRE/38/1/1'>ZEC 1:1</a>."
NABRE,40,23,36,"[18] 23:37-39 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/13/34'>LUK 13:34-35</a>. The denunciation of Pharisaic Judaism ends with this lament over Jerusalem, which has repeatedly rejected and murdered those whom God has sentto her. How many times: this may refer to various visits of Jesus to the city, an aspect of his ministry found in John but otherwise not in the synoptics. As a hen…under her wings: for imagery similar to this, see <a href='/NABRE/19/17/8'>PS 17:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/91/4'>91:4</a>. Your house…desolate: probably an allusion to the destruction of the temple in A.D. 70. You will not see me…in the name of the Lord: Israel will not see Jesus again until he comes in glory for the final judgment. The acclamation has been interpreted in contrasting ways, as an indication that Israel will at last accept Jesus at that time, and as its troubled recognition of him as its dreaded judge who will pronounce its condemnation; in support of the latter view see <a href='/NABRE/40/24/30'>MAT 24:30</a>."
NABRE,40,24,1,"[1] 24:1-25:46 The discourse of the fifth book, the last of the five around which the gospel is structured. It is called the ""eschatological"" discourse since it deals with the coming of the new age (the eschaton) in its fullness, with events that will precede it, and with how the disciples are to conduct themselves while awaiting an event that is as certain as its exact time is unknown to all but the Father (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/36'>MAT 24:36</a>). The discourse may be divided into two parts, <a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>MAT 24:1-44</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/24/45'>MAT 24:45</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/25/46'>25:46</a>. In the first, Matthew follows his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/1'>MAK 13:1-37</a>) closely. The second is drawn from Q and from the evangelists own traditional material. Both parts show Matthews editing of his sources by deletions, additions, and modifications. The vigilant waiting that is emphasized in the second part does not mean a cessation of ordinary activity and concentration only on what is to come, but a faithful accomplishment of duties at hand, with awareness that the end, for which the disciples must always be ready, will entail the great judgment by which the everlasting destiny of all will be determined."
NABRE,40,24,2,"[2] As in Mark, Jesus predicts the destruction of the temple. By omitting the Marcan story of the widows contribution (<a href='/NABRE/41/12/41'>MAK 12:41-44</a>) that immediately precedes the prediction in that gospel, Matthew has established a close connection between it and <a href='/NABRE/40/23/38'>MAT 23:38</a>, ""…your house will be abandoned desolate."""
NABRE,40,24,3,"[3] The Mount of Olives: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/21/1'>MAT 21:1</a>. The disciples: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/13/3'>MAK 13:3-4</a> where only Peter, James, John, and Andrew put the question that is answered by the discourse. In both gospels, however, the question is put privately: the ensuing discourse is only for those who are disciplesof Jesus. When will this happen…end of the age?: Matthew distinguishes carefully between the destruction of the temple (this) and the comingof Jesus that will bring the end of the age. In Mark the two events are more closely connected, a fact that may be explained by Marks believing that the one would immediately succeed the other. Coming: this translates the Greek word parousia, which is used in the gospels only here and in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/27'>MAT 24:27, 37</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/24/39'>39</a>. It designated the official visit of a ruler to a city or the manifestation of a saving deity, and it was used by Christians to refer to the final coming of Jesus in glory, a term first found in the New Testament with that meaning in <a href='/NABRE/52/2/19'>1TS 2:19</a>. The end of the age: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/39'>MAT 13:39</a>."
NABRE,40,24,4,"[4] 24:4-14 This section of the discourse deals with calamities in the world (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/6'>MAT 24:6-7</a>) and in the church (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/9'>MAT 24:9-12</a>). The former must happenbefore the endcomes (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/6'>MAT 24:6</a>), but they are only the beginning of the labor pains(<a href='/NABRE/40/24/8'>MAT 24:8</a>). (It may be noted that the Greek word translated the endin <a href='/NABRE/40/24/6'>MAT 24:6</a> and in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/13'>MAT 24:13-14</a> is not the same as the phrase ""the end of the age"" in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/3'>MAT 24:3</a>, although the meaning is the same.) The latter are sufferings of the church, both from within and without, that will last until the gospelis preached…to all nations. Then the end will comeand those who have endured the sufferings with fidelity will be saved(<a href='/NABRE/40/24/13'>MAT 24:13-14</a>)."
NABRE,40,24,6,"[5] 24:6-7 The disturbances mentioned here are a commonplace of apocalyptic language, as is the assurance that they must happen(see <a href='/NABRE/27/2/28'>DAN 2:28</a> LXX), for that is the plan of God. Kingdom against kingdom: see <a href='/NABRE/23/19/2'>ISA 19:2</a>."
NABRE,40,24,8,"[6] The labor pains: the tribulations leading up to the end of the age are compared to the pains of a woman about to give birth. There is much attestation for rabbinic use of the phrase ""the woes (or birth pains) of the Messiah"" after the New Testament period, but in at least one instance it is attributed to a rabbi who lived in the late first century A.D. In this Jewish usage it meant the distress of the time preceding the coming of the Messiah; here, the labor painsprecede the coming of the Son of Man in glory."
NABRE,40,24,9,"[7] 24:9-12 Matthew has used <a href='/NABRE/41/13/9'>MAK 13:9-12</a> in his missionary discourse (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/17'>MAT 10:17-21</a>) and omits it here. Besides the sufferings, including death, and the hatred of all nationsthat the disciples will have to endure, there will be worse affliction within the church itself. This is described in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/10'>MAT 24:10-12</a>, which are peculiar to Matthew. Will be led into sin: literally, ""will be scandalized,"" probably meaning that they will become apostates; see <a href='/NABRE/40/13/21'>MAT 13:21</a> where ""fall away"" translates the same Greek word as here. Betray: in the Greek this is the same word as the hand overof <a href='/NABRE/40/24/9'>MAT 24:9</a>. The handing over to persecution and hatred from outside will have their counterpart within the church. False prophets: these are Christians; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/7/15'>MAT 7:15-20</a>. Evildoing: see <a href='/NABRE/40/7/23'>MAT 7:23</a>. Because of the apocalyptic nature of much of this discourse, the literal meaning of this description of the church should not be pressed too hard. However, there is reason to think that Matthews addition of these verses reflects in some measure the condition of his community."
NABRE,40,24,14,"[8] Except for the last part (and then the end will come), this verse substantially repeats <a href='/NABRE/41/13/10'>MAK 13:10</a>. The Matthean addition raises a problem since what follows in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/15'>MAT 24:15-23</a> refers to the horrors of the First Jewish Revolt including the destruction of the temple, and Matthew, writing after that time, knew that the parousia of Jesus was still in the future. A solution may be that the evangelist saw the events of those verses as foreshadowing the cosmic disturbances that he associates with the parousia (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/29'>MAT 24:29</a>) so that the period in which the former took place could be understood as belonging to the end."
NABRE,40,24,14,"[9] 24:15-28 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/17/23'>LUK 17:23-24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/17/37'>37</a>. A further stage in the tribulations that will precede the coming of the Son of Man, and an answer to the question of <a href='/NABRE/40/24/3'>MAT 24:3</a>a, ""when will this (the destruction of the temple) happen?"""
NABRE,40,24,15,"[10] The desolating abomination: in 167 B.C. the Syrian king Antiochus IV Epiphanes desecrated the temple by setting up in it a statue of Zeus Olympios (see <a href='/NABRE/74/1/54'>1MA 1:54</a>). That event is referred to in <a href='/NABRE/27/12/11'>DAN 12:11</a> LXX as the ""desolating abomination"" (NAB ""horrible abomination"") and the same Greek term is used here; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/27/9/27'>DAN 9:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/11/31'>11:31</a>. Although the desecration had taken place before Daniel was written, it is presented there as a future event, and Matthew sees that ""prophecy"" fulfilled in the desecration of the temple by the Romans. In the holy place: the temple; more precise than Marks where he should not(<a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14</a>). Let the reader understand: this parenthetical remark, taken from <a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14</a> invites the readerto realize the meaning of Daniels ""prophecy."""
NABRE,40,24,16,"[11] The tradition that the Christians of Jerusalem fled from that city to Pella, a city of Transjordan, at the time of the First Jewish Revolt is found in Eusebius (Ecclesiastical History, 3.5.3), who attributes the flight to ""a certain oracle given by revelation before the war."" The tradition is not improbable but the Matthean command, derived from its Marcan source, is vague in respect to the place of flight (to the mountains), although some scholars see it as applicable to the flight to Pella."
NABRE,40,24,17,"[12] 24:17-19 Haste is essential, and the journey will be particularly difficult for women who are burdened with unborn or infant children."
NABRE,40,24,20,[13] On the sabbath: this addition to in winter(cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/13/18'>MAK 13:18</a>) has been understood as an indication that Matthew was addressed to a church still observing the Mosaic law of sabbath rest and the scribal limitations upon the length of journeys that might lawfully be made on that day. That interpretation conflicts with Matthews view on sabbath observance (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/12/1'>MAT 12:1-14</a>). The meaning of the addition may be that those undertaking on the sabbath a journey such as the one here ordered would be offending the sensibilities of law-observant Jews and would incur their hostility.
NABRE,40,24,21,"[14] For the unparalleled distress of that time, see <a href='/NABRE/27/12/1'>DAN 12:1</a>."
NABRE,40,24,26,"[15] 24:26-28 Claims that the Messiah is to be found in some distant or secret place must be ignored. The coming of the Son of Manwill be as clear as lightningis to all and as the corpseof an animal is to vultures; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/17/24'>LUK 17:24, 37</a>. Here there is clear identification of the Son of Manand the Messiah; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/24/23'>MAT 24:23</a>."
NABRE,40,24,29,"[16] The answer to the question of <a href='/NABRE/40/24/3'>MAT 24:3</a>b, ""What sign will there be of your coming?"" Immediately after…those days: the shortening of time between the preceding tribulationand the parousia has been explained as Matthews use of a supposed device of Old Testament prophecy whereby certainty that a predicted event will occur is expressed by depicting it as imminent. While it is questionable that that is an acceptable understanding of the Old Testament predictions, it may be applicable here, for Matthew knew that the parousia had not come immediately afterthe fall of Jerusalem, and it is unlikely that he is attributing a mistaken calculation of time to Jesus. The sun…be shaken: cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/13/10'>ISA 13:10, 13</a>."
NABRE,40,24,30,"[17] The sign of the Son of Man: perhaps this means the signthat is the glorious appearance of the Son of Man; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/12/39'>MAT 12:39-40</a> where ""the sign of Jonah"" is Jonahs being in the ""belly of the whale."" Tribes of the earth will mourn: peculiar to Matthew; cf. <a href='/NABRE/38/12/12'>ZEC 12:12-14</a>. Coming upon the clouds…glory: cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/7/13'>DAN 7:13</a>, although there the ""one like a son of man"" comes to God to receive kingship; here the Son of Mancomes from heaven for judgment."

NABRE,40,24,34,"[20] The difficulty raised by this verse cannot be satisfactorily removed by the supposition that this generationmeans the Jewish people throughout the course of their history, much less the entire human race. Perhaps for Matthew it means the generationto which he and his community belonged."
NABRE,40,24,35,"[21] 24:36-44 The statement of <a href='/NABRE/40/24/34'>MAT 24:34</a> is now counterbalanced by one that declares that the exact time of the parousia is known only to the Father(<a href='/NABRE/40/24/36'>MAT 24:36</a>), and the disciples are warned to be always ready for it. This section is drawn from Mark and Q (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/17/26'>LUK 17:26-27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/17/34'>34-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/39'>12:39-40</a>)."
NABRE,40,24,36,"[22] Many textual witnesses omit nor the Son, which follows <a href='/NABRE/41/13/32'>MAK 13:32</a>. Since its omission can be explained by reluctance to attribute this ignorance to the Son, the reading that includes it is probably original."
NABRE,40,24,37,"[23] 24:37-39 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/17/26'>LUK 17:26-27</a>. In the days of Noah: the Old Testament account of the flood lays no emphasis upon what is central for Matthew, i.e., the unexpected coming of the flood upon those who were unprepared for it."
NABRE,40,24,40,"[24] 24:40-41 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/17/34'>LUK 17:34-35</a>. Taken…left: the former probably means takeninto the kingdom; the latter, leftfor destruction. People in the same situation will be dealt with in opposite ways. In this context, the discrimination between them will be based on their readiness for the coming of the Son of Man."
NABRE,40,24,42,[25] 24:42-44 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/12/39'>LUK 12:39-40</a>. The theme of vigilance and readiness is continued with the bold comparison of the Son of Man to a thief who comes to break into a house.
NABRE,40,24,44,[26] 24:45-51 The second part of the discourse (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>MAT 24:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/25/46'>25:46</a>) begins with this parable of the faithfulor unfaithful servant; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/12/41'>LUK 12:41-46</a>. It is addressed to the leaders of Matthews church; the servant hasbeen put in chargeof his masters household(<a href='/NABRE/40/24/45'>MAT 24:45</a>) even though that household is composed of those who are his fellow servants(<a href='/NABRE/40/24/49'>MAT 24:49</a>).
NABRE,40,24,45,[27] To distribute…proper time: readiness for the masters return means a vigilance that is accompanied by faithful performance of the duty assigned.
NABRE,40,24,48,"[28] My master…delayed: the note of delay is found also in the other parables of this section; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/25/5'>MAT 25:5, 19</a>."
NABRE,40,24,51,"[29] Punish him severely: the Greek verb, found in the New Testament only here and in the Lucan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/42/12/46'>LUK 12:46</a>), means, literally, ""cut in two."" With the hypocrites: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/6/2'>MAT 6:2</a>. Matthew classes the unfaithful Christian leader with the unbelieving leaders of Judaism. Wailing and grinding of teeth: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11-12</a>."

NABRE,40,25,2,"[3] 25:2-4 Foolish…wise: cf. the contrasted ""wise man"" and ""fool"" of <a href='/NABRE/40/7/24'>MAT 7:24, 26</a> where the two are distinguished by good deeds and lack of them, and such deeds may be signified by the oilof this parable."
NABRE,40,25,11,"[4] 25:11-12 Lord, Lord: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/7/21'>MAT 7:21</a>. I do not know you: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/7/23'>MAT 7:23</a> where the Greek verb is different but synonymous."
NABRE,40,25,13,"[5] Stay awake: some scholars see this command as an addition to the original parable of Matthews traditional material, since in <a href='/NABRE/40/25/5'>MAT 25:5</a> all the virgins, wise and foolish, fall asleep. But the wise virgins are adequately equipped for their task, and stay awake may mean no more than to be prepared; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/24/42'>MAT 24:42, 44</a>."

NABRE,40,25,14,"[7] It will be as when…journey: literally, ""For just as a man who was going on a journey."" Although the comparison is not completed, the sense is clear; the kingdom of heaven is like the situation here described. Faithful use of ones gifts will lead to participation in the fullness of the kingdom, lazy inactivity to exclusion from it."

NABRE,40,25,18,[9] Buried his masters money: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/44'>MAT 13:44</a>.
NABRE,40,25,20,"[10] 25:20-23 Although the first two servants have received and doubled large sums, their faithful trading is regarded by the master as fidelity in small mattersonly, compared with the great responsibilitiesnow to be given to them. The latter are unspecified. Share your masters joy: probably the joy of the banquet of the kingdom; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11</a>."
NABRE,40,25,26,"[11] 25:26-28 Wicked, lazy servant: this mans inactivity is not negligible but seriously culpable. As punishment, he loses the gift he had received, that is now given to the first servant, whose possessions are already great."
NABRE,40,25,29,[12] See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/12'>MAT 13:12</a> where there is a similar application of this maxim.
NABRE,40,25,30,[13] See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/11'>MAT 8:11-12</a>.
NABRE,40,25,30,"[14] 25:31-46 The conclusion of the discourse, which is peculiar to Matthew, portrays the final judgment that will accompany the parousia. Although often called a ""parable,"" it is not really such, for the only parabolic elements are the depiction of the Son of Manas a shepherdand of the righteousand the wicked as sheepand goats, respectively (<a href='/NABRE/40/25/32'>MAT 25:32-33</a>). The criterion of judgment will be the deeds of mercy that have been done for the leastof Jesus brothers(<a href='/NABRE/40/25/40'>MAT 25:40</a>). A difficult and important question is the identification of these least brothers. Are they all people who have suffered hunger, thirst, etc. (<a href='/NABRE/40/25/35'>MAT 25:35, 36</a>) or a particular group of such sufferers? Scholars are divided in their response and arguments can be made for either side. But leaving aside the problem of what the traditional material that Matthew edited may have meant, it seems that a stronger case can be made for the view that in the evangelists sense the sufferers are Christians, probably Christian missionaries whose sufferings were brought upon them by their preaching of the gospel. The criterion of judgment for all the nationsis their treatment of those who have borne to the world the message of Jesus, and this means ultimately their acceptance or rejection of Jesus himself; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/10/40'>MAT 10:40</a>, ""Whoever receives you, receives me."" See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/27'>MAT 16:27</a>."
NABRE,40,25,32,"[15] All the nations: before the end the gospel will have been preached throughout the world (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/14'>MAT 24:14</a>); thus the Gentiles will be judged on their response to it. But the phrase all the nationsincludes the Jews also, for at the judgment ""the Son of Man…will repay everyone according to his conduct"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/16/27'>MAT 16:27</a>)."
NABRE,40,25,37,[16] 25:37-40 The righteouswill be astonished that in caring for the needs of the sufferers they were ministering to the Lordhimself. One of these least brothers of mine: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/10/42'>MAT 10:42</a>.
NABRE,40,25,41,"[17] Fire prepared…his angels: cf. 1 Enoch <a href='/NABRE/40/10/13'>10:13</a> where it is said of the evil angels and Semyaza, their leader, ""In those days they will lead them into the bottom of the fire—and in torment—in the prison (where) they will be locked up forever."""
NABRE,40,25,44,[18] 25:44-45 The accursed(<a href='/NABRE/40/25/41'>MAT 25:41</a>) will be likewise astonished that their neglect of the sufferers was neglect of the Lordand will receive from him a similar answer.
NABRE,40,26,1,"[1] 26:1-28:20 The five books with alternating narrative and discourse (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/1'>MAT 3:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/25/46'>25:46</a>) that give this gospel its distinctive structure lead up to the climactic events that are the center of Christian belief and the origin of the Christian church, the passion and resurrection of Jesus. In his passion narrative (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/1'>MAT 26</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/26/27'>27</a>) Matthew follows his Marcan source closely but with omissions (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/41/14/51'>MAK 14:51-52</a>) and additions (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/40/27/3'>MAT 27:3-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/27/19'>19</a>). Some of the additions indicate that he utilized traditions that he had received from elsewhere; others are due to his own theological insight (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/40/26/28'>MAT 26:28</a> ""…for the forgiveness of sins""; <a href='/NABRE/40/27/52'>MAT 27:52</a>). In his editing Matthew also altered Mark in some minor details. But there is no need to suppose that he knew any passion narrative other than Marks."
NABRE,40,26,1,"[2] 26:1-2 When Jesus finished all these words: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/7/28'>MAT 7:28-29</a>. ""You know…crucified"": Matthew turns Marks statement of the time (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/1'>MAK 14:1</a>) into Jesus final prediction of his passion.

In accordance with the interpretation of this act as Jesus burialanointing, Matthew, more consistent than Mark, changes the purpose of the visit of the women to Jesus tomb; they do not go to anoint him (<a href='/NABRE/41/16/1'>MAK 16:1</a>) but ""to see the tomb"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/1'>MAT 28:1</a>)."

NABRE,40,26,15,"[8] The motive of avarice is introduced by Judass question about the price for betrayal, which is absent in the Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/10'>MAK 14:10-11</a>). Hand him over: the same Greek verb is used to express the saving purpose of God by which Jesus is handed over to death (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/17/22'>MAT 17:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/20/18'>20:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/2'>26:2</a>) and the human malice that hands him over. Thirty pieces of silver: the price of the betrayal is found only in Matthew. It is derived from <a href='/NABRE/38/11/12'>ZEC 11:12</a> where it is the wages paid to the rejected shepherd, a cheap price (<a href='/NABRE/38/11/13'>ZEC 11:13</a>). That amount is also the compensation paid to one whose slave has been gored by an ox (<a href='/NABRE/2/21/32'>EXO 21:32</a>)."
NABRE,40,26,17,"[9] The first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/14/1'>MAK 14:1</a>. Matthew omits Marks ""when they sacrificed the Passover lamb."""
NABRE,40,26,18,"[10] By omitting much of <a href='/NABRE/41/14/13'>MAK 14:13-15</a>, adding My appointed time draws near, and turning the question into a statement, in your house I shall celebrate the Passover, Matthew has given this passage a solemnity and majesty greater than that of his source."
NABRE,40,26,21,"[11] Given Matthews interest in the fulfillment of the Old Testament, it is curious that he omits the Marcan designation of Jesus betrayer as ""one who is eating with me"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/18'>MAK 14:18</a>), since that is probably an allusion to <a href='/NABRE/19/41/10'>PS 41:10</a>. However, the shocking fact that the betrayer is one who shares table fellowship with Jesus is emphasized in <a href='/NABRE/40/26/23'>MAT 26:23</a>."
NABRE,40,26,24,[12] It would be better…born: the enormity of the deed is such that it would be better not to exist than to do it.
NABRE,40,26,25,[13] Peculiar to Matthew. You have said so: cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/26/64'>MAT 26:64</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/27/11'>27:11</a>. This is a half-affirmative. Emphasis is laid on the pronoun and the answer implies that the statement would not have been made if the question had not been asked.
NABRE,40,26,26,"[14] 26:26-29 See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/14/22'>MAK 14:22-24</a>. The Marcan-Matthean is one of the two major New Testament traditions of the words of Jesus when instituting the Eucharist. The other (and earlier) is the Pauline-Lucan (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/23'>1CO 11:23-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/22/19'>LUK 22:19-20</a>). Each shows the influence of Christian liturgical usage, but the Marcan-Matthean is more developed in that regard than the Pauline-Lucan. The words over the bread and cup succeed each other without the intervening meal mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/46/11/25'>1CO 11:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/22/20'>LUK 22:20</a>; and there is parallelism between the consecratory words (this is my body…this is my blood). Matthew follows Mark closely but with some changes."
NABRE,40,26,26,"[15] See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/14/19'>MAT 14:19</a>. Said the blessing: a prayer blessing God. Take and eat: literally, Take, eat. Eatis an addition to Marks ""take it"" (literally, ""take""; <a href='/NABRE/41/14/22'>MAK 14:22</a>). This is my body: the bread is identified with Jesus himself."
NABRE,40,26,27,"[16] 26:27-28 Gave thanks: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/15/36'>MAT 15:36</a>. Gave it to them…all of you: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/23'>MAK 14:23-24</a>. In the Marcan sequence the disciples drink and then Jesus says the interpretative words. Matthew has changed this into a command to drinkfollowed by those words. My blood: see <a href='/NABRE/3/17/11'>LEV 17:11</a> for the concept that the bloodis ""the seat of life"" and that when placed on the altar it ""makes atonement."" Which will be shed: the present participle, ""being shed"" or ""going to be shed,"" is future in relation to the Last Supper. On behalf of: Greek peri; see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/14/24'>MAK 14:24</a>. Many: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/20/28'>MAT 20:28</a>. For the forgiveness of sins: a Matthean addition. The same phrase occurs in <a href='/NABRE/41/1/4'>MAK 1:4</a> in connection with Johns baptism but Matthew avoids it there (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/11'>MAT 3:11</a>). He places it here probably because he wishes to emphasize that it is the sacrificial death of Jesus that brings forgiveness of sins."
NABRE,40,26,29,"[17] Although his death will interrupt the table fellowship he has had with the disciples, Jesus confidently predicts his vindication by God and a new table fellowship with them at the banquet of the kingdom."

Jesus sorrow and distress(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/37'>MAT 26:37</a>) in face of death is unrelieved by the presence of his three disciples who, though urged to watch withhim (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/38'>MAT 26:38, 41</a>), fall asleep (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/40'>MAT 26:40, 43</a>).

Knowing then that his death must take place, he announces to his companions that the hourfor his being handed overhas come (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/45'>MAT 26:45</a>). Judas arrives with an armed band provided by the Sanhedrin and greets Jesus with a kiss, the prearranged sign for his identification (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/47'>MAT 26:47-49</a>). After his arrest, he rebukes a disciple who has attacked the high priests servantwith a sword(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/51'>MAT 26:51-54</a>), and chides those who have come out to seize him with swords and clubsas if he were a robber(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/55'>MAT 26:55-56</a>). In both rebukes Jesus declares that the treatment he is now receiving is the fulfillment of the scriptures (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/55'>MAT 26:55, 56</a>). The subsequent flight of all the disciplesis itself the fulfillment of his own prediction (cf. 31). In this episode, Matthew follows Mark with a few alterations."

In that verse ""the final test"" translates the same Greek word as is here translated the test, and these are the only instances of the use of that word in Matthew. It is possible that the passion of Jesus is seen here as an anticipation of the great tribulation that will precede the parousia (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/24/8'>MAT 24:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/21'>24:21</a>) to which <a href='/NABRE/40/6/13'>MAT 6:13</a> refers, and that just as Jesus prays to be delivered from death (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/39'>MAT 26:39</a>), so he exhorts the disciples to pray that they will not have to undergo thegreat testthat his passion would be for them. Some scholars, however, understand not undergo(literally, ""not enter"") the testas meaning not that the disciples may be spared the testbut that they may not yield to the temptation of falling away from Jesus because of his passion even though they will have to endure it."

NABRE,40,26,56,"[30] 26:57-68 Following <a href='/NABRE/41/14/53'>MAK 14:53-65</a> Matthew presents the nighttime appearance of Jesus before the Sanhedrinas a real trial. After many false witnessesbring charges against him that do not suffice for the death sentence (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/60'>MAT 26:60</a>), two came forwardwho charge him with claiming to be able to destroy the temple…and within three daysto rebuild it(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/60'>MAT 26:60-61</a>). Jesus makes no answer even when challenged to do so by the high priest, who then orders him to declare under oath…whetherhe is the Messiah, the Son of God(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/62'>MAT 26:62-63</a>). Matthew changes Marks clear affirmative response (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/62'>MAK 14:62</a>) to the same one as that given to Judas (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/25'>MAT 26:25</a>), but follows Mark almost verbatim in Jesus predicting that his judges will see him (the Son of Man) seated at the right hand ofGod and coming on the clouds of heaven(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/64'>MAT 26:64</a>). The high priestthen charges him with blasphemy (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/65'>MAT 26:65</a>), a charge with which the other members of the Sanhedrinagree by declaring that he deserves to die(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/66'>MAT 26:66</a>). They then attack him (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/67'>MAT 26:67</a>) and mockingly demand that he prophesy(<a href='/NABRE/40/26/68'>MAT 26:68</a>). This account contains elements that are contrary to the judicial procedures prescribed in the Mishnah, the Jewish code of law that dates in written form from ca. A.D. 200, e.g., trial on a feast day, a night session of the court, pronouncement of a verdict of condemnation at the same session at which testimony was received. Consequently, some scholars regard the account entirely as a creation of the early Christians without historical value. However, it is disputable whether the norms found in the Mishnah were in force at the time of Jesus. More to the point is the question whether the Matthean-Marcan night trial derives from a combination of two separate incidents, a nighttime preliminary investigation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/18/13'>JHN 18:13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/18/19'>19-24</a>) and a formal trial on the following morning (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/22/66'>LUK 22:66-71</a>)."

Matthew omits ""made with hands"" and ""not made with hands"" and changes Marks ""will destroy"" and ""will build another"" to can destroyand (can) rebuild. The charge is probably based on Jesus prediction of the temples destruction; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/23/37'>MAT 23:37-39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/2'>24:2</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/43/2/19'>JHN 2:19</a>.

According to the Mishnah, to be guilty of blasphemy one had to pronounce ""the Name itself,"" i.e., Yahweh; cf. Sanhedrin <a href='/NABRE/40/7/4'>7:4, 5</a>. Those who judge the gospel accounts of Jesus trial by the later Mishnah standards point out that Jesus uses the surrogate ""the Power,"" and hence no Jewish court would have regarded him as guilty of blasphemy; others hold that the Mishnahs narrow understanding of blasphemy was a later development."
NABRE,40,26,67,"[5] 26:67-68 The physical abuse, apparently done to Jesus by the members of the Sanhedrin themselves, recalls the sufferings of the Isaian Servant of the Lord; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/50/6'>ISA 50:6</a>.

Matthews account of the Roman trial before Pilateis introduced by a consultation of the Sanhedrin after which Jesus is handed over to…the governor(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/1'>MAT 27:1-2</a>). Matthew follows his Marcan source closely but adds some material that is peculiar to him, the death of Judas(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/3'>MAT 27:3-10</a>), possibly the name Jesusas the name of Barabbasalso (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/16'>MAT 27:16-17</a>), the intervention of Pilates wife(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/19'>MAT 27:19</a>), Pilates washing his handsin token of his disclaiming responsibility for Jesus death (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/24'>MAT 27:24</a>), and the assuming of that responsibility by the whole people(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/25'>MAT 27:25</a>)."
NABRE,40,27,1,"[2] There is scholarly disagreement about the meaning of the Sanhedrins taking counsel(symboulion elabon; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/12/14'>MAT 12:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/22/15'>22:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/27/7'>27:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/28/12'>28:12</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/15/1'>MAK 15:1</a>. Some understand it as a discussion about the strategy for putting their death sentence against Jesusinto effect since they lacked the right to do so themselves. Others see it as the occasion for their passing that sentence, holding that Matthew, unlike Mark (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/64'>MAK 14:64</a>), does not consider that it had been passed in the night session (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/66'>MAT 26:66</a>). Even in the latter interpretation, their handing him over to Pilateis best explained on the hypothesis that they did not have competence to put their sentence into effect, as is stated in <a href='/NABRE/43/18/31'>JHN 18:31</a>."

The two traditions agree only in the purchase of a field with the moneypaid to Judas for his betrayal of Jesus and the name given to the field, the Field of Blood. In Acts Judas himself buys the field and its name comes from his own blood shed in his fatal accident on it. The potters field: this designation of the field is based on the fulfillment citation in <a href='/NABRE/40/27/10'>MAT 27:10</a>."
NABRE,40,27,9,"[5] 27:9-10 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/26/15'>MAT 26:15</a>. Matthews attributing this text to Jeremiah is puzzling, for there is no such text in that book, and the thirty pieces of silverthrown by Judas ""into the temple"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/5'>MAT 27:5</a>) recall rather <a href='/NABRE/38/11/12'>ZEC 11:12-13</a>. It is usually said that the attribution of the text to Jeremiah is due to Matthews combining the Zechariah text with texts from Jeremiah that speak of a potter(<a href='/NABRE/24/18/2'>JER 18:2-3</a>), the buying of a field(<a href='/NABRE/24/32/6'>JER 32:6-9</a>), or the breaking of a potters flask at Topheth in the valley of Ben-Hinnom with the prediction that it will become a burial place (<a href='/NABRE/24/19/1'>JER 19:1-13</a>)."

The normal political connotation of both titles would be of concern to the Roman governor. You say so: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/26/25'>MAT 26:25</a>. An unqualified affirmative response is not made because Jesus kingship is not what Pilate would understand it to be."

This custom is mentioned also in <a href='/NABRE/41/15/6'>MAK 15:6</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/18/39'>JHN 18:39</a> but not in Luke; see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/23/17'>LUK 23:17</a>.

NABRE,40,27,16,"[9] 27:16-17 [Jesus] Barabbas: it is possible that the double name is the original reading; Jesuswas a common Jewish name; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/1/21'>MAT 1:21</a>. This reading is found in only a few textual witnesses, although its absence in the majority can be explained as an omission of Jesusmade for reverential reasons. That name is bracketed because of its uncertain textual attestation. The Aramaic name Barabbasmeans ""son of the father""; the irony of the choice offered between him and Jesus, the true son of the Father, would be evident to those addressees of Matthew who knew that."
NABRE,40,27,18,"[10] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/10'>MAK 14:10</a>. This is an example of the tendency, found in varying degree in all the gospels, to present Pilate in a relatively favorable light and emphasize the hostility of the Jewish authorities and eventually of the people."

The Marcan parallel, ""Crucify him"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/15/3'>MAK 15:3</a>), addressed to Pilate, is changed by Matthew to the passive, probably to emphasize the responsibility of the crowds."
NABRE,40,27,24,"[13] 27:24-25 Peculiar to Matthew. Took water…blood: cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/21/1'>DEU 21:1-8</a>, the handwashing prescribed in the case of a murder when the killer is unknown.

The whole people: Matthew sees in those who speak these words theentire people(Greek laos) of Israel. His blood…and upon our children: cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/26/15'>JER 26:15</a>.

NABRE,40,27,47,"[29] Elijah: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/4'>MAT 3:4</a>. This prophet, taken up into heaven (<a href='/NABRE/12/2/11'>2KG 2:11</a>), was believed to come to the help of those in distress, but the evidences of that belief are all later than the gospels."
NABRE,40,27,50,"[30] Gave up his spirit: cf. the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/15/37'>MAK 15:37</a>), ""breathed his last."" Matthews alteration expresses both Jesus control over his destiny and his obedient giving up of his life to God."
NABRE,40,27,51,"[31] 27:51-53 Veil of the sanctuary…bottom: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/15/38'>MAK 15:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/23/45'>LUK 23:45</a>. Luke puts this event immediately before the death of Jesus. There were two veils in the Mosaic tabernacle on the model of which the temple was constructed, the outer one before the entrance of the Holy Place and the inner one before the Holy of Holies (see <a href='/NABRE/2/26/31'>EXO 26:31-36</a>). Only the high priest could pass through the latter and that only on the Day of Atonement (see <a href='/NABRE/3/16/1'>LEV 16:1-18</a>). Probably the torn veil of the gospels is the inner one. The meaning of the scene may be that now, because of Jesus death, all people have access to the presence of God, or that the temple, its holiest part standing exposed, is now profaned and will soon be destroyed. The earth quaked…appeared to many: peculiar to Matthew. The earthquake, the splitting of the rocks, and especially the resurrection of the dead saintsindicate the coming of the final age. In the Old Testament the coming of God is frequently portrayed with the imagery of an earthquake (see <a href='/NABRE/19/68/9'>PS 68:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/77/19'>77:19</a>), and Jesus speaks of the earthquakes that will accompany the ""labor pains"" that signify the beginning of the dissolution of the old world (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/7'>MAT 24:7-8</a>). For the expectation of the resurrection of the dead at the coming of the new and final age, see <a href='/NABRE/27/12/1'>DAN 12:1-3</a>. Matthew knows that the end of the old age has not yet come (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/20'>MAT 28:20</a>), but the new age has broken in with the death (and resurrection; cf. the earthquake in <a href='/NABRE/40/28/2'>MAT 28:2</a>) of Jesus; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/28'>MAT 16:28</a>. After his resurrection: this qualification seems to be due to Matthews wish to assert the primacy of Jesus resurrectioneven though he has placed the resurrection of the dead saintsimmediately after Jesus death."
NABRE,40,27,54,"[32] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/15/39'>MAK 15:39</a>. The Christian confession of faith is made by Gentiles, not only the centurion, as in Mark, but the other soldiers who were keeping watch over Jesus(cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/27/36'>MAT 27:36</a>)."
NABRE,40,27,55,[1] 27:55-56 Looking on from a distance: cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/38/12'>PS 38:12</a>. Mary Magdalene…Joseph: these two women are mentioned again in <a href='/NABRE/40/27/61'>MAT 27:61</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/28/1'>MAT 28:1</a> and are important as witnesses of the reality of the empty tomb. A Jamesand Josephare referred to in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/55'>MAT 13:55</a> as brothers of Jesus.
NABRE,40,27,56,"[2] 27:57-61 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/15/42'>MAK 15:42-47</a>. Matthew drops Marks designation of Josephof Arimatheaas ""a distinguished member of the council"" (the Sanhedrin), and makes him a rich manand a disciple of Jesus. The former may be an allusion to <a href='/NABRE/23/53/9'>ISA 53:9</a> (the Hebrew reading of that text is disputed and the one followed in the NAB OT has nothing about the rich, but they are mentioned in the LXX version). That the tomb was the new tombof a rich manand that it was seen by the women are indications of an apologetic intent of Matthew; there could be no question about the identity of Jesus burial place. The other Mary: the mother of James and Joseph (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/56'>MAT 27:56</a>)."
NABRE,40,27,61,"[3] 27:62-66 Peculiar to Matthew. The story prepares for <a href='/NABRE/40/28/11'>MAT 28:11-15</a> and the Jewish charge that the tomb was empty because the disciples had stolen the body of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/13'>MAT 28:13, 15</a>)."
NABRE,40,27,62,"[4] The next day…preparation: the sabbath. According to the synoptic chronology, in that year the day of preparation(for the sabbath) was the Passover; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/15/42'>MAK 15:42</a>. The Pharisees: the principal opponents of Jesus during his ministry and, in Matthews time, of the Christian church, join with the chief prieststo guarantee against a possible attempt of Jesus disciplesto steal his body."
NABRE,40,27,64,[5] This last imposture…the first: the claim that Jesus has been raised from the deadis clearly the last imposture; the firstmay be either his claim that he would be raised up(<a href='/NABRE/40/27/63'>MAT 27:63</a>) or his claim that he was the one with whose ministry the kingdom of God had come (see <a href='/NABRE/40/12/28'>MAT 12:28</a>).
NABRE,40,27,65,"[6] The guard is yours: literally, ""have a guard"" or ""you have a guard."" Either the imperative or the indicative could mean that Pilate granted the petitioners some Roman soldiers as guards, which is the sense of the present translation. However, if the verb is taken as an indicative it could also mean that Pilate told them to use their own Jewish guards."
NABRE,40,28,1,"[1] After the sabbath…dawning: since the sabbath ended at sunset, this could mean in the early evening, for dawningcan refer to the appearance of the evening star; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/23/54'>LUK 23:54</a>. However, it is probable that Matthew means the morning dawn of the day after the sabbath, as in the similar though slightly different text of Mark, ""when the sun had risen"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/16/2'>MAK 16:2</a>). Mary Magdalene and the other Mary: see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/55'>MAT 27:55-56</a>; 57-61. To see the tomb: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/16/1'>MAK 16:1-2</a> where the purpose of the womens visit is to anoint Jesus body."
NABRE,40,28,2,"[2] 28:2-4 Peculiar to Matthew. A great earthquake: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/51'>MAT 27:51-53</a>. Descended from heaven: this trait is peculiar to Matthew, although his interpretation of the ""young man"" of his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/16/5'>MAK 16:5</a>) as an angelis probably true to Marks intention; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/24/23'>LUK 24:23</a> where the ""two men"" of <a href='/NABRE/40/24/4'>MAT 24:4</a> are said to be ""angels."" Rolled back the stone…upon it: not to allow the risen Jesus to leave the tomb but to make evident that the tomb is empty (see <a href='/NABRE/40/24/6'>MAT 24:6</a>). Unlike the apocryphal Gospel of Peter (<a href='/NABRE/40/9/35'>9:35</a>—11:44), the New Testament does not describe the resurrection of Jesus, nor is there anyone who sees it. His appearance was like lightning…snow: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/17/2'>MAT 17:2</a>."
NABRE,40,28,6,"[3] 28:6-7 Cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/16/6'>MAK 16:6-7</a>. Just as he said: a Matthean addition referring to Jesus predictions of his resurrection, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/40/16/21'>MAT 16:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/17/23'>17:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/20/19'>20:19</a>. Tell his disciples: like the angel of the Lord of the infancy narrative, the angel interprets a fact and gives a commandment about what is to be done; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/1/20'>MAT 1:20-21</a>. Matthew omits Marks ""and Peter"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/16/7'>MAK 16:7</a>); considering his interest in Peter, this omission is curious. Perhaps the reason is that the Marcan text may allude to a first appearance of Jesus to Peter alone (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>1CO 15:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/34'>LUK 24:34</a>) which Matthew has already incorporated into his account of Peters confession at Caesarea Philippi; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/16'>MAT 16:16</a>. He is going…Galilee: like <a href='/NABRE/41/16/7'>MAK 16:7</a>, a reference to Jesus prediction at the Last Supper (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/32'>MAT 26:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/14/28'>MAK 14:28</a>). Matthew changes Marks ""as he told you"" to a declaration of the angel."
NABRE,40,28,8,"[4] Contrast <a href='/NABRE/41/16/8'>MAK 16:8</a> where the women in their fear ""said nothing to anyone."""
NABRE,40,28,9,"[5] 28:9-10 Although these verses are peculiar to Matthew, there are similarities between them and Johns account of the appearance of Jesus to Mary Magdalene (<a href='/NABRE/43/20/17'>JHN 20:17</a>). In both there is a touching of Jesus body, and a command of Jesus to bear a message to his disciples, designated as his brothers. Matthew may have drawn upon a tradition that appears in a different form in John. Jesus words to the women are mainly a repetition of those of the angel (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/5'>MAT 28:5</a>a, 7b)."
NABRE,40,28,10,[6] 28:11-15 This account indicates that the dispute between Christians and Jews about the empty tomb was not whether the tomb was empty but why.
NABRE,40,28,15,"[7] 28:16-20 This climactic scene has been called a ""proleptic parousia,"" for it gives a foretaste of the final glorious coming of the Son of Man (<a href='/NABRE/40/26/64'>MAT 26:64</a>). Then his triumph will be manifest to all; now it is revealed only to the disciples, who are commissioned to announce it to all nationsand bring them to belief in Jesus and obedience to his commandments."
NABRE,40,28,16,"[8] The eleven: the number recalls the tragic defection of Judas Iscariot. To the mountain…ordered them: since the message to the discipleswas simply that they were to go to Galilee (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/10'>MAT 28:10</a>), some think that the mountaincomes from a tradition of the message known to Matthew and alluded to here. For the significance of the mountain, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/17/1'>MAT 17:1</a>."
NABRE,40,28,17,"[9] But they doubted: the Greek can also be translated, ""but some doubted."" The verb occurs elsewhere in the New Testament only in <a href='/NABRE/40/14/31'>MAT 14:31</a> where it is associated with Peters being of ""little faith."" For the meaning of that designation, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/6/30'>MAT 6:30</a>."
NABRE,40,28,18,"[10] All power…me: the Greek word here translated poweris the same as that found in the LXX translation of <a href='/NABRE/27/7/13'>DAN 7:13-14</a> where one ""like a son of man"" is given powerand an everlasting kingdom by God. The risen Jesus here claims universal power, i.e., in heaven and on earth."
NABRE,40,28,19,"[11] Therefore: since universal power belongs to the risen Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/18'>MAT 28:18</a>), he gives the eleven a mission that is universal. They are to make disciples of all nations. While all nationsis understood by some scholars as referring only to all Gentiles, it is probable that it included the Jews as well. Baptizing them: baptism is the means of entrance into the community of the risen one, the Church. In the name of the Father…holy Spirit: this is perhaps the clearest expression in the New Testament of trinitarian belief. It may have been the baptismal formula of Matthews church, but primarily it designates the effect of baptism, the union of the one baptized with the Father, Son, and holy Spirit."
NABRE,40,28,20,"[12] All that I have commanded you: the moral teaching found in this gospel, preeminently that of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>MAT 5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/7/1'>7</a>). The commandments of Jesus are the standard of Christian conduct, not the Mosaic law as such, even though some of the Mosaic commandments have now been invested with the authority of Jesus. Behold, I am with you always: the promise of Jesus real though invisible presence echoes the name Emmanuel given to him in the infancy narrative; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/1/23'>MAT 1:23</a>. End of the age: see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/39'>MAT 13:39</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/24/3'>MAT 24:3</a>."
NABRE,41,1,1,"[1] 1:1-13 The prologue of the Gospel according to Mark begins with the title (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/1'>MAK 1:1</a>) followed by three events preparatory to Jesus preaching: (1) the appearance in the Judean wilderness of John, baptizer, preacher of repentance, and precursor of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/2'>MAK 1:2-8</a>); (2) the baptism of Jesus, at which a voice from heaven acknowledges Jesus to be Gods Son, and the holy Spirit descends on him (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/9'>MAK 1:9-11</a>); (3) the temptation of Jesus by Satan (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/12'>MAK 1:12-13</a>)."
NABRE,41,1,1,"[2] The gospel of Jesus Christ [the Son of God]: the ""good news"" of salvation in and through Jesus, crucified and risen, acknowledged by the Christian community as Messiah (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/29'>MAK 8:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/14/61'>14:61-62</a>) and Son of God (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/11'>MAK 1:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/9/7'>9:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/15/39'>15:39</a>), although some important manuscripts here omit the Son of God."
NABRE,41,1,2,"[3] 1:2-3 Although Mark attributes the prophecy to Isaiah, the text is a combination of <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/40/3'>ISA 40:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/23/20'>EXO 23:20</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/11/10'>MAT 11:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/27'>LUK 7:27</a>. Johns ministry is seen as Gods prelude to the saving mission of his Son. The way of the Lord: this prophecy of Deutero-Isaiah concerning the end of the Babylonian exile is here applied to the coming of Jesus; John the Baptist is to prepare the way for him."
NABRE,41,1,6,[4] Clothed in camels hair…waist: the Baptists garb recalls that of Elijah in <a href='/NABRE/12/1/8'>2KG 1:8</a>. Jesus speaks of the Baptist as Elijah who has already come (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/11'>MAK 9:11-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/17/10'>MAT 17:10-12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/39/3/23'>MAL 3:23-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/1/17'>LUK 1:17</a>).
NABRE,41,1,8,"[5] 1:8-9 Through the life-giving baptism with the holy Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/8'>MAK 1:8</a>), Jesus will create a new people of God. But first he identifies himself with the people of Israel in submitting to Johns baptism of repentance and in bearing on their behalf the burden of Gods decisive judgment (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/9'>MAK 1:9</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/1/4'>MAK 1:4</a>). As in the desert of Sinai, so here in the wilderness of Judea, Israels sonship with God is to be renewed."
NABRE,41,1,10,"[6] 1:10-11 He saw the heavens…and the Spirit…upon him: indicating divine intervention in fulfillment of promise. Here the descent of the Spirit on Jesus is meant, anointing him for his ministry; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/2'>ISA 11:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>42:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/61/1'>61:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/63/9'>63:9</a>. A voice…with you I am well pleased: Gods acknowledgment of Jesus as his unique Son, the object of his love. His approval of Jesus is the assurance that Jesus will fulfill his messianic mission of salvation."
NABRE,41,1,11,[7] 1:12-13 The same Spirit who descended on Jesus in his baptism now drives him into the desert for forty days. The result is radical confrontation and temptation by Satan who attempts to frustrate the work of God. The presence of wild beasts may indicate the horror and danger of the desert regarded as the abode of demons or may reflect the paradise motif of harmony among all creatures; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/6'>ISA 11:6-9</a>. The presence of ministering angels to sustain Jesus recalls the angel who guided the Israelites in the desert in the first Exodus (<a href='/NABRE/2/14/19'>EXO 14:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/23/20'>23:20</a>) and the angel who supplied nourishment to Elijah in the wilderness (<a href='/NABRE/11/19/5'>1KG 19:5-7</a>). The combined forces of good and evil were present to Jesus in the desert. His sustained obedience brings forth the new Israel of God there where Israels rebellion had brought death and alienation.
NABRE,41,1,14,"[8] 1:14-15 After John had been arrested: in the plan of God, Jesus was not to proclaim the good news of salvation prior to the termination of the Baptists active mission. Galilee: in the Marcan account, scene of the major part of Jesus public ministry before his arrest and condemnation. The gospel of God: not only the good news from God but about God at work in Jesus Christ. This is the time of fulfillment: i.e., of Gods promises. The kingdom of God…Repent: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/3/2'>MAT 3:2</a>."
NABRE,41,1,15,[9] 1:16-20 These verses narrate the call of the first Disciples. See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/4/18'>MAT 4:18-22</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/4/20'>MAT 4:20</a>.
NABRE,41,1,21,"[10] 1:21-45 The account of a single days ministry of Jesus on a sabbath in and outside the synagogue of Capernaum (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/21'>MAK 1:21-31</a>) combines teaching and miracles of exorcism and healing. Mention is not made of the content of the teaching but of the effect of astonishment and alarm on the people. Jesus teaching with authority, making an absolute claim on the hearer, was in the best tradition of the ancient prophets, not of the scribes. The narrative continues with events that evening (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/32'>MAK 1:32-34</a>; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/14'>MAT 8:14-17</a>) and the next day (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/35'>MAK 1:35-39</a>). The cleansing in <a href='/NABRE/41/1/40'>MAK 1:40-45</a> stands as an isolated story."
NABRE,41,1,23,"[11] An unclean spirit: so called because of the spirits resistance to the holiness of God. The spirit knows and fears the power of Jesus to destroy his influence; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/1/32'>MAK 1:32, 34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/3/11'>3:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/6/13'>6:13</a>."
NABRE,41,1,24,"[12] 1:24-25 The Holy One of God: not a confession but an attempt to ward off Jesus power, reflecting the notion that use of the precise name of an opposing spirit would guarantee mastery over him. Jesus silenced the cry of the unclean spirit and drove him out of the man."
NABRE,41,1,24,[13] What have you to do with us?: see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/2/4'>JHN 2:4</a>.
NABRE,41,1,40,"[14] A leper: for the various forms of skin disease, see <a href='/NABRE/3/13/1'>LEV 13:1-50</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/3/13/2'>LEV 13:2-4</a>. There are only two instances in the Old Testament in which God is shown to have cured a leper (<a href='/NABRE/4/12/10'>NUM 12:10-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/5/1'>2KG 5:1-14</a>). The law of Moses provided for the ritual purification of a leper. In curing the leper, Jesus assumes that the priests will reinstate the cured man into the religious community. See also note on <a href='/NABRE/42/5/14'>LUK 5:14</a>."
NABRE,41,2,1,[1] 2:1-3:6 This section relates a series of conflicts between Jesus and the scribes and Pharisees in which the growing opposition of the latter leads to their plot to put Jesus to death (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/6'>MAK 3:6</a>).
NABRE,41,2,1,"[2] 2:1-2 He was at home: to the crowds that gathered in and outside the house Jesus preached the word, i.e., the gospel concerning the nearness of the kingdom and the necessity of repentance and faith (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/14'>MAK 1:14</a>)."
NABRE,41,2,5,[3] It was the faith of the paralytic and those who carried him that moved Jesus to heal the sick man. Accounts of other miracles of Jesus reveal more and more his emphasis on faith as the requisite for exercising his healing powers (<a href='/NABRE/41/5/34'>MAK 5:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/9/23'>9:23-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/10/52'>10:52</a>).

NABRE,41,2,7,[5] He is blaspheming: an accusation made here and repeated during the trial of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/60'>MAK 14:60-64</a>).
NABRE,41,2,10,"[6] But that you may know that the Son of Man…on earth: although <a href='/NABRE/41/2/8'>MAK 2:8-9</a> are addressed to the scribes, the sudden interruption of thought and structure in <a href='/NABRE/41/2/10'>MAK 2:10</a> seems not addressed to them nor to the paralytic. Moreover, the early public use of the designation ""Son of Man"" to unbelieving scribes is most unlikely. The most probable explanation is that Marks insertion of <a href='/NABRE/41/2/10'>MAK 2:10</a> is a commentary addressed to Christians for whom he recalls this miracle and who already accept in faith that Jesus is Messiah and Son of God."
NABRE,41,2,13,[7] He taught them: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/1/21'>MAK 1:21-45</a>.

Customs post: such tax collectors paid a fixed sum for the right to collect customs duties within their districts. Since whatever they could collect above this amount constituted their profit, the abuse of extortion was widespread among them. Hence, Jewish customs officials were regarded as sinners (<a href='/NABRE/41/2/16'>MAK 2:16</a>), outcasts of society, and disgraced along with their families. He got up and followed him: i.e., became a disciple of Jesus."

NABRE,41,2,16,"[10] 2:16-17 This and the following conflict stories reflect a similar pattern: a statement of fact, a question of protest, and a reply by Jesus."
NABRE,41,2,17,"[11] Do not need a physician: this maxim of Jesus with its implied irony was uttered to silence his adversaries who objected that he ate with tax collectors and sinners(<a href='/NABRE/41/2/16'>MAK 2:16</a>). Because the scribes and Pharisees were self-righteous, they were not capable of responding to Jesus call to repentance and faith in the gospel."
NABRE,41,2,17,[12] 2:18-22 This conflict over the question of fasting has the same pattern as <a href='/NABRE/41/2/16'>MAK 2:16-17</a>; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/15'>MAT 9:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/9/16'>9:16-17</a>.
NABRE,41,2,19,"[13] Can the wedding guests fast?: the bridal metaphor expresses a new relationship of love between God and his people in the person and mission of Jesus to his disciples. It is the inauguration of the new and joyful messianic time of fulfillment and the passing of the old. Any attempt at assimilating the Pharisaic practice of fasting, or of extending the preparatory discipline of Johns disciples beyond the arrival of the bridegroom, would be as futile as sewing a piece of unshrunken cloth on an old cloakor pouring new wine into old wineskinswith the resulting destruction of both cloth and wine (<a href='/NABRE/41/2/21'>MAK 2:21-22</a>). Fasting is rendered superfluous during the earthly ministry of Jesus; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/2/20'>MAK 2:20</a>."
NABRE,41,2,22,[14] 2:23-28 This conflict regarding the sabbath follows the same pattern as in <a href='/NABRE/41/2/18'>MAK 2:18-22</a>.
NABRE,41,2,25,"[15] 2:25-26 Have you never read what David did?: Jesus defends the action of his disciples on the basis of <a href='/NABRE/9/21/2'>1SM 21:2-7</a> in which an exception is made to the regulation of <a href='/NABRE/3/24/9'>LEV 24:9</a> because of the extreme hunger of David and his men. According to 1 Samuel, the priest who gave the bread to David was Ahimelech, father of Abiathar."
NABRE,41,2,27,[16] The sabbath was made for man: a reaffirmation of the divine intent of the sabbath to benefit Israel as contrasted with the restrictive Pharisaic tradition added to the law.
NABRE,41,2,28,[17] The Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath: Marks comment on the theological meaning of the incident is to benefit his Christian readers; see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/2/10'>MAK 2:10</a>.
NABRE,41,3,1,[1] 3:1-5 Here Jesus is again depicted in conflict with his adversaries over the question of sabbath-day observance. His opponents were already ill disposed toward him because they regarded Jesus as a violator of the sabbath. Jesus question Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath rather than to do evil?places the matter in the broader theological context outside the casuistry of the scribes. The answer is obvious. Jesus heals the man with the withered hand in the sight of all and reduces his opponents to silence; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/5/17'>JHN 5:17-18</a>.
NABRE,41,3,6,"[2] In reporting the plot of the Pharisees and Herodians to put Jesus to death after this series of conflicts in Galilee, Mark uses a pattern that recurs in his account of later controversies in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/41/11/17'>MAK 11:17-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/12/13'>12:13-17</a>). The help of the Herodians, supporters of Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, is needed to take action against Jesus. Both series of conflicts point to their gravity and to the impending passion of Jesus."
NABRE,41,3,7,[3] 3:7-19 This overview of the Galilean ministry manifests the power of Jesus to draw people to himself through his teaching and deeds of power. The crowds of Jews from many regions surround Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/7'>MAK 3:7-12</a>). This phenomenon prepares the way for creating a new people of Israel. The choice and mission of the Twelve is the prelude (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/13'>MAK 3:13-19</a>).
NABRE,41,3,11,[4] 3:11-12 See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/1/24'>MAK 1:24-25</a>.
NABRE,41,3,13,[5] He went up the mountain: here and elsewhere the mountain is associated with solemn moments and acts in the mission and self-revelation of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/46'>MAK 6:46</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/9/2'>9:2-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/13/3'>13:3</a>). Jesus acts with authority as he summoned those whom he wanted and they came to him.
NABRE,41,3,14,"[6] 3:14-15 He appointed twelve [whom he also named apostles] that they might be with him: literally ""he made,"" i.e., instituted them as apostles to extend his messianic mission through them (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/7'>MAK 6:7-13</a>). See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/10/1'>MAT 10:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/10/2'>10:2-4</a>."
NABRE,41,3,16,"[7] Simon, whom he named Peter: Mark indicates that Simons name was changed on this occasion. Peter is first in all lists of the apostles (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/2'>MAT 10:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/14'>LUK 6:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/1/13'>ACT 1:13</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>1CO 15:5-8</a>)."
NABRE,41,3,20,"[8] 3:20-35 Within the narrative of the coming of Jesus relatives (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/20'>MAK 3:20-21</a>) is inserted the account of the unbelieving scribes from Jerusalem who attributed Jesus power over demons to Beelzebul (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/22'>MAK 3:22-30</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/5/21'>MAK 5:21-43</a>. There were those even among the relatives of Jesus who disbelieved and regarded Jesus as out of his mind(<a href='/NABRE/41/3/21'>MAK 3:21</a>). Against this background, Jesus is informed of the arrival of his mother and brothers [and sisters] (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/32'>MAK 3:32</a>). He responds by showing that not family ties but doing Gods will (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/35'>MAK 3:35</a>) is decisive in the kingdom; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/40/12/46'>MAT 12:46-50</a>."

NABRE,41,3,22,[10] By Beelzebul: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/10/25'>MAT 10:25</a>. Two accusations are leveled against Jesus: (1) that he is possessedby an unclean spirit and (2) by the prince of demons he drives out demons. Jesus answers the second charge by a parable (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/24'>MAK 3:24-27</a>) and responds to the first charge in <a href='/NABRE/41/3/28'>MAK 3:28-29</a>.
NABRE,41,3,29,"[11] Whoever blasphemes against the holy Spirit: this sin is called an everlasting sinbecause it attributes to Satan, who is the power of evil, what is actually the work of the holy Spirit, namely, victory over the demons."

NABRE,41,4,1,"[1] 4:1-34 In parables(<a href='/NABRE/41/4/2'>MAK 4:2</a>): see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/3'>MAT 13:3</a>. The use of parables is typical of Jesus enigmatic method of teaching the crowds (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/2'>MAK 4:2-9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/4/12'>12</a>) as compared with the interpretation of the parables he gives to his disciples (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/10'>MAK 4:10-25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/4/33'>33-34</a>) to each group according to its capacity to understand (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/9'>MAK 4:9-11</a>). The key feature of the parable at hand is the sowing of the seed (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/3'>MAK 4:3</a>), representing the breakthrough of the kingdom of God into the world. The various types of soil refer to the diversity of response accorded the word of God (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/4'>MAK 4:4-7</a>). The climax of the parable is the harvest of thirty, sixty, and a hundredfold, indicating the consummation of the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/8'>MAK 4:8</a>). Thus both the present and the future action of God, from the initiation to the fulfillment of the kingdom, is presented through this and other parables (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/26'>MAK 4:26-29</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/4/30'>30-32</a>)."
NABRE,41,4,1,[2] By the sea: the shore of the Sea of Galilee or a boat near the shore (<a href='/NABRE/41/2/13'>MAK 2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/3/7'>3:7-8</a>) is the place where Mark depicts Jesus teaching the crowds. By contrast the mountain is the scene of Jesus at prayer (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/46'>MAK 6:46</a>) or in the process of forming his disciples (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/13'>MAK 3:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/9/2'>9:2</a>).

NABRE,41,4,11,"[4] 4:11-12 These verses are to be viewed against their background in <a href='/NABRE/41/3/6'>MAK 3:6, 22</a> concerning the unbelief and opposition Jesus encountered in his ministry. It is against this background that the distinction in Jesus method becomes clear of presenting the kingdom to the disbelieving crowd in one manner and to the disciples in another. To the former it is presented in parables and the truth remains hidden; for the latter the parable is interpreted and the mystery is partially revealed because of their faith; see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/11'>MAT 13:11</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/13/13'>MAT 13:13</a>."

NABRE,41,4,26,[6] 4:26-29 Only Mark records the parable of the seeds growth. Sower and harvester are the same. The emphasis is on the power of the seed to grow of itself without human intervention (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/27'>MAK 4:27</a>). Mysteriously it produces bladeand earand full grain(<a href='/NABRE/41/4/28'>MAK 4:28</a>). Thus the kingdom of God initiated by Jesus in proclaiming the word develops quietly yet powerfully until it is fully established by him at the final judgment (<a href='/NABRE/41/4/29'>MAK 4:29</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/66/14/15'>REV 14:15</a>.
NABRE,41,4,32,[7] The universality of the kingdom of God is indicated here; cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/17/23'>EZE 17:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/31/6'>31:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/4/17'>DAN 4:17-19</a>.
NABRE,41,4,35,"[8] 4:35-5:43 After the chapter on parables, Mark narrates four miracle stories: <a href='/NABRE/41/4/35'>MAK 4:35-41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/5/1'>5:1-20</a>; and two joined together in <a href='/NABRE/41/5/21'>MAK 5:21-43</a>.

NABRE,41,4,39,"[9] Quiet! Be still!: as in the case of silencing a demon (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/25'>MAK 1:25</a>), Jesus rebukes the wind and subdues the turbulence of the sea by a mere word; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/26'>MAT 8:26</a>."
NABRE,41,4,41,[10] Jesus is here depicted as exercising power over wind and sea. In the Christian community this event was seen as a sign of Jesus saving presence amid persecutions that threatened its existence.
NABRE,41,5,1,"[1] The territory of the Gerasenes: the reference is to pagan territory; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/65/1'>ISA 65:1</a>. Another reading is ""Gadarenes""; see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/28'>MAT 8:28</a>."

NABRE,41,5,20,[7] 5:21-43 The story of the raising to life of Jairuss daughter is divided into two parts: <a href='/NABRE/41/5/21'>MAK 5:21-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/5/35'>5:35-43</a>. Between these two separated parts the account of the cure of the hemorrhage victim (<a href='/NABRE/41/5/25'>MAK 5:25-34</a>) is interposed.

NABRE,41,5,35,"[10] The faith of Jairus was put to a twofold test: (1) that his daughter might be cured and, now that she had died, (2) that she might be restored to life. His faith contrasts with the lack of faith of the crowd."
NABRE,41,5,39,[11] Not dead but asleep: the New Testament often refers to death as sleep (<a href='/NABRE/40/27/52'>MAT 27:52</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/11/11'>JHN 11:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/15/6'>1CO 15:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/4/13'>1TS 4:13-15</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/24'>MAT 9:24</a>.

NABRE,41,6,3,"[3] Is he not the carpenter?: no other gospel calls Jesus a carpenter. Some witnesses have ""the carpenters son,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/55'>MAT 13:55</a>. Son of Mary: contrary to Jewish custom, which calls a man the son of his father, this expression may reflect Marks own faith that God is the Father of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/1'>MAK 1:1, 11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/8/38'>8:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/13/32'>13:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/14/36'>14:36</a>). The brother of James…Simon: in Semitic usage, the terms ""brother,"" ""sister"" are applied not only to children of the same parents, but to nephews, nieces, cousins, half-brothers, and half-sisters; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/14/16'>GEN 14:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/29/15'>29:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/10/4'>LEV 10:4</a>. While one cannot suppose that the meaning of a Greek word should be sought in the first place from Semitic usage, the Septuagint often translates the Hebrew āhby the Greek word adelphos, ""brother,"" as in the cited passages, a fact that may argue for a similar breadth of meaning in some New Testament passages. For instance, there is no doubt that in v 17, ""brother"" is used of Philip, who was actually the half-brother of Herod Antipas. On the other hand, Mark may have understood the terms literally; see also <a href='/NABRE/41/3/31'>MAK 3:31-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/12/46'>MAT 12:46</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/13/55'>13:55-56</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/19'>LUK 8:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/7/3'>JHN 7:3, 5</a>.

NABRE,41,6,4,"[4] A prophet is not without honor except…in his own house: a saying that finds parallels in other literatures, especially Jewish and Greek, but without reference to a prophet. Comparing himself to previous Hebrew prophets whom the people rejected, Jesus intimates his own eventual rejection by the nation especially in view of the dishonor his own relatives had shown him (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/21'>MAK 3:21</a>) and now his townspeople as well."

NABRE,41,6,7,"[6] 6:7-13 The preparation for the mission of the Twelve is seen in the call (1) of the first disciples to be fishers of men (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/16'>MAK 1:16-20</a>), (2) then of the Twelve set apart to be with Jesus and to receive authority to preach and expel demons (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/13'>MAK 3:13-19</a>).

Mark does not mention any prohibition to visit pagan territory and to enter Samaritan towns. These differences indicate a certain adaptation to conditions in and outside of Palestine and suggest in Marks account a later activity in the church. For the rest, Jesus required of his apostles a total dependence on God for food and shelter; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/6/35'>MAK 6:35-44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/8/1'>8:1-9</a>."

Herod and Pilate, each in turn, acknowledges the holiness of life of one over whom he unjustly exercises the power of condemnation and death (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/26'>MAK 6:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/15/9'>15:9-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/15/14'>14-15</a>).

NABRE,41,6,46,[21] He went off to the mountain to pray: see <a href='/NABRE/41/1/35'>MAK 1:35-38</a>. In <a href='/NABRE/43/6/15'>JHN 6:15</a> Jesus withdrew to evade any involvement in the false messianic hopes of the multitude.

NABRE,41,6,50,"[23] It is I, do not be afraid!: literally, ""I am."" This may reflect the divine revelatory formula of <a href='/NABRE/2/3/14'>EXO 3:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/41/4'>ISA 41:4, 10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/41/14'>14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/1'>43:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/43/10'>10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/43/13'>13</a>. Mark implies the hidden identity of Jesus as Son of God."
NABRE,41,6,52,[24] They had not understood…the loaves: the revelatory character of this sign and that of the walking on the sea completely escaped the disciples. Their hearts were hardened: in <a href='/NABRE/41/3/5'>MAK 3:5-6</a> hardness of heart was attributed to those who did not accept Jesus and plotted his death. Here the same disposition prevents the disciples from comprehending Jesus self-revelation through signs; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/8/17'>MAK 8:17</a>.
NABRE,41,7,1,"[1] 7:1-23 See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/15/1'>MAT 15:1-20</a>. Against the Pharisees narrow, legalistic, and external practices of piety in matters of purification (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/2'>MAK 7:2-5</a>), external worship (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/6'>MAK 7:6-7</a>), and observance of commandments, Jesus sets in opposition the true moral intent of the divine law (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/8'>MAK 7:8-13</a>). But he goes beyond contrasting the law and Pharisaic interpretation of it. The parable of <a href='/NABRE/41/7/14'>MAK 7:14-15</a> in effect sets aside the law itself in respect to clean and unclean food. He thereby opens the way for unity between Jew and Gentile in the kingdom of God, intimated by Jesus departure for pagan territory beyond Galilee. For similar contrast see <a href='/NABRE/41/2/1'>MAK 2:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/41/3/6'>3:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/3/20'>3:20-35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/6/1'>6:1-6</a>."

NABRE,41,7,5,"[3] Tradition of the elders: the body of detailed, unwritten, human laws regarded by the scribes and Pharisees to have the same binding force as that of the Mosaic law; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/1/14'>GAL 1:14</a>."
NABRE,41,7,11,"[4] Qorban: a formula for a gift to God, dedicating the offering to the temple, so that the giver might continue to use it for himself but not give it to others, even needy parents."
NABRE,41,7,16,"[5] <a href='/NABRE/41/7/16'>MAK 7:16</a>, ""Anyone who has ears to hear ought to hear,"" is omitted because it is lacking in some of the best Greek manuscripts and was probably transferred here by scribes from <a href='/NABRE/41/4/9'>MAK 4:9, 23</a>."
NABRE,41,7,17,"[6] Away from the crowd…the parable: in this context of privacy the term parablerefers to something hidden, about to be revealed to the disciples; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/4/10'>MAK 4:10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/4/34'>34</a>. Jesus sets the Mosaic food laws in the context of the kingdom of God where they are abrogated, and he declares moral defilement the only cause of uncleanness."
NABRE,41,7,19,"[7] (Thus he declared all foods clean): if this bold declaration goes back to Jesus, its force was not realized among Jewish Christians in the early church; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/10/1'>ACT 10:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/44/11/18'>11:18</a>."
NABRE,41,7,24,"[8] 7:24-37 The withdrawal of Jesus to the district of Tyre may have been for a respite (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/24'>MAK 7:24</a>), but he soon moved onward to Sidon and, by way of the Sea of Galilee, to the Decapolis. These districts provided a Gentile setting for the extension of his ministry of healing because the people there acknowledged his power (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/29'>MAK 7:29, 37</a>). The actions attributed to Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/33'>MAK 7:33-35</a>) were also used by healers of the time."
NABRE,41,7,27,"[9] 7:27-28 The figure of a household in which children at table are fed first and then their leftover food is given to the dogs under the table is used effectively to acknowledge the prior claim of the Jews to the ministry of Jesus; however, Jesus accedes to the Gentile womans plea for the cure of her afflicted daughter because of her faith."
NABRE,41,7,36,"[10] The more they proclaimed it: the same verb proclaimattributed here to the crowd in relation to the miracles of Jesus is elsewhere used in Mark for the preaching of the gospel on the part of Jesus, of his disciples, and of the Christian community (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/14'>MAK 1:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/13/10'>13:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/14/9'>14:9</a>).

NABRE,41,8,1,"[1] 8:1-10 The two accounts of the multiplication of loaves and fishes (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/1'>MAK 8:1-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/6/31'>6:31-44</a>) have eucharistic significance. Their similarity of structure and themes but dissimilarity of detail are considered by many to refer to a single event that, however, developed in two distinct traditions, one Jewish Christian and the other Gentile Christian, since Jesus in Marks presentation (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/24'>MAK 7:24-37</a>) has extended his saving mission to the Gentiles."
NABRE,41,8,6,[2] See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/6/41'>MAK 6:41</a>.
NABRE,41,8,11,"[3] 8:11-12 The objection of the Pharisees that Jesus miracles are unsatisfactory for proving the arrival of Gods kingdom is comparable to the request of the crowd for a sign in <a href='/NABRE/43/6/30'>JHN 6:30-31</a>. Jesus response shows that a sign originating in human demand will not be provided; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/14/11'>NUM 14:11, 22</a>."
NABRE,41,8,15,"[4] The leaven of the Pharisees…of Herod: the corruptive action of leaven (<a href='/NABRE/46/5/6'>1CO 5:6-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/5/9'>GAL 5:9</a>) was an apt symbol of the evil dispositions both of the Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/11'>MAK 8:11-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/7/5'>7:5-13</a>) and of Herod (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/14'>MAK 6:14-29</a>) toward Jesus. The disciples of Jesus are warned against sharing such rebellious attitudes toward Jesus; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/8/17'>MAK 8:17, 21</a>."
NABRE,41,8,21,[5] 8:22-26 Jesus actions and the gradual cure of the blind man probably have the same purpose as in the case of the deaf man (<a href='/NABRE/41/7/31'>MAK 7:31-37</a>). Some commentators regard the cure as an intended symbol of the gradual enlightenment of the disciples concerning Jesus messiahship.
NABRE,41,8,27,[6] 8:27-30 This episode is the turning point in Marks account of Jesus in his public ministry. Popular opinions concur in regarding him as a prophet. The disciples by contrast believe him to be the Messiah. Jesus acknowledges this identification but prohibits them from making his messianic office known to avoid confusing it with ambiguous contemporary ideas on the nature of that office. See further the notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/16/13'>MAT 16:13-20</a>.
NABRE,41,8,31,"[7] Son of Man: an enigmatic title. It is used in <a href='/NABRE/27/7/13'>DAN 7:13-14</a> as a symbol of ""the saints of the Most High,"" the faithful Israelites who receive the everlasting kingdom from the Ancient One (God). They are represented by a human figure that contrasts with the various beasts who represent the previous kingdoms of the earth. In the Jewish apocryphal books of 1 Enoch and 4 Ezra the ""Son of Man"" is not, as in Daniel, a group, but a unique figure of extraordinary spiritual endowments, who will be revealed as the one through whom the everlasting kingdom decreed by God will be established. It is possible though doubtful that this individualization of the Son of Man figure had been made in Jesus time, and therefore his use of the title in that sense is questionable. Of itself, this expression means simply a human being, or, indefinitely, someone, and there are evidences of this use in pre-Christian times. Its use in the New Testament is probably due to Jesus speaking of himself in that way, ""a human being,"" and the later churchs taking this in the sense of the Jewish apocrypha and applying it to him with that meaning. Rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the scribes: the supreme council called the Sanhedrin was made up of seventy-one members of these three groups and presided over by the high priest. It exercised authority over the Jews in religious matters. See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/20'>MAT 8:20</a>."
NABRE,41,8,34,"[8] 8:34-35 This utterance of Jesus challenges all believers to authentic discipleship and total commitment to himself through self-renunciation and acceptance of the cross of suffering, even to the sacrifice of life itself. Whoever wishes to save his life will lose it…will save it: an expression of the ambivalence of life and its contrasting destiny. Life seen as mere self-centered earthly existence and lived in denial of Christ ends in destruction, but when lived in loyalty to Christ, despite earthly death, it arrives at fullness of life."
NABRE,41,8,35,"[9] For my sake and that of the gospel: Mark here, as at <a href='/NABRE/41/10/29'>MAK 10:29</a> equates Jesus with the gospel."
NABRE,41,9,1,"[1] There are some standing…come in power: understood by some to refer to the establishment by Gods power of his kingdom on earth in and through the church; more likely, as understood by others, a reference to the imminent parousia."
NABRE,41,9,1,"[2] 9:2-8 Mark and <a href='/NABRE/40/17/1'>MAT 17:1</a> place the transfiguration of Jesus six days after the first prediction of his passion and death and his instruction to the disciples on the doctrine of the cross; <a href='/NABRE/42/9/28'>LUK 9:28</a> has ""about eight days."" Thus the transfiguration counterbalances the prediction of the passion by affording certain of the disciples insight into the divine glory that Jesus possessed. His glory will overcome his death and that of his disciples; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/18'>2CO 3:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/61/1/16'>2PE 1:16-19</a>. The heavenly voice (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/7'>MAK 9:7</a>) prepares the disciples to understand that in the divine plan Jesus must die ignominiously before his messianic glory is made manifest; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/24/25'>LUK 24:25-27</a>. See further the note on <a href='/NABRE/40/17/1'>MAT 17:1-8</a>."
NABRE,41,9,5,"[3] Moses and Elijah represent, respectively, law and prophecy in the Old Testament and are linked to Mount Sinai; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/19/16'>EXO 19:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/20/17'>20:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/11/19/2'>1KG 19:2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/19/8'>8-14</a>. They now appear with Jesus as witnesses to the fulfillment of the law and the prophets taking place in the person of Jesus as he appears in glory."
NABRE,41,9,7,"[4] A cloud came, casting a shadow over them: even the disciples enter into the mystery of his glorification. In the Old Testament the cloud covered the meeting tent, indicating the Lords presence in the midst of his people (<a href='/NABRE/2/40/34'>EXO 40:34-35</a>) and came to rest upon the temple in Jerusalem at the time of its dedication (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/10'>1KG 8:10</a>)."
NABRE,41,9,8,"[5] 9:9-13 At the transfiguration of Jesus his disciples had seen Elijah. They were perplexed because, according to the rabbinical interpretation of <a href='/NABRE/39/3/23'>MAL 3:23-24</a>, Elijah was to come first. Jesus response shows that Elijah has come, in the person of John the Baptist, to prepare for the day of the Lord. Jesus must suffer greatly and be treated with contempt(<a href='/NABRE/41/9/12'>MAK 9:12</a>) like the Baptist (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/13'>MAK 9:13</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/6/17'>MAK 6:17-29</a>."
NABRE,41,9,13,"[6] 9:14-29 The disciples failure to effect a cure seems to reflect unfavorably on Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/14'>MAK 9:14-18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/9/22'>22</a>). In response Jesus exposes their lack of trust in God (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/19'>MAK 9:19</a>) and scores their lack of prayer (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/29'>MAK 9:29</a>), i.e., of conscious reliance on Gods power when acting in Jesus name. For Matthew, see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/17/14'>MAT 17:14-20</a>. <a href='/NABRE/42/9/37'>LUK 9:37-43</a> centers attention on Jesus sovereign power."
NABRE,41,9,29,"[7] This kind can only come out through prayer: a variant reading adds ""and through fasting."""
NABRE,41,9,33,"[8] 9:33-37 Mark probably intends this incident and the sayings that follow as commentary on the disciples lack of understanding (<a href='/NABRE/41/9/32'>MAK 9:32</a>). Their role in Jesus work is one of service, especially to the poor and lowly. Children were the symbol Jesus used for the anawim, the poor in spirit, the lowly in the Christian community."
NABRE,41,9,37,"[9] 9:38-41 Jesus warns against jealousy and intolerance toward others, such as exorcists who do not follow us. The saying in <a href='/NABRE/41/9/40'>MAK 9:40</a> is a broad principle of the divine tolerance. Even the smallest courtesies shown to those who teach in Jesus name do not go unrewarded."

NABRE,41,10,2,"[1] 10:2-9 In the dialogue between Jesus and the Pharisees on the subject of divorce, Jesus declares that the law of Moses permitted divorce (<a href='/NABRE/5/24/1'>DEU 24:1</a>) only because of the hardness of your hearts(<a href='/NABRE/41/10/4'>MAK 10:4-5</a>). In citing <a href='/NABRE/1/1/27'>GEN 1:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/2/24'>2:24</a> Jesus proclaims permanence to be the divine intent from the beginning concerning human marriage (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/6'>MAK 10:6-8</a>). He reaffirms this with the declaration that what God has joined together, no human being must separate(<a href='/NABRE/41/10/9'>MAK 10:9</a>).

NABRE,41,10,23,"[4] 10:23-27 In the Old Testament wealth and material goods are considered a sign of Gods favor (<a href='/NABRE/18/1/10'>JOB 1:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/128/1'>PS 128:1-2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/3/10'>ISA 3:10</a>). The words of Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/41/10/23'>MAK 10:23-25</a> provoke astonishment among the disciples because of their apparent contradiction of the Old Testament concept (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/24'>MAK 10:24, 26</a>). Since wealth, power, and merit generate false security, Jesus rejects them utterly as a claim to enter the kingdom. Achievement of salvation is beyond human capability and depends solely on the goodness of God who offers it as a gift (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/27'>MAK 10:27</a>)."
NABRE,41,10,38,"[5] 10:38-40 Can you drink the cup…I am baptized?: the metaphor of drinking the cup is used in the Old Testament to refer to acceptance of the destiny assigned by God; see note on Psalm <a href='/NABRE/41/11/6'>11:6</a>. In Jesus case, this involves divine judgment on sin that Jesus the innocent one is to expiate on behalf of the guilty (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/24'>MAK 14:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/53/5'>ISA 53:5</a>). His baptism is to be his crucifixion and death for the salvation of the human race; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/12/50'>LUK 12:50</a>.

NABRE,41,13,3,"[2] 13:3-37 Jesus prediction of the destruction of the temple (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/2'>MAK 13:2</a>) provoked questions that the four named disciples put to him in private regarding the time and the sign when all these things are about to come to an end(<a href='/NABRE/41/13/3'>MAK 13:3-4</a>). The response to their questions was Jesus eschatological discourse prior to his imminent death. It contained instruction and consolation exhorting the disciples and the church to faith and obedience through the trials that would confront them (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/5'>MAK 13:5-13</a>). The sign is the presence of the desolating abomination(<a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14</a>; see <a href='/NABRE/27/9/27'>DAN 9:27</a>), i.e., of the Roman power profaning the temple. Flight from Jerusalem is urged rather than defense of the city through misguided messianic hope (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14-23</a>). Intervention will occur only after destruction (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/24'>MAK 13:24-27</a>), which will happen before the end of the first Christian generation (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/28'>MAK 13:28-31</a>). No one but the Father knows the precise time, or that of the parousia (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/32'>MAK 13:32</a>); hence the necessity of constant vigilance (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/33'>MAK 13:33-37</a>).

The Passover commemorated the redemption from slavery and the departure of the Israelites from Egypt by night. It began at sundown after the Passover lamb was sacrificed in the temple in the afternoon of the fourteenth day of the month of Nisan. With the Passover supper on the same evening was associated the eating of unleavened bread. The latter was continued through Nisan 21, a reminder of the affliction of the Israelites and of the haste surrounding their departure. Praise and thanks to God for his goodness in the past were combined at this dual festival with the hope of future salvation.

NABRE,41,16,8,"[2] 16:9-20 This passage, termed the Longer Ending to the Marcan gospel by comparison with a much briefer conclusion found in some less important manuscripts, has traditionally been accepted as a canonical part of the gospel and was defined as such by the Council of Trent. Early citations of it by the Fathers indicate that it was composed by the second century, although vocabulary and style indicate that it was written by someone other than Mark. It is a general resume of the material concerning the appearances of the risen Jesus, reflecting, in particular, traditions found in <a href='/NABRE/42/24/1'>LUK 24</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/20/1'>JHN 20</a>. The Freer Logion: Found after <a href='/NABRE/41/16/14'>MAK 16:14</a> in a fourth-fifth century manuscript preserved in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, DC, this ending was known to Jerome in the fourth century. It reads: ""And they excused themselves, saying, This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan, who does not allow the truth and power of God to prevail over the unclean things dominated by the spirits [or, does not allow the unclean things dominated by the spirits to grasp the truth and power of God]. Therefore reveal your righteousness now. They spoke to Christ. And Christ responded to them, The limit of the years of Satans power is completed, but other terrible things draw near. And for those who sinned I was handed over to death, that they might return to the truth and no longer sin, in order that they might inherit the spiritual and incorruptible heavenly glory of righteousness. But…."""
NABRE,42,1,1,"[1] 1:1-4 The Gospel according to Luke is the only one of the synoptic gospels to begin with a literary prologue. Making use of a formal, literary construction and vocabulary, the author writes the prologue in imitation of Hellenistic Greek writers and, in so doing, relates his story about Jesus to contemporaneous Greek and Roman literature. Luke is not only interested in the words and deeds of Jesus, but also in the larger context of the birth, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus as the fulfillment of the promises of God in the Old Testament. As a second- or third-generation Christian, Luke acknowledges his debt to earlier eyewitnessesand ministers of the word, but claims that his contribution to this developing tradition is a complete and accurate account, told in an orderly manner, and intended to provide Theophilus(""friend of God,"" literally) and other readers with certainty about earlier teachings they have received."
NABRE,42,1,5,"[2] 1:5-2:52 Like the Gospel according to Matthew, this gospel opens with an infancy narrative, a collection of stories about the birth and childhood of Jesus. The narrative uses early Christian traditions about the birth of Jesus, traditions about the birth and circumcision of John the Baptist, and canticles such as the Magnificat (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/46'>LUK 1:46-55</a>) and Benedictus (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/67'>LUK 1:67-79</a>), composed of phrases drawn from the Greek Old Testament. It is largely, however, the composition of Luke who writes in imitation of Old Testament birth stories, combining historical and legendary details, literary ornamentation and interpretation of scripture, to answer in advance the question, ""Who is Jesus Christ?"" The focus of the narrative, therefore, is primarily christological. In this section Luke announces many of the themes that will become prominent in the rest of the gospel: the centrality of Jerusalem and the temple, the journey motif, the universality of salvation, joy and peace, concern for the lowly, the importance of women, the presentation of Jesus as savior, Spirit-guided revelation and prophecy, and the fulfillment of Old Testament promises. The account presents parallel scenes (diptychs) of angelic announcements of the birth of John the Baptist and of Jesus, and of the birth, circumcision, and presentation of John and Jesus. In this parallelism, the ascendency of Jesus over John is stressed: John is prophet of the Most High (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/76'>LUK 1:76</a>); Jesus is Son of the Most High (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/32'>LUK 1:32</a>). John is great in the sight of the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/15'>LUK 1:15</a>); Jesus will be Great (a LXX attribute, used absolutely, of God) (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/32'>LUK 1:32</a>). John will go before the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/16'>LUK 1:16-17</a>); Jesus will be Lord (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/43'>LUK 1:43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>2:11</a>)."
NABRE,42,1,5,"[3] In the days of Herod, King of Judea: Luke relates the story of salvation history to events in contemporary world history.

Herod the Great, the son of the Idumean Antipater, was declared ""King of Judea"" by the Roman Senate in 40 B.C., but became the undisputed ruler of Palestine only in 37 B.C.

NABRE,42,1,19,"[8] I am Gabriel: ""the angel of the Lord"" is identified as Gabriel, the angel who in <a href='/NABRE/27/9/20'>DAN 9:20-25</a> announces the seventy weeks of years and the coming of an anointed one, a prince. By alluding to Old Testament themes in <a href='/NABRE/42/1/17'>LUK 1:17, 19</a> such as the coming of the day of the Lord and the dawning of the messianic era, Luke is presenting his interpretation of the significance of the births of John and Jesus."
NABRE,42,1,20,"[9] You will be speechless and unable to talk: Zechariahs becoming mute is the sign given in response to his question in v 18. When Mary asks a similar question in <a href='/NABRE/42/1/34'>LUK 1:34</a>, unlike Zechariah who was punished for his doubt, she, in spite of her doubt, is praised and reassured (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/35'>LUK 1:35-37</a>)."
NABRE,42,1,25,"[10] 1:26-38 The announcement to Mary of the birth of Jesus is parallel to the announcement to Zechariah of the birth of John. In both the angel Gabriel appears to the parent who is troubled by the vision (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/11'>LUK 1:11-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/1/26'>26-29</a>) and then told by the angel not to fear (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/13'>LUK 1:13, 30</a>). After the announcement is made (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/14'>LUK 1:14-17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/1/31'>31-33</a>) the parent objects (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/18'>LUK 1:18, 34</a>) and a sign is given to confirm the announcement (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/20'>LUK 1:20, 36</a>). The particular focus of the announcement of the birth of Jesus is on his identity as Son of David (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/32'>LUK 1:32-33</a>) and Son of God (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/32'>LUK 1:32, 35</a>)."
NABRE,42,1,32,"[11] Son of the Most High: cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/1/76'>LUK 1:76</a> where John is described as ""prophet of the Most High."" ""Most High"" is a title for God commonly used by Luke (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/35'>LUK 1:35, 76</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/35'>6:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/28'>8:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/7/48'>ACT 7:48</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/16/17'>16:17</a>)."
NABRE,42,1,34,"[12] Marys questioning response is a denial of sexual relations and is used by Luke to lead to the angels declaration about the Spirits role in the conception of this child (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/35'>LUK 1:35</a>). According to Luke, the virginal conception of Jesus takes place through the holy Spirit, the power of God, and therefore Jesus has a unique relationship to Yahweh: he is Son of God."
NABRE,42,1,36,"[13] 1:36-37 The sign given to Mary in confirmation of the angels announcement to her is the pregnancy of her aged relative Elizabeth. If a woman past the childbearing age could become pregnant, why, the angel implies, should there be doubt about Marys pregnancy, for nothing will be impossible for God."
NABRE,42,1,43,"[14] Even before his birth, Jesus is identified in Luke as the Lord."
NABRE,42,1,45,"[15] Blessed are you who believed: Luke portrays Mary as a believer whose faith stands in contrast to the disbelief of Zechariah (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/20'>LUK 1:20</a>). Marys role as believer in the infancy narrative should be seen in connection with the explicit mention of her presence among ""those who believed"" after the resurrection at the beginning of the Acts of the Apostles (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/14'>ACT 1:14</a>)."
NABRE,42,1,46,"[16] 1:46-55 Although Mary is praised for being the mother of the Lord and because of her belief, she reacts as the servant in a psalm of praise, the Magnificat. Because there is no specific connection of the canticle to the context of Marys pregnancy and her visit to Elizabeth, the Magnificat (with the possible exception of v 48) may have been a Jewish Christian hymn that Luke found appropriate at this point in his story. Even if not composed by Luke, it fits in well with themes found elsewhere in Luke: joy and exultation in the Lord; the lowly being singled out for Gods favor; the reversal of human fortunes; the fulfillment of Old Testament promises. The loose connection between the hymn and the context is further seen in the fact that a few Old Latin manuscripts identify the speaker of the hymn as Elizabeth, even though the overwhelming textual evidence makes Mary the speaker."
NABRE,42,1,56,"[17] 1:57-66 The birth and circumcision of John above all emphasize Johns incorporation into the people of Israel by the sign of the covenant (<a href='/NABRE/1/17/1'>GEN 17:1-12</a>). The narrative of Johns circumcision also prepares the way for the subsequent description of the circumcision of Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/42/2/21'>LUK 2:21</a>. At the beginning of his two-volume work Luke shows those who play crucial roles in the inauguration of Christianity to be wholly a part of the people of Israel. At the end of the Acts of the Apostles (<a href='/NABRE/44/21/20'>ACT 21:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/3'>22:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/23/6'>23:6-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/24/14'>24:14-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/26/2'>26:2-8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/26/22'>22-23</a>) he will argue that Christianity is the direct descendant of Pharisaic Judaism."
NABRE,42,1,59,"[18] The practice of Palestinian Judaism at this time was to name the child at birth; moreover, though naming a male child after the father is not completely unknown, the usual practice was to name the child after the grandfather (see <a href='/NABRE/42/1/61'>LUK 1:61</a>). The naming of the child John and Zechariahs recovery from his loss of speech should be understood as fulfilling the angels announcement to Zechariah in <a href='/NABRE/42/1/13'>LUK 1:13, 20</a>."
NABRE,42,1,68,"[19] 1:68-79 Like the canticle of Mary (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/46'>LUK 1:46-55</a>) the canticle of Zechariah is only loosely connected with its context. Apart from <a href='/NABRE/42/1/76'>LUK 1:76-77</a>, the hymn in speaking of a horn for our salvation(<a href='/NABRE/42/1/69'>LUK 1:69</a>) and the daybreak from on high(<a href='/NABRE/42/1/78'>LUK 1:78</a>) applies more closely to Jesus and his work than to John. Again like Marys canticle, it is largely composed of phrases taken from the Greek Old Testament and may have been a Jewish Christian hymn of praise that Luke adapted to fit the present context by inserting <a href='/NABRE/42/1/76'>LUK 1:76-77</a> to give Zechariahs reply to the question asked in <a href='/NABRE/42/1/66'>LUK 1:66</a>."
NABRE,42,1,69,"[20] A horn for our salvation: the horn is a common Old Testament figure for strength (<a href='/NABRE/19/18/3'>PS 18:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/75/5'>75:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/18'>89:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/112/9'>112:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/148/14'>148:14</a>). This description is applied to God in <a href='/NABRE/19/18/3'>PS 18:3</a> and is here transferred to Jesus. The connection of the phrase with the house of Davidgives the title messianic overtones and may indicate an allusion to a phrase in Hannahs song of praise (<a href='/NABRE/9/2/10'>1SM 2:10</a>), ""the horn of his anointed."""
NABRE,42,1,76,[21] You will go before the Lord: here the Lordis most likely a reference to Jesus (contrast <a href='/NABRE/42/1/15'>LUK 1:15-17</a> where Yahweh is meant) and John is presented as the precursor of Jesus.
NABRE,42,1,78,"[22] The daybreak from on high: three times in the LXX (<a href='/NABRE/24/23/5'>JER 23:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/3/8'>ZEC 3:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/6/12'>6:12</a>), the Greek word used here for daybreaktranslates the Hebrew word for ""scion, branch,"" an Old Testament messianic title."
NABRE,42,2,1,"[1] 2:1-2 Although universal registrations of Roman citizens are attested in 28 B.C., 8 B.C., and A.D. 14 and enrollments in individual provinces of those who are not Roman citizens are also attested, such a universal census of the Roman world under Caesar Augustus is unknown outside the New Testament. Moreover, there are notorious historical problems connected with Lukes dating the census when Quirinius was governor of Syria, and the various attempts to resolve the difficulties have proved unsuccessful. P. Sulpicius Quirinius became legate of the province of Syria in A.D. 6-7 when Judea was annexed to the province of Syria. At that time, a provincial census of Judea was taken up. If Quirinius had been legate of Syria previously, it would have to have been before 10 B.C. because the various legates of Syria from 10 B.C. to 4 B.C. (the death of Herod) are known, and such a dating for an earlier census under Quirinius would create additional problems for dating the beginning of Jesus ministry (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/1'>LUK 3:1, 23</a>). A previous legateship after 4 B.C. (and before A.D. 6) would not fit with the dating of Jesus birth in the days of Herod (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/5'>LUK 1:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/2/1'>MAT 2:1</a>). Luke may simply be combining Jesus birth in Bethlehem with his vague recollection of a census under Quirinius (see also <a href='/NABRE/44/5/37'>ACT 5:37</a>) to underline the significance of this birth for the whole Roman world: through this child born in Bethlehem peace and salvation come to the empire."
NABRE,42,2,1,"[2] Caesar Augustus: the reign of the Roman emperor Caesar Augustus is usually dated from 27 B.C. to his death in A.D. 14. According to Greek inscriptions, Augustus was regarded in the Roman Empire as ""savior"" and ""god,"" and he was credited with establishing a time of peace, the pax Augusta, throughout the Roman world during his long reign. It is not by chance that Luke relates the birth of Jesus to the time of Caesar Augustus: the real savior (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>LUK 2:11</a>) and peace-bearer (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/14'>LUK 2:14</a>; see also <a href='/NABRE/42/19/38'>LUK 19:38</a>) is the child born in Bethlehem. The great emperor is simply Gods agent (like the Persian king Cyrus in <a href='/NABRE/23/44/28'>ISA 44:28</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/45/1'>45:1</a>) who provides the occasion for Gods purposes to be accomplished. The whole world: that is, the whole Roman world: Rome, Italy, and the Roman provinces."
NABRE,42,2,7,"[3] Firstborn son: the description of Jesus as firstbornson does not necessarily mean that Mary had other sons. It is a legal description indicating that Jesus possessed the rights and privileges of the firstborn son (<a href='/NABRE/1/27/1'>GEN 27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/13/2'>EXO 13:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/3/12'>NUM 3:12-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/18/15'>18:15-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/21/15'>DEU 21:15-17</a>). See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/1/25'>MAT 1:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/6/3'>MAK 6:3</a>. Wrapped him in swaddling clothes: there may be an allusion here to the birth of another descendant of David, his son Solomon, who though a great king was wrapped in swaddling clothes like any other infant (<a href='/NABRE/70/7/4'>WIS 7:4-6</a>). Laid him in a manger: a feeding trough for animals. A possible allusion to <a href='/NABRE/23/1/3'>ISA 1:3</a> LXX."
NABRE,42,2,8,"[4] 2:8-20 The announcement of Jesus birth to the shepherds is in keeping with Lukes theme that the lowly are singled out as the recipients of Gods favors and blessings (see also <a href='/NABRE/42/1/48'>LUK 1:48, 52</a>)."
NABRE,42,2,11,"[5] The basic message of the infancy narrative is contained in the angels announcement: this child is savior, Messiah, and Lord. Luke is the only synoptic gospel writer to use the title saviorfor Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>LUK 2:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/5/31'>ACT 5:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/23'>13:23</a>; see also <a href='/NABRE/42/1/69'>LUK 1:69</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/19/9'>19:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/4/12'>ACT 4:12</a>). As savior, Jesus is looked upon by Luke as the one who rescues humanity from sin and delivers humanity from the condition of alienation from God. The title christos, ""Christ,"" is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew māšîaḥ, ""Messiah,"" ""anointed one."" Among certain groups in first-century Palestinian Judaism, the title was applied to an expected royal leader from the line of David who would restore the kingdom to Israel (see <a href='/NABRE/44/1/6'>ACT 1:6</a>). The political overtones of the title are played down in Luke and instead the Messiah of the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/26'>LUK 2:26</a>) or the Lords anointed is the one who now brings salvation to all humanity, Jew and Gentile (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/29'>LUK 2:29-32</a>). Lord is the most frequently used title for Jesus in Luke and Acts. In the New Testament it is also applied to Yahweh, as it is in the Old Testament. When used of Jesus it points to his transcendence and dominion over humanity."
NABRE,42,2,14,"[6] On earth peace to those on whom his favor rests: the peace that results from the Christ event is for those whom God has favored with his grace. This reading is found in the oldest representatives of the Western and Alexandrian text traditions and is the preferred one; the Byzantine text tradition, on the other hand, reads: ""on earth peace, good will toward men."" The peace of which Lukes gospel speaks (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/14'>LUK 2:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/50'>7:50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/48'>8:48</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/10/5'>10:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/19/38'>19:38, 42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/36'>24:36</a>) is more than the absence of war of the pax Augusta; it also includes the security and well-being characteristic of peace in the Old Testament."
NABRE,42,2,21,"[7] Just as John before him had been incorporated into the people of Israel through his circumcision, so too this child (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/1/57'>LUK 1:57-66</a>)."
NABRE,42,2,22,"[8] 2:22-40 The presentation of Jesus in the temple depicts the parents of Jesus as devout Jews, faithful observers of the law of the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/23'>LUK 2:23-24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/2/39'>39</a>), i.e., the law of Moses. In this respect, they are described in a fashion similar to the parents of John (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/6'>LUK 1:6</a>) and Simeon (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/25'>LUK 2:25</a>) and Anna (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/36'>LUK 2:36-37</a>)."
NABRE,42,2,22,"[9] Their purification: syntactically, theirmust refer to Mary and Joseph, even though the Mosaic law never mentions the purification of the husband. Recognizing the problem, some Western scribes have altered the text to read ""his purification,"" understanding the presentation of Jesus in the temple as a form of purification; the Vulgate version has a Latin form that could be either ""his"" or ""her."" According to the Mosaic law (<a href='/NABRE/3/12/2'>LEV 12:2-8</a>), the woman who gives birth to a boy is unable for forty days to touch anything sacred or to enter the temple area by reason of her legal impurity. At the end of this period she is required to offer a year-old lamb as a burnt offering and a turtledove or young pigeon as an expiation of sin. The woman who could not afford a lamb offered instead two turtledoves or two young pigeons, as Mary does here. They took him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord: as the firstborn son (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/7'>LUK 2:7</a>) Jesus was consecrated to the Lord as the law required (<a href='/NABRE/2/13/2'>EXO 13:2, 12</a>), but there was no requirement that this be done at the temple. The concept of a presentation at the temple is probably derived from <a href='/NABRE/9/1/24'>1SM 1:24-28</a>, where Hannah offers the child Samuel for sanctuary services. The law further stipulated (<a href='/NABRE/4/3/47'>NUM 3:47-48</a>) that the firstborn son should be redeemed by the parents through their payment of five shekels to a member of a priestly family. About this legal requirement Luke is silent."
NABRE,42,2,25,[10] Awaiting the consolation of Israel: Simeon here and later Anna who speak about the child to all who were awaiting the redemption of Jerusalem represent the hopes and expectations of faithful and devout Jews who at this time were looking forward to the restoration of Gods rule in Israel. The birth of Jesus brings these hopes to fulfillment.
NABRE,42,2,35,"[11] (And you yourself a sword will pierce): Mary herself will not be untouched by the various reactions to the role of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/34'>LUK 2:34</a>). Her blessedness as mother of the Lord will be challenged by her son who describes true blessedness as ""hearing the word of God and observing it"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/27'>LUK 11:27-28</a> and <a href='/NABRE/42/8/20'>LUK 8:20-21</a>)."
NABRE,42,2,40,"[12] 2:41-52 This storys concern with an incident from Jesus youth is unique in the canonical gospel tradition. It presents Jesus in the role of the faithful Jewish boy, raised in the traditions of Israel, and fulfilling all that the law requires. With this episode, the infancy narrative ends just as it began, in the setting of the Jerusalem temple."
NABRE,42,2,49,"[13] I must be in my Fathers house: this phrase can also be translated, ""I must be about my Fathers work."" In either translation, Jesus refers to God as his Father. His divine sonship, and his obedience to his heavenly Fathers will, take precedence over his ties to his family."
NABRE,42,3,1,"[1] 3:1-20 Although Luke is indebted in this section to his sources, the Gospel of Mark and a collection of sayings of John the Baptist, he has clearly marked this introduction to the ministry of Jesus with his own individual style. Just as the gospel began with a long periodic sentence (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/1'>LUK 1:1-4</a>), so too this section (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/1'>LUK 3:1-2</a>). He casts the call of John the Baptist in the form of an Old Testament prophetic call (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/2'>LUK 3:2</a>) and extends the quotation from Isaiah found in <a href='/NABRE/41/1/3'>MAK 1:3</a> (<a href='/NABRE/23/40/3'>ISA 40:3</a>) by the addition of <a href='/NABRE/23/40/4'>ISA 40:4-5</a> in <a href='/NABRE/42/3/5'>LUK 3:5-6</a>. In doing so, he presents his theme of the universality of salvation, which he has announced earlier in the words of Simeon (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/30'>LUK 2:30-32</a>). Moreover, in describing the expectation of the people (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/15'>LUK 3:15</a>), Luke is characterizing the time of Johns preaching in the same way as he had earlier described the situation of other devout Israelites in the infancy narrative (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/25'>LUK 2:25-26</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/2/37'>37-38</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/42/3/7'>LUK 3:7-18</a> Luke presents the preaching of John the Baptist who urges the crowds to reform in view of the coming wrath(<a href='/NABRE/42/3/7'>LUK 3:7, 9</a>: eschatological preaching), and who offers the crowds certain standards for reforming social conduct (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/10'>LUK 3:10-14</a>: ethical preaching), and who announces to the crowds the coming of one mightier thanhe (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/15'>LUK 3:15-18</a>: messianic preaching)."
NABRE,42,3,1,"[2] Tiberius Caesar: Tiberius succeeded Augustus as emperor in A.D. 14 and reigned until A.D. 37. The fifteenth year of his reign, depending on the method of calculating his first regnal year, would have fallen between A.D. 27 and 29. Pontius Pilate: prefect of Judea from A.D. 26 to 36. The Jewish historian Josephus describes him as a greedy and ruthless prefect who had little regard for the local Jewish population and their religious practices (see <a href='/NABRE/42/13/1'>LUK 13:1</a>). Herod: i.e., Herod Antipas, the son of Herod the Great. He ruled over Galilee and Perea from 4 B.C. to A.D. 39. His official title tetrarchmeans literally, ""ruler of a quarter,"" but came to designate any subordinate prince. Philip: also a son of Herod the Great, tetrarch of the territory to the north and east of the Sea of Galilee from 4 B.C. to A.D. 34. Only two small areas of this territory are mentioned by Luke. Lysanias: nothing is known about this Lysanias who is said here to have been tetrarch of Abilene, a territory northwest of Damascus."
NABRE,42,3,2,"[3] During the high priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas: after situating the call of John the Baptist in terms of the civil rulers of the period, Luke now mentions the religious leadership of Palestine (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/1/5'>LUK 1:5</a>). Annas had been high priest A.D. 6-15. After being deposed by the Romans in A.D. 15 he was succeeded by various members of his family and eventually by his son-in-law, Caiaphas, who was high priest A.D. 18-36. Luke refers to Annas as high priest at this time (but see <a href='/NABRE/43/18/13'>JHN 18:13, 19</a>), possibly because of the continuing influence of Annas or because the title continued to be used for the ex-high priest. The word of God came to John: Luke is alone among the New Testament writers in associating the preaching of John with a call from God. Luke is thereby identifying John with the prophets whose ministries began with similar calls. In <a href='/NABRE/42/7/26'>LUK 7:26</a> John will be described as ""more than a prophet""; he is also the precursor of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/27'>LUK 7:27</a>), a transitional figure inaugurating the period of the fulfillment of prophecy and promise."

NABRE,42,3,16,"[6] He will baptize you with the holy Spirit and fire: in contrast to Johns baptism with water, Jesus is said to baptize with the holy Spirit and with fire. From the point of view of the early Christian community, the Spirit and fire must have been understood in the light of the fire symbolism of the pouring out of the Spirit at Pentecost (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/1'>ACT 2:1-4</a>); but as part of Johns preaching, the Spirit and fire should be related to their purifying and refining characteristics (<a href='/NABRE/26/36/25'>EZE 36:25-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/39/3/2'>MAL 3:2-3</a>).

NABRE,42,3,19,"[8] 3:19-20 Luke separates the ministry of John the Baptist from that of Jesus by reporting the imprisonment of John before the baptism of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/21'>LUK 3:21-22</a>). Luke uses this literary device to serve his understanding of the periods of salvation history. With John the Baptist, the time of promise, the period of Israel, comes to an end; with the baptism of Jesus and the descent of the Spirit upon him, the time of fulfillment, the period of Jesus, begins. In his second volume, the Acts of the Apostles, Luke will introduce the third epoch in salvation history, the period of the church."
NABRE,42,3,20,"[9] 3:21-22 This episode in Luke focuses on the heavenly message identifying Jesus as Son and, through the allusion to <a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>ISA 42:1</a>, as Servant of Yahweh. The relationship of Jesus to the Father has already been announced in the infancy narrative (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/32'>LUK 1:32, 35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/2/49'>2:49</a>); it occurs here at the beginning of Jesus Galilean ministry and will reappear in <a href='/NABRE/42/9/35'>LUK 9:35</a> before another major section of Lukes gospel, the travel narrative (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/51'>LUK 9:51</a>-<a href='/NABRE/42/19/27'>19:27</a>). Elsewhere in Lukes writings (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/18'>LUK 4:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/10/38'>ACT 10:38</a>), this incident will be interpreted as a type of anointing of Jesus."
NABRE,42,3,21,[10] Was praying: Luke regularly presents Jesus at prayer at important points in his ministry: here at his baptism; at the choice of the Twelve (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/12'>LUK 6:12</a>); before Peters confession (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/18'>LUK 9:18</a>); at the transfiguration (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/28'>LUK 9:28</a>); when he teaches his disciples to pray (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/1'>LUK 11:1</a>); at the Last Supper (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/32'>LUK 22:32</a>); on the Mount of Olives (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/41'>LUK 22:41</a>); on the cross (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/46'>LUK 23:46</a>).
NABRE,42,3,22,"[11] You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased: this is the best attested reading in the Greek manuscripts. The Western reading, ""You are my Son, this day I have begotten you,"" is derived from <a href='/NABRE/19/2/7'>PS 2:7</a>."
NABRE,42,3,22,"[12] 3:23-38 Whereas <a href='/NABRE/40/1/2'>MAT 1:2</a> begins the genealogy of Jesus with Abraham to emphasize Jesus bonds with the people of Israel, Lukes universalism leads him to trace the descent of Jesus beyond Israel to Adam and beyond that to God (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/38'>LUK 3:38</a>) to stress again Jesus divine sonship."
NABRE,42,3,31,"[13] The son of Nathan, the son of David: in keeping with Jesus prophetic role in Luke and Acts (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/42/7/16'>LUK 7:16, 39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/9/8'>9:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/13/33'>13:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/19'>24:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/22'>ACT 3:22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/7/37'>7:37</a>) Luke traces Jesus Davidic ancestry through the prophet Nathan (see <a href='/NABRE/10/7/2'>2SM 7:2</a>) rather than through King Solomon, as <a href='/NABRE/40/1/6'>MAT 1:6-7</a>."
NABRE,42,4,1,[1] 4:1-13 See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/4/1'>MAT 4:1-11</a>.
NABRE,42,4,1,"[2] Filled with the holy Spirit: as a result of the descent of the Spirit upon him at his baptism (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/21'>LUK 3:21-22</a>), Jesus is now equipped to overcome the devil. Just as the Spirit is prominent at this early stage of Jesus ministry (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/1'>LUK 4:1, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/4/18'>18</a>), so too it will be at the beginning of the period of the church in Acts (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/4'>ACT 1:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/2/4'>2:4, 17</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,2,[3] For forty days: the mention of forty days recalls the forty years of the wilderness wanderings of the Israelites during the Exodus (<a href='/NABRE/5/8/2'>DEU 8:2</a>).
NABRE,42,4,9,"[4] To Jerusalem: the Lucan order of the temptations concludes on the parapet of the temple in Jerusalem, the city of destiny in Luke-Acts. It is in Jerusalem that Jesus will ultimately face his destiny (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/51'>LUK 9:51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/13/33'>13:33</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,13,"[5] For a time: the devils opportune time will occur before the passion and death of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/3'>LUK 22:3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/22/31'>31-32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/22/53'>53</a>)."

NABRE,42,4,15,"[7] 4:16-30 Luke has transposed to the beginning of Jesus ministry an incident from his Marcan source, which situated it near the end of the Galilean ministry (<a href='/NABRE/41/6/1'>MAK 6:1-6</a>a). In doing so, Luke turns the initial admiration (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/22'>LUK 4:22</a>) and subsequent rejection of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/28'>LUK 4:28-29</a>) into a foreshadowing of the whole future ministry of Jesus. Moreover, the rejection of Jesus in his own hometown hints at the greater rejection of him by Israel (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/46'>ACT 13:46</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,16,[8] According to his custom: Jesus practice of regularly attending synagogue is carried on by the early Christians practice of meeting in the temple (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/46'>ACT 2:46</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/1'>3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/5/12'>5:12</a>).
NABRE,42,4,18,"[9] The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me: see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/3/21'>LUK 3:21-22</a>. As this incident develops, Jesus is portrayed as a prophet whose ministry is compared to that of the prophets Elijah and Elisha. Prophetic anointings are known in first-century Palestinian Judaism from the Qumran literature that speaks of prophets as Gods anointed ones. To bring glad tidings to the poor: more than any other gospel writer Luke is concerned with Jesus attitude toward the economically and socially poor (see <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20, 24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/16'>12:16-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/14/12'>14:12-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/19'>16:19-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/19/8'>19:8</a>). At times, the poor in Lukes gospel are associated with the downtrodden, the oppressed and afflicted, the forgotten and the neglected (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/18'>LUK 4:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>6:20-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/22'>7:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/14/12'>14:12-14</a>), and it is they who accept Jesus message of salvation."
NABRE,42,4,21,"[10] Today this scripture passage is fulfilled in your hearing: this sermon inaugurates the time of fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. Luke presents the ministry of Jesus as fulfilling Old Testament hopes and expectations (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/22'>LUK 7:22</a>); for Luke, even Jesus suffering, death, and resurrection are done in fulfillment of the scriptures (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/25'>LUK 24:25-27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/24/44'>44-46</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/18'>ACT 3:18</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,23,"[11] The things that we heard were done in Capernaum: Lukes source for this incident reveals an awareness of an earlier ministry of Jesus in Capernaum that Luke has not yet made use of because of his transposition of this Nazareth episode to the beginning of Jesus Galilean ministry. It is possible that by use of the future tense you will quote me…, Jesus is being portrayed as a prophet."
NABRE,42,4,25,[12] 4:25-26 The references to Elijah and Elisha serve several purposes in this episode: they emphasize Lukes portrait of Jesus as a prophet like Elijah and Elisha; they help to explain why the initial admiration of the people turns to rejection; and they provide the scriptural justification for the future Christian mission to the Gentiles.
NABRE,42,4,26,"[13] A widow in Zarephath in the land of Sidon: like Naaman the Syrian in <a href='/NABRE/42/4/27'>LUK 4:27</a>, a non-Israelite becomes the object of the prophets ministry."
NABRE,42,4,31,"[14] 4:31-44 The next several incidents in Jesus ministry take place in Capernaum and are based on Lukes source, <a href='/NABRE/41/1/21'>MAK 1:21-39</a>. To the previous portrait of Jesus as prophet (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/16'>LUK 4:16-30</a>) they now add a presentation of him as teacher (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/31'>LUK 4:31-32</a>), exorcist (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/32'>LUK 4:32-37</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/4/41'>41</a>), healer (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/38'>LUK 4:38-40</a>), and proclaimer of Gods kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/43'>LUK 4:43</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,34,"[15] What have you to do with us?: see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/2/4'>JHN 2:4</a>. Have you come to destroy us?: the question reflects the current belief that before the day of the Lord control over humanity would be wrested from the evil spirits, evil destroyed, and Gods authority over humanity reestablished. The synoptic gospel tradition presents Jesus carrying out this task."
NABRE,42,4,38,"[16] The house of Simon: because of Lukes arrangement of material, the reader has not yet been introduced to Simon (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/1/16'>MAK 1:16-18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/1/29'>29-31</a>). Situated as it is before the call of Simon (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/1'>LUK 5:1-11</a>), it helps the reader to understand Simons eagerness to do what Jesus says (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/5'>LUK 5:5</a>) and to follow him (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/11'>LUK 5:11</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,41,"[17] They knew that he was the Messiah: that is, the Christ (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>LUK 2:11</a>)."
NABRE,42,4,42,[18] They tried to prevent him from leaving them: the reaction of these strangers in Capernaum is presented in contrast to the reactions of those in his hometown who rejected him (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/28'>LUK 4:28-30</a>).
NABRE,42,4,44,"[19] In the synagogues of Judea: instead of Judea, which is the best reading of the manuscript tradition, the Byzantine text tradition and other manuscripts read ""Galilee,"" a reading that harmonizes Luke with <a href='/NABRE/40/4/23'>MAT 4:23</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/1/39'>MAK 1:39</a>. Up to this point Luke has spoken only of a ministry of Jesus in Galilee. Luke may be using Judeato refer to the land of Israel, the territory of the Jews, and not to a specific portion of it."
NABRE,42,5,1,"[1] This incident has been transposed from his source, <a href='/NABRE/41/1/16'>MAK 1:16-20</a>, which places it immediately after Jesus makes his appearance in Galilee. By this transposition Luke uses this example of Simon’s acceptance of Jesus to counter the earlier rejection of him by his hometown people, and since several incidents dealing with Jesus’ power and authority have already been narrated, Luke creates a plausible context for the acceptance of Jesus by Simon and his partners. Many commentators have noted the similarity between the wondrous catch of fish reported here (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/4'>LUK 4:4-9</a>) and the post-resurrectional appearance of Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/43/21/1'>JHN 21:1-11</a>. There are traces in Luke’s story that the post-resurrectional context is the original one: in <a href='/NABRE/42/4/8'>LUK 4:8</a> Simon addresses Jesus as Lord (a post-resurrectional title for Jesus—see <a href='/NABRE/42/24/34'>LUK 24:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/2/36'>ACT 2:36</a>—that has been read back into the historical ministry of Jesus) and recognizes himself as a sinner (an appropriate recognition for one who has denied knowing Jesus—<a href='/NABRE/42/22/54'>LUK 22:54-62</a>). As used by Luke, the incident looks forward to Peter’s leadership in Luke-Acts (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/14'>LUK 6:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/9/20'>9:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/22/31'>22:31-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/34'>24:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/1/15'>ACT 1:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/2/14'>2:14-40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/10/11'>10:11-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/15/7'>15:7-12</a>) and symbolizes the future success of Peter as fisherman (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/41'>ACT 2:41</a>)."
NABRE,42,5,11,"[2] They left everything: in <a href='/NABRE/41/1/16'>MAK 1:16-20</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/4/18'>MAT 4:18-22</a> the fishermen who follow Jesus leave their nets and their father; in Luke, they leave everything(see also <a href='/NABRE/42/5/28'>LUK 5:28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/33'>12:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/14/33'>14:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/18/22'>18:22</a>), an indication of Lukes theme of complete detachment from material possessions."

NABRE,42,5,17,"[5] 5:17-6:11 From his Marcan source, Luke now introduces a series of controversies with Pharisees: controversy over Jesus power to forgive sins (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/17'>LUK 5:17-26</a>); controversy over his eating and drinking with tax collectors and sinners (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/27'>LUK 5:27-32</a>); controversy over not fasting (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/33'>LUK 5:33-36</a>); and finally two episodes narrating controversies over observance of the sabbath (<a href='/NABRE/42/5/1'>LUK 5:1-11</a>)."

NABRE,42,5,20,"[8] As for you, your sins are forgiven: literally, ""O man, your sins are forgiven you.""

NABRE,42,6,1,"[1] 6:1-11 The two episodes recounted here deal with gathering grain and healing, both of which were forbidden on the sabbath. In his defense of his disciples conduct and his own charitable deed, Jesus argues that satisfying human needs such as hunger and performing works of mercy take precedence even over the sacred sabbath rest.

NABRE,42,6,13,"[5] He chose Twelve: the identification of this group as the Twelveis a part of early Christian tradition (see <a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>1CO 15:5</a>), and in Matthew and Luke, the Twelveare associated with the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/29'>LUK 22:29-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/19/28'>MAT 19:28</a>). After the fall of Judas from his position among the Twelve, the need is felt on the part of the early community to reconstitute this group before the Christian mission begins at Pentecost (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/15'>ACT 1:15-26</a>). From Lukes perspective, they are an important group who because of their association with Jesus from the time of his baptism to his ascension (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/21'>ACT 1:21-22</a>) provide the continuity between the historical Jesus and the church of Lukes day and who as the original eyewitnesses guarantee the fidelity of the churchs beliefs and practices to the teachings of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/1'>LUK 1:1-4</a>). Whom he also named apostles: only Luke among the gospel writers attributes to Jesus the bestowal of the name apostlesupon the Twelve. See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/10/2'>MAT 10:2-4</a>. ""Apostle"" becomes a technical term in early Christianity for a missionary sent out to preach the word of God. Although Luke seems to want to restrict the title to the Twelve (only in <a href='/NABRE/44/4/4'>ACT 4:4, 14</a> are Paul and Barnabas termed apostles), other places in the New Testament show an awareness that the term was more widely applied (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>1CO 15:5-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/1/19'>GAL 1:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/1/1'>1CO 1:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/1'>9:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/16/7'>ROM 16:7</a>)."

NABRE,42,6,20,"[10] 6:20-49 Lukes ""Sermon on the Plain"" is the counterpart to Matthews ""Sermon on the Mount"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/1'>MAT 5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/40/7/27'>7:27</a>). It is addressed to the disciples of Jesus, and, like the sermon in Matthew, it begins with beatitudes (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-22</a>) and ends with the parable of the two houses (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/46'>LUK 6:46-49</a>). Almost all the words of Jesus reported by Luke are found in Matthews version, but because Matthew includes sayings that were related to specifically Jewish Christian problems (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/40/5/17'>MAT 5:17-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/6/1'>6:1-8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/6/16'>16-18</a>) that Luke did not find appropriate for his predominantly Gentile Christian audience, the ""Sermon on the Mount"" is considerably longer. Lukes sermon may be outlined as follows: an introduction consisting of blessings and woes (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-26</a>); the love of ones enemies (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/27'>LUK 6:27-36</a>); the demands of loving ones neighbor (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/37'>LUK 6:37-42</a>); good deeds as proof of ones goodness (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/43'>LUK 6:43-45</a>); a parable illustrating the result of listening to and acting on the words of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/46'>LUK 6:46-49</a>). At the core of the sermon is Jesus teaching on the love of ones enemies (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/27'>LUK 6:27-36</a>) that has as its source of motivation Gods graciousness and compassion for all humanity (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/35'>LUK 6:35-36</a>) and Jesus teaching on the love of ones neighbor (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/37'>LUK 6:37-42</a>) that is characterized by forgiveness and generosity."
NABRE,42,6,20,"[11] 6:20-26 The introductory portion of the sermon consists of blessings and woes that address the real economic and social conditions of humanity (the poor—the rich; the hungry—the satisfied; those grieving—those laughing; the outcast—the socially acceptable). By contrast, Matthew emphasizes the religious and spiritual values of disciples in the kingdom inaugurated by Jesus (""poor in spirit,"" <a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3</a>; ""hunger and thirst for righteousness,"" <a href='/NABRE/40/5/6'>MAT 5:6</a>). In the sermon, blessedextols the fortunate condition of persons who are favored with the blessings of God; the woes, addressed as they are to the disciples of Jesus, threaten Gods profound displeasure on those so blinded by their present fortunate situation that they do not recognize and appreciate the real values of Gods kingdom. In all the blessings and woes, the present condition of the persons addressed will be reversed in the future."

NABRE,42,7,1,[1] 7:1-8:3 The episodes in this section present a series of reactions to the Galilean ministry of Jesus and reflect some of Lukes particular interests: the faith of a Gentile (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/1'>LUK 7:1-10</a>); the prophet Jesus concern for a widowed mother (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/11'>LUK 7:11-17</a>); the ministry of Jesus directed to the afflicted and unfortunate of <a href='/NABRE/23/61/1'>ISA 61:1</a> (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/18'>LUK 7:18-23</a>); the relation between John and Jesus and their role in Gods plan for salvation (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/24'>LUK 7:24-35</a>); a forgiven sinners manifestation of love (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/36'>LUK 7:36-50</a>); the association of women with the ministry of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/1'>LUK 8:1-3</a>).
NABRE,42,7,1,"[2] 7:1-10 This story about the faith of the centurion, a Gentile who cherishes the Jewish nation (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/5'>LUK 7:5</a>), prepares for the story in Acts of the conversion by Peter of the Roman centurion Cornelius who is similarly described as one who is generous to the Jewish nation (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/2'>ACT 10:2</a>). See also <a href='/NABRE/44/10/34'>ACT 10:34-35</a> in the speech of Peter: ""God shows no partiality…whoever fears him and acts righteously is acceptable to him."" See also notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/5'>MAT 8:5-13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/4/43'>JHN 4:43-54</a>."
NABRE,42,7,2,[3] A centurion: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/5'>MAT 8:5</a>.
NABRE,42,7,6,[4] I am not worthy to have you enter under my roof: to enter the house of a Gentile was considered unclean for a Jew; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/10/28'>ACT 10:28</a>.
NABRE,42,7,10,"[5] 7:11-17 In the previous incident Jesus power was displayed for a Gentile whose servant was dying; in this episode it is displayed toward a widowed mother whose only son has already died. Jesus power over death prepares for his reply to Johns disciples in <a href='/NABRE/42/7/22'>LUK 7:22</a>: ""the dead are raised."" This resuscitation in alluding to the prophet Elijahs resurrection of the only son of a widow of Zarephath (<a href='/NABRE/11/7/8'>1KG 7:8-24</a>) leads to the reaction of the crowd: ""A great prophet has arisen in our midst"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/16'>LUK 7:16</a>)."
NABRE,42,7,17,"[6] 7:18-23 In answer to Johns question, Are you the one who is to come?—a probable reference to the return of the fiery prophet of reform, Elijah, ""before the day of the Lord comes, the great and terrible day"" (<a href='/NABRE/39/3/23'>MAL 3:23</a>)—Jesus responds that his role is rather to bring the blessings spoken of in <a href='/NABRE/23/61/1'>ISA 61:1</a> to the oppressed and neglected of society (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/22'>LUK 7:22</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/4/18'>LUK 4:18</a>)."
NABRE,42,7,23,"[7] Blessed is the one who takes no offense at me: this beatitude is pronounced on the person who recognizes Jesus true identity in spite of previous expectations of what ""the one who is to come"" would be like."
NABRE,42,7,24,"[8] 7:24-30 In his testimony to John, Jesus reveals his understanding of the relationship between them: John is the precursor of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/27'>LUK 7:27</a>); John is the messenger spoken of in <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1</a> who in <a href='/NABRE/39/3/23'>MAL 3:23</a> is identified as Elijah. Taken with the previous episode, it can be seen that Jesus identifies John as precisely the person John envisioned Jesus to be: the Elijah who prepares the way for the coming of the day of the Lord."
NABRE,42,7,31,[9] 7:31-35 See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/11/16'>MAT 11:16-19</a>.
NABRE,42,7,35,"[10] 7:36-50 In this story of the pardoning of the sinful woman Luke presents two different reactions to the ministry of Jesus. A Pharisee, suspecting Jesus to be a prophet, invites Jesus to a festive banquet in his house, but the Pharisees self-righteousness leads to little forgiveness by God and consequently little love shown toward Jesus. The sinful woman, on the other hand, manifests a faith in God (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/50'>LUK 7:50</a>) that has led her to seek forgiveness for her sins, and because so much was forgiven, she now overwhelms Jesus with her display of love; cf. the similar contrast in attitudes in <a href='/NABRE/42/18/9'>LUK 18:9-14</a>. The whole episode is a powerful lesson on the relation between forgiveness and love."
NABRE,42,7,36,"[11] Reclined at table: the normal posture of guests at a banquet. Other oriental banquet customs alluded to in this story include the reception by the host with a kiss (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/45'>LUK 7:45</a>), washing the feet of the guests (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/44'>LUK 7:44</a>), and the anointing of the guests heads (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/46'>LUK 7:46</a>)."
NABRE,42,7,41,[12] Days wages: one denarius is the normal daily wage of a laborer.
NABRE,42,7,47,"[13] Her many sins have been forgiven; hence, she has shown great love: literally, ""her many sins have been forgiven, seeing that she has loved much."" That the womans sins have been forgiven is attested by the great love she shows toward Jesus. Her love is the consequence of her forgiveness. This is also the meaning demanded by the parable in <a href='/NABRE/42/7/41'>LUK 7:41-43</a>."
NABRE,42,8,1,"[1] 8:1-3 Luke presents Jesus as an itinerant preacher traveling in the company of the Twelve and of the Galilean women who are sustaining them out of their means. These Galilean women will later accompany Jesus on his journey to Jerusalem and become witnesses to his death (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/49'>LUK 23:49</a>) and resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/9'>LUK 24:9-11</a>, where Mary Magdalene and Joanna are specifically mentioned; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/44/1/14'>ACT 1:14</a>). The association of women with the ministry of Jesus is most unusual in the light of the attitude of first-century Palestinian Judaism toward women. The more common attitude is expressed in <a href='/NABRE/43/4/27'>JHN 4:27</a>, and early rabbinic documents caution against speaking with women in public."
NABRE,42,8,4,"[2] 8:4-21 The focus in this section is on how one should hear the word of God and act on it. It includes the parable of the sower and its explanation (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/4'>LUK 8:4-15</a>), a collection of sayings on how one should act on the word that is heard (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/16'>LUK 8:16-18</a>), and the identification of the mother and brothers of Jesus as the ones who hear the word and act on it (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/19'>LUK 8:19-21</a>). See also notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/13/1'>MAT 13:1-53</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/4/1'>MAK 4:1-34</a>."

NABRE,42,8,15,[5] 8:16-18 These sayings continue the theme of responding to the word of God. Those who hear the word must become a light to others (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/16'>LUK 8:16</a>); even the mysteries of the kingdom that have been made known to the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/9'>LUK 8:9-10</a>) must come to light (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/17'>LUK 8:17</a>); a generous and persevering response to the word of God leads to a still more perfect response to the word.
NABRE,42,8,19,[6] His brothers: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/6/3'>MAK 6:3</a>.
NABRE,42,8,21,"[7] The family of Jesus is not constituted by physical relationship with him but by obedience to the word of God. In this, Luke agrees with the Marcan parallel (<a href='/NABRE/41/3/31'>MAK 3:31-35</a>), although by omitting <a href='/NABRE/41/3/33'>MAK 3:33</a> and especially <a href='/NABRE/41/3/20'>MAK 3:20-21</a> Luke has softened the Marcan picture of Jesus natural family. Probably he did this because Mary has already been presented in <a href='/NABRE/42/1/38'>LUK 1:38</a> as the obedient handmaid of the Lord who fulfills the requirement for belonging to the eschatological family of Jesus; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/42/11/27'>LUK 11:27-28</a>."
NABRE,42,8,22,[8] 8:22-56 This section records four miracles of Jesus that manifest his power and authority: (1) the calming of a storm on the lake (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/22'>LUK 8:22-25</a>); (2) the exorcism of a demoniac (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/26'>LUK 8:26-39</a>); (3) the cure of a hemorrhaging woman (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/40'>LUK 8:40-48</a>); (4) the raising of Jairuss daughter to life (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/49'>LUK 8:49-56</a>). They parallel the same sequence of stories at <a href='/NABRE/41/4/35'>MAK 4:35</a>-<a href='/NABRE/41/5/43'>5:43</a>.
NABRE,42,8,26,[9] Gerasenes: other manuscripts read Gadarenes or Gergesenes. See also note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/28'>MAT 8:28</a>. Opposite Galilee: probably Gentile territory (note the presence in the area of pigs—unclean animals to Jews) and an indication that the person who receives salvation (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/36'>LUK 8:36</a>) is a Gentile.
NABRE,42,8,30,"[10] What is your name?: the question reflects the popular belief that knowledge of the spirits name brought control over the spirit. Legion: to Jesus question the demon replies with a Latin word transliterated into Greek. The Roman legion at this period consisted of 5,000 to 6,000 foot soldiers; hence the name implies a very large number of demons."
NABRE,42,8,31,"[11] Abyss: the place of the dead (<a href='/NABRE/45/10/7'>ROM 10:7</a>) or the prison of Satan (<a href='/NABRE/66/20/3'>REV 20:3</a>) or the subterranean ""watery deep"" that symbolizes the chaos before the order imposed by creation (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/2'>GEN 1:2</a>)."

NABRE,42,8,39,"[13] 8:40-56 Two interwoven miracle stories, one a healing and the other a resuscitation, present Jesus as master over sickness and death. In the Lucan account, faith in Jesus is responsible for the cure (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/48'>LUK 8:48</a>) and for the raising to life (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/50'>LUK 8:50</a>)."
NABRE,42,8,42,"[14] An only daughter: cf. the son of the widow of Nain whom Luke describes as an ""only"" son (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/12'>LUK 7:12</a>; see also <a href='/NABRE/42/9/38'>LUK 9:38</a>)."
NABRE,42,8,43,[15] Afflicted with hemorrhages for twelve years: according to the Mosaic law (<a href='/NABRE/3/15/25'>LEV 15:25-30</a>) this condition would render the woman unclean and unfit for contact with other people.

NABRE,42,9,1,"[1] 9:1-6 Armed with the power and authority that Jesus himself has been displaying in the previous episodes, the Twelve are now sent out to continue the work that Jesus has been performing throughout his Galilean ministry: (1) proclaiming the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/43'>LUK 4:43</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/1'>8:1</a>); (2) exorcising demons (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/33'>LUK 4:33-37</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/4/41'>41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/26'>8:26-39</a>) and (3) healing the sick (<a href='/NABRE/42/4/38'>LUK 4:38-40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/5/12'>5:12-16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/5/17'>17-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/6'>6:6-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/1'>7:1-10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/7/17'>17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/7/22'>22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/40'>8:40-59</a>)."
NABRE,42,9,3,[2] Take nothing for the journey: the absolute detachment required of the disciple (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/33'>LUK 14:33</a>) leads to complete reliance on God (<a href='/NABRE/42/12/22'>LUK 12:22-31</a>).

NABRE,42,9,7,"[4] 9:7-56 This section in which Luke gathers together incidents that focus on the identity of Jesus is introduced by a question that Herod is made to ask in this gospel: ""Who then is this about whom I hear such things?""(<a href='/NABRE/42/9/9'>LUK 9:9</a>) In subsequent episodes, Luke reveals to the reader various answers to Herods question: Jesus is one in whom Gods power is present and who provides for the needs of Gods people (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/10'>LUK 9:10-17</a>); Peter declares Jesus to be ""the Messiah of God"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/18'>LUK 9:18-21</a>); Jesus says he is the suffering Son of Man (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/22'>LUK 9:22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/9/43'>43-45</a>); Jesus is the Master to be followed, even to death (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/23'>LUK 9:23-27</a>); Jesus is Gods son, his Chosen One (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/28'>LUK 9:28-36</a>)."

NABRE,42,9,17,"[8] 9:18-22 This incident is based on <a href='/NABRE/41/8/27'>MAK 8:27-33</a>, but Luke has eliminated Peters refusal to accept Jesus as suffering Son of Man (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/32'>MAK 8:32</a>) and the rebuke of Peter by Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/33'>MAK 8:33</a>). Elsewhere in the gospel, Luke softens the harsh portrait of Peter and the other apostles found in his Marcan source (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/22/39'>LUK 22:39-46</a>, which similarly lacks a rebuke of Peter that occurs in the source, <a href='/NABRE/41/14/37'>MAK 14:37-38</a>)."

NABRE,42,9,27,"[12] 9:28-36 Situated shortly after the first announcement of the passion, death, and resurrection, this scene of Jesus transfiguration provides the heavenly confirmation to Jesus declaration that his suffering will end in glory (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/32'>LUK 9:32</a>); see also notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/17/1'>MAT 17:1-8</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/9/2'>MAK 9:2-8</a>."

NABRE,42,9,35,"[19] Like the heavenly voice that identified Jesus at his baptism prior to his undertaking the Galilean ministry (<a href='/NABRE/42/3/22'>LUK 3:22</a>), so too here before the journey to the city of destiny is begun (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/51'>LUK 9:51</a>) the heavenly voice again identifies Jesus as Son.

NABRE,42,9,46,[22] 9:46-50 These two incidents focus on attitudes that are opposed to Christian discipleship: rivalry and intolerance of outsiders.
NABRE,42,9,51,"[23] 9:51-18:14 The Galilean ministry of Jesus finishes with the previous episode and a new section of Lukes gospel begins, the journey to Jerusalem. This journey is based on <a href='/NABRE/41/10/1'>MAK 10:1-52</a> but Luke uses his Marcan source only in <a href='/NABRE/42/18/15'>LUK 18:15</a>-<a href='/NABRE/42/19/27'>19:27</a>. Before that point he has inserted into his gospel a distinctive collection of sayings of Jesus and stories about him that he has drawn from Q, a collection of sayings of Jesus used also by Matthew, and from his own special traditions. All of the material collected in this section is loosely organized within the framework of a journey of Jesus to Jerusalem, the city of destiny, where his exodus (suffering, death, resurrection, ascension) is to take place (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/31'>LUK 9:31</a>), where salvation is accomplished, and from where the proclamation of Gods saving word is to go forth (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/47'>LUK 24:47</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/1/8'>ACT 1:8</a>). Much of the material in the Lucan travel narrative is teaching for the disciples. During the course of this journey Jesus is preparing his chosen Galilean witnesses for the role they will play after his exodus (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/31'>LUK 9:31</a>): they are to be his witnesses to the people (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/39'>ACT 10:39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/31'>13:31</a>) and thereby provide certainty to the readers of Lukes gospel that the teachings they have received are rooted in the teachings of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/1'>LUK 1:1-4</a>)."
NABRE,42,9,51,"[24] 9:51-55 Just as the Galilean ministry began with a rejection of Jesus in his hometown, so too the travel narrative begins with the rejection of him by Samaritans. In this episode Jesus disassociates himself from the attitude expressed by his disciples that those who reject him are to be punished severely. The story alludes to <a href='/NABRE/12/1/10'>2KG 1:10, 12</a> where the prophet Elijah takes the course of action Jesus rejects, and Jesus thereby rejects the identification of himself with Elijah."
NABRE,42,9,51,"[25] Days for his being taken up: like the reference to his exodus in <a href='/NABRE/42/9/31'>LUK 9:31</a> this is probably a reference to all the events (suffering, death, resurrection, ascension) of his last days in Jerusalem. He resolutely determined: literally, ""he set his face."""
NABRE,42,9,52,"[26] Samaritan: Samaria was the territory between Judea and Galilee west of the Jordan river. For ethnic and religious reasons, the Samaritans and the Jews were bitterly opposed to one another (see <a href='/NABRE/43/4/9'>JHN 4:9</a>)."
NABRE,42,9,56,"[27] 9:57-62 In these sayings Jesus speaks of the severity and the unconditional nature of Christian discipleship. Even family ties and filial obligations, such as burying ones parents, cannot distract one no matter how briefly from proclaiming the kingdom of God. The first two sayings are paralleled in <a href='/NABRE/40/8/19'>MAT 8:19-22</a>; see also notes there."
NABRE,42,9,60,"[28] Let the dead bury their dead: i.e., let the spiritually dead (those who do not follow) bury their physically dead. See also note on <a href='/NABRE/40/8/22'>MAT 8:22</a>."
NABRE,42,10,1,[1] 10:1-12 Only the Gospel of Luke contains two episodes in which Jesus sends out his followers on a mission: the first (<a href='/NABRE/42/10/1'>LUK 10:1-6</a>) is based on the mission in <a href='/NABRE/41/6/6'>MAK 6:6</a>b-13 and recounts the sending out of the Twelve; here in <a href='/NABRE/42/10/1'>LUK 10:1-12</a> a similar report based on Q becomes the sending out of seventy-two in this gospel. The episode continues the theme of Jesus preparing witnesses to himself and his ministry. These witnesses include not only the Twelve but also the seventy-two who may represent the Christian mission in Lukes own day. Note that the instructions given to the Twelve and to the seventy-two are similar and that what is said to the seventy-two in <a href='/NABRE/42/10/4'>LUK 10:4</a> is directed to the Twelve in <a href='/NABRE/42/22/35'>LUK 22:35</a>.

NABRE,42,10,18,"[8] I have observed Satan fall like lightning: the effect of the mission of the seventy-two is characterized by the Lucan Jesus as a symbolic fall of Satan.

NABRE,42,10,25,"[10] 10:25-37 In response to a question from a Jewish legal expert about inheriting eternal life, Jesus illustrates the superiority of love over legalism through the story of the good Samaritan. The law of love proclaimed in the ""Sermon on the Plain"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/27'>LUK 6:27-36</a>) is exemplified by one whom the legal expert would have considered ritually impure (see <a href='/NABRE/43/4/9'>JHN 4:9</a>). Moreover, the identity of the ""neighbor"" requested by the legal expert (<a href='/NABRE/42/10/29'>LUK 10:29</a>) turns out to be a Samaritan, the enemy of the Jew (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/9/52'>LUK 9:52</a>)."

NABRE,42,10,37,[13] 10:38-42 The story of Martha and Mary further illustrates the importance of hearing the words of the teacher and the concern with women in Luke.

The first (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/1'>LUK 11:1-4</a>) recounts Jesus teaching his disciples the Christian communal prayer, the ""Our Father""; the second (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/5'>LUK 11:5-8</a>), the importance of persistence in prayer; the third (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/9'>LUK 11:9-13</a>), the effectiveness of prayer."

In answer to their question, Jesus presents them with an example of a Christian communal prayer that stresses the fatherhood of God and acknowledges him as the one to whom the Christian disciple owes daily sustenance (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/3'>LUK 11:3</a>), forgiveness (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/4'>LUK 11:4</a>), and deliverance from the final trial (<a href='/NABRE/42/11/4'>LUK 11:4</a>).

Controversies with or reprimands of Pharisees are regularly set by Luke within the context of Jesus eating with Pharisees (see <a href='/NABRE/42/5/29'>LUK 5:29-39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/36'>7:36-50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/14/1'>14:1-24</a>).

NABRE,42,11,44,[11] Unseen graves: contact with the dead or with human bones or graves (see <a href='/NABRE/4/19/16'>NUM 19:16</a>) brought ritual impurity. Jesus presents the Pharisees as those who insidiously lead others astray through their seeming attention to the law.

NABRE,42,12,34,[8] 12:35-48 This collection of sayings relates to Lukes understanding of the end time and the return of Jesus. Luke emphasizes for his readers the importance of being faithful to the instructions of Jesus in the period before the parousia.
NABRE,42,12,45,[9] My master is delayed in coming: this statement indicates that early Christian expectations for the imminent return of Jesus had undergone some modification. Luke cautions his readers against counting on such a delay and acting irresponsibly. Cf. the similar warning in <a href='/NABRE/40/24/48'>MAT 24:48</a>.
NABRE,42,12,48,[10] 12:49-53 Jesus proclamation of the kingdom is a refining and purifying fire. His message that meets with acceptance or rejection will be a source of conflict and dissension even within families.

NABRE,42,13,1,"[1] 13:1-5 The death of the Galileans at the hands of Pilate (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/1'>LUK 13:1</a>) and the accidental death of those on whom the tower fell (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/4'>LUK 13:4</a>) are presented by the Lucan Jesus as timely reminders of the need for all to repent, for the victims of these tragedies should not be considered outstanding sinners who were singled out for punishment."
NABRE,42,13,1,"[2] The slaughter of the Galileans by Pilate is unknown outside Luke; but from what is known about Pilate from the Jewish historian Josephus, such a slaughter would be in keeping with the character of Pilate. Josephus reports that Pilate had disrupted a religious gathering of the Samaritans on Mount Gerizim with a slaughter of the participants (Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/42/18/86'>18:86-87</a>), and that on another occasion Pilate had killed many Jews who had opposed him when he appropriated money from the temple treasury to build an aqueduct in Jerusalem (Jewish War <a href='/NABRE/42/2/175'>2:175-77</a>; Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/42/18/60'>18:60-62</a>)."
NABRE,42,13,4,[3] Like the incident mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/42/13/1'>LUK 13:1</a> nothing of this accident in Jerusalem is known outside Luke and the New Testament.
NABRE,42,13,5,"[4] 13:6-9 Following on the call to repentance in <a href='/NABRE/42/13/1'>LUK 13:1-5</a>, the parable of the barren fig tree presents a story about the continuing patience of God with those who have not yet given evidence of their repentance (see <a href='/NABRE/42/3/8'>LUK 3:8</a>). The parable may also be alluding to the delay of the end time, when punishment will be meted out, and the importance of preparing for the end of the age because the delay will not be permanent (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/8'>LUK 13:8-9</a>)."
NABRE,42,13,9,"[5] 13:10-17 The cure of the crippled woman on the sabbath and the controversy that results furnishes a parallel to an incident that will be reported by Luke in <a href='/NABRE/42/14/1'>14:1-6</a>, the cure of the man with dropsy on the sabbath. A characteristic of Lukes style is the juxtaposition of an incident that reveals Jesus concern for a man with an incident that reveals his concern for a woman; cf., e.g., <a href='/NABRE/42/7/11'>LUK 7:11-17</a> and <a href='/NABRE/42/8/49'>LUK 8:49-56</a>."
NABRE,42,13,15,"[6] 13:15-16 If the law as interpreted by Jewish tradition allowed for the untying of bound animals on the sabbath, how much more should this woman who has been bound by Satans power be freed on the sabbath from her affliction."
NABRE,42,13,16,[7] Whom Satan has bound: affliction and infirmity are taken as evidence of Satans hold on humanity. The healing ministry of Jesus reveals the gradual wresting from Satan of control over humanity and the establishment of Gods kingdom.
NABRE,42,13,18,[8] 13:18-21 Two parables are used to illustrate the future proportions of the kingdom of God that will result from its deceptively small beginning in the preaching and healing ministry of Jesus. They are paralleled in <a href='/NABRE/40/13/31'>MAT 13:31-33</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/4/30'>MAK 4:30-32</a>.
NABRE,42,13,21,[9] 13:22-30 These sayings of Jesus follow in Luke upon the parables of the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/18'>LUK 13:18-21</a>) and stress that great effort is required for entrance into the kingdom (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/24'>LUK 13:24</a>) and that there is an urgency to accept the present opportunity to enter because the narrow door will not remain open indefinitely (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/25'>LUK 13:25</a>). Lying behind the sayings is the rejection of Jesus and his message by his Jewish contemporaries (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/26'>LUK 13:26</a>) whose places at table in the kingdom will be taken by Gentiles from the four corners of the world (<a href='/NABRE/42/13/29'>LUK 13:29</a>). Those called last (the Gentiles) will precede those to whom the invitation to enter was first extended (the Jews). See also <a href='/NABRE/42/14/15'>LUK 14:15-24</a>.
NABRE,42,13,32,"[10] Nothing, not even Herods desire to kill Jesus, stands in the way of Jesus role in fulfilling Gods will and in establishing the kingdom through his exorcisms and healings."
NABRE,42,13,33,[11] It is impossible that a prophet should die outside of Jerusalem: Jerusalem is the city of destiny and the goal of the journey of the prophet Jesus. Only when he reaches the holy city will his work be accomplished.

NABRE,42,14,2,[2] Dropsy: an abnormal swelling of the body because of the retention and accumulation of fluid.
NABRE,42,14,5,"[3] Your son or ox: this is the reading of many of the oldest and most important New Testament manuscripts. Because of the strange collocation of sonand ox, some copyists have altered it to ""your ass or ox,"" on the model of the saying in <a href='/NABRE/42/13/15'>LUK 13:15</a>."
NABRE,42,14,6,[4] 14:7-14 The banquet scene found only in Luke provides the opportunity for these teachings of Jesus on humility and presents a setting to display Lukes interest in Jesus attitude toward the rich and the poor (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/42/4/18'>LUK 4:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>6:20-26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/13'>12:13-34</a>).
NABRE,42,14,14,"[5] 14:15-24 The parable of the great dinner is a further illustration of the rejection by Israel, Gods chosen people, of Jesus invitation to share in the banquet in the kingdom and the extension of the invitation to other Jews whose identification as the poor, crippled, blind, and lame (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/21'>LUK 14:21</a>) classifies them among those who recognize their need for salvation, and to Gentiles (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/23'>LUK 14:23</a>). A similar parable is found in <a href='/NABRE/40/22/1'>MAT 22:1-10</a>."
NABRE,42,14,24,"[6] 14:25-33 This collection of sayings, most of which are peculiar to Luke, focuses on the total dedication necessary for the disciple of Jesus. No attachment to family (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/26'>LUK 14:26</a>) or possessions (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/33'>LUK 14:33</a>) can stand in the way of the total commitment demanded of the disciple. Also, acceptance of the call to be a disciple demands readiness to accept persecution and suffering (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/27'>LUK 14:27</a>) and a realistic assessment of the hardships and costs (<a href='/NABRE/42/14/28'>LUK 14:28-32</a>)."
NABRE,42,14,26,[7] Hating his father…: cf. the similar saying in <a href='/NABRE/40/10/37'>MAT 10:37</a>. The disciples family must take second place to the absolute dedication involved in following Jesus (see also <a href='/NABRE/42/9/59'>LUK 9:59-62</a>).
NABRE,42,14,33,[8] 14:34-35 The simile of salt follows the sayings of Jesus that demanded of the disciple total dedication and detachment from family and possessions and illustrates the condition of one who does not display this total commitment. The halfhearted disciple is like salt that cannot serve its intended purpose. See the simile of salt in <a href='/NABRE/40/5/13'>MAT 5:13</a> and the note there.
NABRE,42,15,1,"[1] 15:1-32 To the parable of the lost sheep (<a href='/NABRE/42/15/1'>LUK 15:1-7</a>) that Luke shares with Matthew (<a href='/NABRE/40/18/12'>MAT 18:12-14</a>), Luke adds two parables (the lost coin, <a href='/NABRE/42/15/8'>LUK 15:8-10</a>; the prodigal son, <a href='/NABRE/42/15/11'>LUK 15:11-32</a>) from his own special tradition to illustrate Jesus particular concern for the lost and Gods love for the repentant sinner."
NABRE,42,15,8,"[2] Ten coins: literally, ""ten drachmas."" A drachma was a Greek silver coin."
NABRE,42,16,1,"[1] 16:1-8a The parable of the dishonest steward has to be understood in the light of the Palestinian custom of agents acting on behalf of their masters and the usurious practices common to such agents. The dishonesty of the steward consisted in the squandering of his masters property (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/1'>LUK 16:1</a>) and not in any subsequent graft. The master commends the dishonest steward who has forgone his own usurious commission on the business transaction by having the debtors write new notes that reflected only the real amount owed the master (i.e., minus the stewards profit). The dishonest steward acts in this way in order to ingratiate himself with the debtors because he knows he is being dismissed from his position (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/3'>LUK 16:3</a>). The parable, then, teaches the prudent use of ones material goods in light of an imminent crisis."
NABRE,42,16,6,"[2] One hundred measures: literally, ""one hundred baths."" A bath is a Hebrew unit of liquid measurement equivalent to eight or nine gallons."
NABRE,42,16,7,[3] One hundred kors: a koris a Hebrew unit of dry measure for grain or wheat equivalent to ten or twelve bushels.
NABRE,42,16,8,[4] 16:8b-13 Several originally independent sayings of Jesus are gathered here by Luke to form the concluding application of the parable of the dishonest steward.
NABRE,42,16,8,"[5] 16:8b-9 The first conclusion recommends the prudent use of ones wealth (in the light of the coming of the end of the age) after the manner of the children of this world, represented in the parable by the dishonest steward."
NABRE,42,16,9,"[6] Dishonest wealth: literally, ""mammon of iniquity."" Mammon is the Greek transliteration of a Hebrew or Aramaic word that is usually explained as meaning ""that in which one trusts."" The characterization of this wealth as dishonestexpresses a tendency of wealth to lead one to dishonesty. Eternal dwellings: or, ""eternal tents,"" i.e., heaven."
NABRE,42,16,10,[7] 16:10-12 The second conclusion recommends constant fidelity to those in positions of responsibility.
NABRE,42,16,13,[8] The third conclusion is a general statement about the incompatibility of serving God and being a slave to riches. To be dependent upon wealth is opposed to the teachings of Jesus who counseled complete dependence on the Father as one of the characteristics of the Christian disciple (<a href='/NABRE/42/12/22'>LUK 12:22-39</a>). God and mammon: see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/16/9'>LUK 16:9</a>. Mammon is used here as if it were itself a god.
NABRE,42,16,14,"[9] 16:14-18 The two parables about the use of riches in chap. <a href='/NABRE/42/16/1'>16</a> are separated by several isolated sayings of Jesus on the hypocrisy of the Pharisees (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/14'>LUK 16:14-15</a>), on the law (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/16'>LUK 16:16-17</a>), and on divorce (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/18'>LUK 16:18</a>)."
NABRE,42,16,14,"[10] 16:14-15 The Pharisees are here presented as examples of those who are slaves to wealth (see <a href='/NABRE/42/16/13'>LUK 16:13</a>) and, consequently, they are unable to serve God."
NABRE,42,16,16,"[11] John the Baptist is presented in Lukes gospel as a transitional figure between the period of Israel, the time of promise, and the period of Jesus, the time of fulfillment. With John, the fulfillment of the Old Testament promises has begun."
NABRE,42,16,18,"[12] 16:19-31 The parable of the rich man and Lazarus again illustrates Lukes concern with Jesus attitude toward the rich and the poor. The reversal of the fates of the rich man and Lazarus (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/22'>LUK 16:22-23</a>) illustrates the teachings of Jesus in Lukes ""Sermon on the Plain"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/6/24'>24-25</a>)."
NABRE,42,16,19,"[13] The oldest Greek manuscript of Luke dating from ca. A.D. 175-225 records the name of the rich man as an abbreviated form of ""Nineveh,"" but there is very little textual support in other manuscripts for this reading. ""Dives"" of popular tradition is the Latin Vulgates translation for ""rich man"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/19'>LUK 16:19-31</a>)."

It is not impossible that it should be taken as the beginning of the saying on forgiveness in <a href='/NABRE/42/17/3'>LUK 17:3</a>b-4.
NABRE,42,17,6,"[2] 17:7-10 These sayings of Jesus, peculiar to Luke, which continue his response to the apostles request to increase their faith (<a href='/NABRE/42/17/5'>LUK 17:5-6</a>), remind them that Christian disciples can make no claim on Gods graciousness; in fulfilling the exacting demands of discipleship, they are only doing their duty."
NABRE,42,17,10,"[3] 17:11-19 This incident recounting the thankfulness of the cleansed Samaritan leper is narrated only in Lukes gospel and provides an instance of Jesus holding up a non-Jew (<a href='/NABRE/42/17/18'>LUK 17:18</a>) as an example to his Jewish contemporaries (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/10/33'>LUK 10:33</a> where a similar purpose is achieved in the story of the good Samaritan). Moreover, it is the faith in Jesus manifested by the foreigner that has brought him salvation (<a href='/NABRE/42/17/19'>LUK 17:19</a>; cf. the similar relationship between faith and salvation in <a href='/NABRE/42/7/50'>LUK 7:50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/48'>8:48, 50</a>)."

NABRE,42,17,20,"[6] 17:20-37 To the question of the Pharisees about the time of the coming of Gods kingdom, Jesus replies that the kingdom is among you(<a href='/NABRE/42/17/20'>LUK 17:20-21</a>). The emphasis has thus been shifted from an imminent observable coming of the kingdom to something that is already present in Jesus preaching and healing ministry. Luke has also appended further traditional sayings of Jesus about the unpredictable suddenness of the day of the Son of Man, and assures his readers that in spite of the delay of that day (<a href='/NABRE/42/12/45'>LUK 12:45</a>), it will bring judgment unexpectedly on those who do not continue to be vigilant."
NABRE,42,17,21,"[7] Among you: the Greek preposition translated as amongcan also be translated as ""within."" In the light of other statements in Lukes gospel about the presence of the kingdom (see <a href='/NABRE/42/10/9'>LUK 10:9, 11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/11/20'>11:20</a>) ""among"" is to be preferred."
NABRE,42,17,36,"[8] The inclusion of <a href='/NABRE/42/17/36'>LUK 17:36</a>, ""There will be two men in the field; one will be taken, the other left behind,"" in some Western manuscripts appears to be a scribal assimilation to <a href='/NABRE/40/24/40'>MAT 24:40</a>."
NABRE,42,18,1,"[1] 18:1-14 The particularly Lucan material in the travel narrative concludes with two parables on prayer. The first (<a href='/NABRE/42/18/1'>LUK 18:1-8</a>) teaches the disciples the need of persistent prayer so that they not fall victims to apostasy (<a href='/NABRE/42/18/8'>LUK 18:8</a>). The second (<a href='/NABRE/42/18/9'>LUK 18:9-14</a>) condemns the self-righteous, critical attitude of the Pharisee and teaches that the fundamental attitude of the Christian disciple must be the recognition of sinfulness and complete dependence on Gods graciousness. The second parable recalls the story of the pardoning of the sinful woman (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/36'>LUK 7:36-50</a>) where a similar contrast is presented between the critical attitude of the Pharisee Simon and the love shown by the pardoned sinner."
NABRE,42,18,5,"[2] Strike me: the Greek verb translated as strike means ""to strike under the eye"" and suggests the extreme situation to which the persistence of the widow might lead. It may, however, be used here in the much weaker sense of ""to wear one out."""
NABRE,42,18,15,"[3] 18:15-19:27 Luke here includes much of the material about the journey to Jerusalem found in his Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/42/10/1'>LUK 10:1-52</a>) and adds to it the story of Zacchaeus (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/1'>LUK 19:1-10</a>) from his own particular tradition and the parable of the gold coins (minas) (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/11'>LUK 19:11-27</a>) from Q, the source common to Luke and Matthew."
NABRE,42,18,15,[4] 18:15-17 The sayings on children furnish a contrast to the attitude of the Pharisee in the preceding episode (<a href='/NABRE/42/18/9'>LUK 18:9-14</a>) and that of the wealthy official in the following one (<a href='/NABRE/42/18/18'>LUK 18:18-23</a>) who think that they can lay claim to Gods favor by their own merit. The attitude of the disciple should be marked by the receptivity and trustful dependence characteristic of the child.
NABRE,42,18,22,"[5] Detachment from material possessions results in the total dependence on God demanded of one who would inherit eternal life. Sell all that you have: the original saying (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/10/21'>MAK 10:21</a>) has characteristically been made more demanding by Lukes addition of ""all."""
NABRE,42,18,31,[6] 18:31-33 The details included in this third announcement of Jesus suffering and death suggest that the literary formulation of the announcement has been directed by the knowledge of the historical passion and death of Jesus.
NABRE,42,18,31,"[7] Everything written by the prophets…will be fulfilled: this is a Lucan addition to the words of Jesus found in the Marcan source (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/32'>MAK 10:32-34</a>). Luke understands the events of Jesus last days in Jerusalem to be the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy, but, as is usually the case in Luke-Acts, the author does not specify which Old Testament prophets he has in mind; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/24/25'>LUK 24:25, 27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/24/44'>44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/8'>ACT 3:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/27'>13:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/26/22'>26:22-23</a>."

Through this Son of David, salvation comes to the blind man. Note the connection between salvation and house of David mentioned earlier in Zechariahs canticle (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/69'>LUK 1:69</a>). See also note on <a href='/NABRE/40/9/27'>MAT 9:27</a>."
NABRE,42,19,1,"[1] 19:1-10 The story of the tax collector Zacchaeus is unique to this gospel. While a rich man (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/2'>LUK 19:2</a>), Zacchaeus provides a contrast to the rich man of <a href='/NABRE/42/18/18'>LUK 18:18-23</a> who cannot detach himself from his material possessions to become a follower of Jesus. Zacchaeus, according to Luke, exemplifies the proper attitude toward wealth: he promises to give half of his possessions to the poor (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/8'>LUK 19:8</a>) and consequently is the recipient of salvation (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/9'>LUK 19:9-10</a>)."
NABRE,42,19,9,"[2] A descendant of Abraham: literally, ""a son of Abraham."" The tax collector Zacchaeus, whose repentance is attested by his determination to amend his former ways, shows himself to be a true descendant of Abraham, the true heir to the promises of God in the Old Testament. Underlying Lukes depiction of Zacchaeus as a descendant of Abraham, the father of the Jews (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/73'>LUK 1:73</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/22'>16:22-31</a>), is his recognition of the central place occupied by Israel in the plan of salvation."
NABRE,42,19,10,[3] This verse sums up for Luke his depiction of the role of Jesus as savior in this gospel.
NABRE,42,19,10,"[4] 19:11-27 In this parable Luke has combined two originally distinct parables: (1) a parable about the conduct of faithful and productive servants (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/13'>LUK 19:13, 15</a>b-26) and (2) a parable about a rejected king (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/12'>LUK 19:12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/19/14'>14-15</a>a, 27). The story about the conduct of servants occurs in another form in <a href='/NABRE/40/25/14'>MAT 25:14-20</a>. The story about the rejected king may have originated with a contemporary historical event. After the death of Herod the Great, his son Archelaus traveled to Rome to receive the title of king. A delegation of Jews appeared in Rome before Caesar Augustus to oppose the request of Archelaus. Although not given the title of king, Archelaus was made ruler over Judea and Samaria. As the story is used by Luke, however, it furnishes a correction to the expectation of the imminent end of the age and of the establishment of the kingdom in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/11'>LUK 19:11</a>). Jesus is not on his way to Jerusalem to receive the kingly power; for that, he must go away and only after returning from the distant country (a reference to the parousia) will reward and judgment take place."
NABRE,42,19,13,"[5] Ten gold coins: literally, ""ten minas."" A mina was a monetary unit that in ancient Greece was the equivalent of one hundred drachmas."
NABRE,42,19,28,"[6] 19:28-21:38 With the royal entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, a new section of Lukes gospel begins, the ministry of Jesus in Jerusalem before his death and resurrection. Luke suggests that this was a lengthy ministry in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/47'>LUK 19:47</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/20/1'>20:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/21/37'>21:37-38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/22/53'>22:53</a>) and it is characterized by Jesus daily teaching in the temple (<a href='/NABRE/42/21/37'>LUK 21:37-38</a>). For the story of the entry of Jesus into Jerusalem, see also <a href='/NABRE/40/21/1'>MAT 21:1-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/11/1'>MAK 11:1-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/12/12'>JHN 12:12-19</a> and the notes there."
NABRE,42,19,38,[7] Blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord: only in Luke is Jesus explicitly given the title kingwhen he enters Jerusalem in triumph. Luke has inserted this title into the words of <a href='/NABRE/19/118/26'>PS 118:26</a> that heralded the arrival of the pilgrims coming to the holy city and to the temple. Jesus is thereby acclaimed as king(see <a href='/NABRE/42/1/32'>LUK 1:32</a>) and as the one who comes(see <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/19'>LUK 7:19</a>). Peace in heaven…: the acclamation of the disciples of Jesus in Luke echoes the announcement of the angels at the birth of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/2/14'>LUK 2:14</a>). The peace Jesus brings is associated with the salvation to be accomplished here in Jerusalem.
NABRE,42,19,39,"[8] Rebuke your disciples: this command, found only in Luke, was given so that the Roman authorities would not interpret the acclamation of Jesus as king as an uprising against them; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/23/2'>LUK 23:2-3</a>."
NABRE,42,19,40,"[9] 19:41-44 The lament for Jerusalem is found only in Luke. By not accepting Jesus (the one who mediates peace), Jerusalem will not find peace but will become the victim of devastation."
NABRE,42,19,43,[10] 19:43-44 Luke may be describing the actual disaster that befell Jerusalem in A.D. 70 when it was destroyed by the Romans during the First Revolt.
NABRE,42,19,45,"[11] 19:45-46 Immediately upon entering the holy city, Jesus in a display of his authority enters the temple (see <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1-3</a>) and lays claim to it after cleansing it that it might become a proper place for his teaching ministry in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/42/19/47'>LUK 19:47</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/20/1'>20:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/21/37'>21:37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/22/53'>22:53</a>).

NABRE,42,20,8,[1] 20:9-19 This parable about an absentee landlord and a tenant farmers revolt reflects the social and economic conditions of rural Palestine in the first century. The synoptic gospel writers use the parable to describe how the rejection of the landlords son becomes the occasion for the vineyard to be taken away from those to whom it was entrusted (the religious leadership of Judaism that rejects the teaching and preaching of Jesus; <a href='/NABRE/42/20/19'>LUK 20:19</a>).
NABRE,42,20,15,[2] They threw him out of the vineyard and killed him: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/12/8'>MAK 12:8</a>. Luke has altered his Marcan source and reports that the murder of the son takes place outside the vineyard to reflect the tradition of Jesus death outside the walls of the city of Jerusalem (see <a href='/NABRE/58/13/12'>HEB 13:12</a>).
NABRE,42,20,20,"[3] The governor: i.e., Pontius Pilate, the Roman administrator responsible for the collection of taxes and maintenance of order in Palestine."
NABRE,42,20,22,[4] Through their question the agents of the Jerusalem religious leadership hope to force Jesus to take sides on one of the sensitive political issues of first-century Palestine. The issue of nonpayment of taxes to Rome becomes one of the focal points of the First Jewish Revolt (A.D. 66-70) that resulted in the Roman destruction of Jerusalem and the temple.

Jesus rejects their naive understanding of the resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/42/20/35'>LUK 20:35-36</a>) and then argues on behalf of the resurrection of the dead on the basis of the written law (<a href='/NABRE/42/20/37'>LUK 20:37-38</a>) that the Sadducees accept.

NABRE,42,20,40,"[9] 20:41-44 After successfully answering the three questions of his opponents, Jesus now asks them a question. Their inability to respond implies that they have forfeited their position and authority as the religious leaders of the people because they do not understand the scriptures. This series of controversies between the religious leadership of Jerusalem and Jesus reveals Jesus as the authoritative teacher whose words are to be listened to (see <a href='/NABRE/42/9/35'>LUK 9:35</a>). See also notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/22/41'>MAT 22:41-46</a>."
NABRE,42,21,1,[1] 21:1-4 The widow is another example of the poor ones in this gospel whose detachment from material possessions and dependence on God leads to their blessedness (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20</a>). Her simple offering provides a striking contrast to the pride and pretentiousness of the scribes denounced in the preceding section (<a href='/NABRE/42/20/45'>LUK 20:45-47</a>). The story is taken from <a href='/NABRE/41/12/41'>MAK 12:41-44</a>.
NABRE,42,21,5,"[2] 21:5-36 Jesus eschatological discourse in Luke is inspired by <a href='/NABRE/41/13/1'>MAK 13</a> but Luke has made some significant alterations to the words of Jesus found there. Luke maintains, though in a modified form, the belief in the early expectation of the end of the age (see <a href='/NABRE/42/21/27'>LUK 21:27, 28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/21/31'>31</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/21/32'>32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/21/36'>36</a>), but, by focusing attention throughout the gospel on the importance of the day-to-day following of Jesus and by reinterpreting the meaning of some of the signs of the end from <a href='/NABRE/41/13/1'>MAK 13</a> he has come to terms with what seemed to the early Christian community to be a delay of the parousia. Mark, for example, described the desecration of the Jerusalem temple by the Romans (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14</a>) as the apocalyptic symbol (see <a href='/NABRE/27/9/27'>DAN 9:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/12/11'>12:11</a>) accompanying the end of the age and the coming of the Son of Man. Luke (<a href='/NABRE/42/21/20'>LUK 21:20-24</a>), however, removes the apocalyptic setting and separates the historical destruction of Jerusalem from the signs of the coming of the Son of Man by a period that he refers to as ""the times of the Gentiles"" (<a href='/NABRE/42/21/24'>LUK 21:24</a>). See also notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/24/1'>MAT 24:1-36</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/13/1'>MAK 13:1-37</a>."
NABRE,42,21,8,"[3] The time has come: in Luke, the proclamation of the imminent end of the age has itself become a false teaching."
NABRE,42,21,12,"[4] Before all this happens…: to Luke and his community, some of the signs of the end just described (<a href='/NABRE/42/21/10'>LUK 21:10-11</a>) still lie in the future. Now in dealing with the persecution of the disciples (<a href='/NABRE/42/21/12'>LUK 21:12-19</a>) and the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/42/21/20'>LUK 21:20-24</a>) Luke is pointing to eschatological signs that have already been fulfilled."

NABRE,42,22,1,"[1] 22:1-23:56a The passion narrative. Luke is still dependent upon Mark for the composition of the passion narrative but has incorporated much of his own special tradition into the narrative. Among the distinctive sections in Luke are: (1) the tradition of the institution of the Eucharist (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/15'>LUK 22:15-20</a>); (2) Jesus farewell discourse (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/21'>LUK 22:21-38</a>); (3) the mistreatment and interrogation of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/63'>LUK 22:63-71</a>); (4) Jesus before Herod and his second appearance before Pilate (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/6'>LUK 23:6-16</a>); (5) words addressed to the women followers on the way to the crucifixion (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/27'>LUK 23:27-32</a>); (6) words to the penitent thief (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/39'>LUK 23:39-41</a>); (7) the death of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/46'>LUK 23:46, 47</a>b-49).

NABRE,42,22,15,"[5] This Passover: Luke clearly identifies this last supper of Jesus with the apostles as a Passover meal that commemorated the deliverance of the Israelites from slavery in Egypt. Jesus reinterprets the significance of the Passover by setting it in the context of the kingdom of God (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/16'>LUK 22:16</a>). The ""deliverance"" associated with the Passover finds its new meaning in the blood that will be shed (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/20'>LUK 22:20</a>)."
NABRE,42,22,17,[6] Because of a textual problem in <a href='/NABRE/42/22/19'>LUK 22:19-20</a> some commentators interpret this cup as the eucharistic cup.
NABRE,42,22,19,"[7] 22:19c-20 Which will be given…do this in memory of me: these words are omitted in some important Western text manuscripts and a few Syriac manuscripts. Other ancient text types, including the oldest papyrus manuscript of Luke dating from the late second or early third century, contain the longer reading presented here. The Lucan account of the words of institution of the Eucharist bears a close resemblance to the words of institution in the Pauline tradition (see <a href='/NABRE/46/11/23'>1CO 11:23-26</a>). See also notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/26/26'>MAT 26:26-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/27'>26:27-28</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/41/14/22'>MAK 14:22-24</a>."
NABRE,42,22,24,[8] 22:24-38 The Gospel of Luke presents a brief farewell discourse of Jesus; compare the lengthy farewell discourses and prayer in <a href='/NABRE/43/13/1'>JHN 13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/43/17/1'>17</a>.
NABRE,42,22,25,[9] Benefactors: this word occurs as a title of rulers in the Hellenistic world.
NABRE,42,22,31,"[10] 22:31-32 Jesus prayer for Simons faith and the commission to strengthen his brothers anticipates the post-resurrectional prominence of Peter in the first half of Acts, where he appears as the spokesman for the Christian community and the one who begins the mission to the Gentiles (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/1'>ACT 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/44/11/1'>11</a>)."
NABRE,42,22,31,"[11] All of you: literally, ""you."" The translation reflects the meaning of the Greek text that uses a second person plural pronoun here."

NABRE,42,22,38,[13] It is enough!: the farewell discourse ends abruptly with these words of Jesus spoken to the disciples when they take literally what was intended as figurative language about being prepared to face the worlds hostility.
NABRE,42,22,42,"[14] 22:43-44 These verses, though very ancient, were probably not part of the original text of Luke. They are absent from the oldest papyrus manuscripts of Luke and from manuscripts of wide geographical distribution."
NABRE,42,22,51,[15] And healed him: only Luke recounts this healing of the injured servant.
NABRE,42,22,61,[16] Only Luke recounts that the Lord turned and looked at Peter. This look of Jesus leads to Peters weeping bitterly over his denial (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/62'>LUK 22:62</a>).
NABRE,42,22,65,[17] 22:66-71 Luke recounts one daytime trial of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/66'>LUK 22:66-71</a>) and hints at some type of preliminary nighttime investigation (<a href='/NABRE/42/22/54'>LUK 22:54-65</a>). Mark (and Matthew who follows Mark) has transferred incidents of this day into the nighttime interrogation with the result that there appear to be two Sanhedrin trials of Jesus in Mark (and Matthew); see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/14/53'>MAK 14:53</a>.
NABRE,42,22,66,"[18] Sanhedrin: the word is a Hebraized form of a Greek word meaning a ""council,"" and refers to the elders, chief priests, and scribes who met under the high priests leadership to decide religious and legal questions that did not pertain to Romes interests. Jewish sources are not clear on the competence of the Sanhedrin to sentence and to execute during this period."

This stress on the innocence of Jesus before the Roman authorities is also characteristic of Johns gospel (<a href='/NABRE/43/18/38'>JHN 18:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/19/4'>19:4, 6</a>). Luke presents the Jerusalem Jewish leaders as the ones who force the hand of the Roman authorities (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/1'>LUK 23:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/23/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/23/10'>10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/23/13'>13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/23/18'>18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/23/21'>21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/23/23'>23-25</a>)."
NABRE,42,23,6,"[2] 23:6-12 The appearance of Jesus before Herod is found only in this gospel. Herod has been an important figure in Luke (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/7'>LUK 9:7-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/13/31'>13:31-33</a>) and has been presented as someone who has been curious about Jesus for a long time. His curiosity goes unrewarded. It is faith in Jesus, not curiosity, that is rewarded (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/50'>LUK 7:50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/8/48'>8:48, 50</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/17/19'>17:19</a>)."
NABRE,42,23,17,"[3] This verse, ""He was obliged to release one prisoner for them at the festival,"" is not part of the original text of Luke. It is an explanatory gloss from <a href='/NABRE/41/15/6'>MAK 15:6</a> (also <a href='/NABRE/40/27/15'>MAT 27:15</a>) and is not found in many early and important Greek manuscripts. On its historical background, see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/15'>MAT 27:15-26</a>."
NABRE,42,23,25,[4] 23:26-32 An important Lucan theme throughout the gospel has been the need for the Christian disciple to follow in the footsteps of Jesus. Here this theme comes to the fore with the story of Simon of Cyrene who takes up the cross and follows Jesus (see <a href='/NABRE/42/9/23'>LUK 9:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/14/27'>14:27</a>) and with the large crowd who likewise follow Jesus on the way of the cross. See also note on <a href='/NABRE/41/15/21'>MAK 15:21</a>.

NABRE,42,23,39,"[6] 23:39-43 This episode is recounted only in this gospel. The penitent sinner receives salvation through the crucified Jesus. Jesus words to the penitent thief reveal Lukes understanding that the destiny of the Christian is ""to be with Jesus."""
NABRE,42,23,44,"[7] Noon…three in the afternoon: literally, the sixth and ninth hours. See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/15/25'>MAK 15:25</a>."
NABRE,42,23,47,"[8] This man was innocent: or, ""This man was righteous."""
NABRE,42,24,1,"[1] 24:1-53 The resurrection narrative in Luke consists of five sections: (1) the women at the empty tomb (<a href='/NABRE/42/23/56'>LUK 23:56</a>b-24:12); (2) the appearance to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/13'>LUK 24:13-35</a>); (3) the appearance to the disciples in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/36'>LUK 24:36-43</a>); (4) Jesus final instructions (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/44'>LUK 24:44-49</a>); (5) the ascension (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/50'>LUK 24:50-53</a>). In Luke, all the resurrection appearances take place in and around Jerusalem; moreover, they are all recounted as having taken place on Easter Sunday. A consistent theme throughout the narrative is that the suffering, death, and resurrection of Jesus were accomplished in fulfillment of Old Testament promises and of Jewish hopes (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/19'>LUK 24:19</a>a, 21, 26-27, 44, 46). In his second volume, Acts, Luke will argue that Christianity is the fulfillment of the hopes of Pharisaic Judaism and its logical development (see <a href='/NABRE/44/24/10'>ACT 24:10-21</a>)."
NABRE,42,24,6,"[2] He is not here, but he has been raised: this part of the verse is omitted in important representatives of the Western text tradition, but its presence in other text types and the slight difference in wording from <a href='/NABRE/40/28/6'>MAT 28:6</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/16/6'>MAK 16:6</a> argue for its retention."
NABRE,42,24,9,"[3] The women in this gospel do not flee from the tomb and tell no one, as in <a href='/NABRE/41/16/8'>MAK 16:8</a> but return and tell the disciples about their experience. The initial reaction to the testimony of the women is disbelief (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/11'>LUK 24:11</a>)."
NABRE,42,24,12,[4] This verse is missing from the Western textual tradition but is found in the best and oldest manuscripts of other text types.
NABRE,42,24,12,"[5] 24:13-35 This episode focuses on the interpretation of scripture by the risen Jesus and the recognition of him in the breaking of the bread. The references to the quotations of scripture and explanation of it (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/25'>LUK 24:25-27</a>), the kerygmatic proclamation (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/34'>LUK 24:34</a>), and the liturgical gesture (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/30'>LUK 24:30</a>) suggest that the episode is primarily catechetical and liturgical rather than apologetic."
NABRE,42,24,13,"[6] Seven miles: literally, ""sixty stades."" A stade was 607 feet. Some manuscripts read ""160 stades"" or more than eighteen miles. The exact location of Emmaus is disputed."
NABRE,42,24,16,[7] A consistent feature of the resurrection stories is that the risen Jesus was different and initially unrecognizable (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/37'>LUK 24:37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/16/12'>MAK 16:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/20/14'>JHN 20:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/21/4'>21:4</a>).
NABRE,42,24,26,"[8] That the Messiah should suffer…: Luke is the only New Testament writer to speak explicitly of a suffering Messiah (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/26'>LUK 24:26, 46</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/18'>ACT 3:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/17/3'>17:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/26/23'>26:23</a>). The idea of a suffering Messiah is not found in the Old Testament or in other Jewish literature prior to the New Testament period, although the idea is hinted at in <a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31-33</a>. See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/26/63'>MAT 26:63</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/26/67'>26:67-68</a>."
NABRE,42,24,36,"[9] 24:36-43, 44-49 The Gospel of Luke, like each of the other gospels (<a href='/NABRE/40/28/16'>MAT 28:16-20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/16/14'>MAK 16:14-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/20/19'>JHN 20:19-23</a>), focuses on an important appearance of Jesus to the Twelve in which they are commissioned for their future ministry. As in <a href='/NABRE/42/24/6'>LUK 24:6, 12</a>, so in <a href='/NABRE/42/24/36'>LUK 24:36, 40</a> there are omissions in the Western text."
NABRE,42,24,39,[10] 24:39-42 The apologetic purpose of this story is evident in the concern with the physical details and the report that Jesus ate food.
NABRE,42,24,46,[11] See note on <a href='/NABRE/42/24/26'>LUK 24:26</a>.
NABRE,42,24,49,"[12] The promise of my Father: i.e., the gift of the holy Spirit."
NABRE,42,24,49,"[13] 24:50-53 Luke brings his story about the time of Jesus to a close with the report of the ascension. He will also begin the story of the time of the church with a recounting of the ascension. In the gospel, Luke recounts the ascension of Jesus on Easter Sunday night, thereby closely associating it with the resurrection. In <a href='/NABRE/44/1/3'>ACT 1:3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/1/9'>9-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/31'>13:31</a> he historicizes the ascension by speaking of a forty-day period between the resurrection and the ascension. The Western text omits some phrases in <a href='/NABRE/42/24/51'>LUK 24:51, 52</a> perhaps to avoid any chronological conflict with <a href='/NABRE/44/1/1'>ACT 1</a> about the time of the ascension."
NABRE,42,24,53,"[14] The Gospel of Luke ends as it began (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/9'>LUK 1:9</a>), in the Jerusalem temple."
NABRE,43,1,1,"[1] 1:1-18 The prologue states the main themes of the gospel: life, light, truth, the world, testimony, and the preexistence of Jesus Christ, the incarnate Logos, who reveals God the Father. In origin, it was probably an early Christian hymn. Its closest parallel is in other christological hymns, <a href='/NABRE/51/1/15'>COL 1:15-20</a> and <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-11</a>. Its core (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/1'>JHN 1:1-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/1/10'>10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/1/14'>14</a>) is poetic in structure, with short phrases linked by ""staircase parallelism,"" in which the last word of one phrase becomes the first word of the next. Prose inserts (at least <a href='/NABRE/43/1/6'>JHN 1:6-8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/1/15'>15</a>) deal with John the Baptist."
NABRE,43,1,1,"[2] In the beginning: also the first words of the Old Testament (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/1'>GEN 1:1</a>). Was: this verb is used three times with different meanings in this verse: existence, relationship, and predication. The Word(Greek logos): this term combines Gods dynamic, creative word (Genesis), personified preexistent Wisdom as the instrument of Gods creative activity (Proverbs), and the ultimate intelligibility of reality (Hellenistic philosophy). With God: the Greek preposition here connotes communication with another. Was God: lack of a definite article with ""God"" in Greek signifies predication rather than identification."
NABRE,43,1,3,"[3] What came to be: while the oldest manuscripts have no punctuation here, the corrector of Bodmer Papyrus P75, some manuscripts, and the Ante-Nicene Fathers take this phrase with what follows, as staircase parallelism. Connection with <a href='/NABRE/43/1/3'>JHN 1:3</a> reflects fourth-century anti-Arianism."
NABRE,43,1,5,"[4] The ethical dualism of light and darkness is paralleled in intertestamental literature and in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Overcome: ""comprehend"" is another possible translation, but cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/12/35'>JHN 12:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/7/29'>WIS 7:29-30</a>."
NABRE,43,1,6,"[5] John was sentjust as Jesus was ""sent"" (<a href='/NABRE/43/4/34'>JHN 4:34</a>) in divine mission. Other references to John the Baptist in this gospel emphasize the differences between them and Johns subordinate role."
NABRE,43,1,7,"[6] Testimony: the testimony theme of John is introduced, which portrays Jesus as if on trial throughout his ministry. All testify to Jesus: John the Baptist, the Samaritan woman, scripture, his works, the crowds, the Spirit, and his disciples."
NABRE,43,1,11,"[7] What was his own…his own people: first a neuter, literally, ""his own property/possession"" (probably = Israel), then a masculine, ""his own people"" (the Israelites)."
NABRE,43,1,13,"[8] Believers in Jesus become children of God not through any of the three natural causes mentioned but through God who is the immediate cause of the new spiritual life. Were born: the Greek verb can mean ""begotten"" (by a male) or ""born"" (from a female or of parents). The variant ""he who was begotten,"" asserting Jesus virginal conception, is weakly attested in Old Latin and Syriac versions."
NABRE,43,1,14,"[9] Flesh: the whole person, used probably against docetic tendencies (cf. <a href='/NABRE/62/4/2'>1JN 4:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/63/1/7'>2JN 1:7</a>). Made his dwelling: literally, ""pitched his tent/tabernacle."" Cf. the tabernacle or tent of meeting that was the place of Gods presence among his people (<a href='/NABRE/2/25/8'>EXO 25:8-9</a>). The incarnate Word is the new mode of Gods presence among his people. The Greek verb has the same consonants as the Aramaic word for Gods presence (Shekinah). Glory: Gods visible manifestation of majesty in power, which once filled the tabernacle (<a href='/NABRE/2/40/34'>EXO 40:34</a>) and the temple (<a href='/NABRE/11/8/10'>1KG 8:10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/11/8/27'>27</a>), is now centered in Jesus. Only Son: Greek, monogenēs, but see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/18'>JHN 1:18</a>. Grace and truth: these words may represent two Old Testament terms describing Yahweh in covenant relationship with Israel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/34/6'>EXO 34:6</a>), thus Gods ""love"" and ""fidelity."" The Word shares Yahwehs covenant qualities."
NABRE,43,1,15,"[10] This verse, interrupting <a href='/NABRE/43/1/14'>JHN 1:14, 16</a> seems drawn from <a href='/NABRE/43/1/30'>JHN 1:30</a>."
NABRE,43,1,16,"[11] Grace in place of grace: replacement of the Old Covenant with the New (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/17'>JHN 1:17</a>). Other possible translations are ""grace upon grace"" (accumulation) and ""grace for grace"" (correspondence)."
NABRE,43,1,18,"[12] The only Son, God: while the vast majority of later textual witnesses have another reading, ""the Son, the only one"" or ""the only Son,"" the translation above follows the best and earliest manuscripts, monogenēs theos, but takes the first term to mean not just ""Only One"" but to include a filial relationship with the Father, as at <a href='/NABRE/42/9/38'>LUK 9:38</a> (""only child"") or <a href='/NABRE/58/11/17'>HEB 11:17</a> (""only son"") and as translated at <a href='/NABRE/43/1/14'>JHN 1:14</a>. The Logos is thus ""only Son"" and God but not Father/God."
NABRE,43,1,19,[13] 1:19-51 The testimony of John the Baptist about the Messiah and Jesus self-revelation to the first disciples. This section constitutes the introduction to the gospel proper and is connected with the prose inserts in the prologue. It develops the major theme of testimony in four scenes: Johns negative testimony about himself; his positive testimony about Jesus; the revelation of Jesus to Andrew and Peter; the revelation of Jesus to Philip and Nathanael.
NABRE,43,1,19,"[14] The Jews: throughout most of the gospel, the ""Jews"" does not refer to the Jewish people as such but to the hostile authorities, both Pharisees and Sadducees, particularly in Jerusalem, who refuse to believe in Jesus. The usage reflects the atmosphere, at the end of the first century, of polemics between church and synagogue, or possibly it refers to Jews as representative of a hostile world (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/10'>JHN 1:10-11</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,20,"[15] Messiah: the anointed agent of Yahweh, usually considered to be of Davidic descent. See further the note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/41'>JHN 1:41</a>."
NABRE,43,1,21,[16] Elijah: the Baptist did not claim to be Elijah returned to earth (cf. <a href='/NABRE/39/3/19'>MAL 3:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/11/14'>MAT 11:14</a>). The Prophet: probably the prophet like Moses (<a href='/NABRE/5/18/15'>DEU 18:15</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/3/22'>ACT 3:22</a>).
NABRE,43,1,23,"[17] This is a repunctuation and reinterpretation (as in the synoptic gospels and Septuagint) of the Hebrew text of <a href='/NABRE/23/40/3'>ISA 40:3</a> which reads, ""A voice cries out: In the desert prepare the way of the Lord."""
NABRE,43,1,24,"[18] Some Pharisees: other translations, such as ""Now they had been sent from the Pharisees,"" misunderstand the grammatical construction. This is a different group from that in <a href='/NABRE/43/1/19'>JHN 1:19</a>; the priests and Levites would have been Sadducees, not Pharisees."
NABRE,43,1,26,"[19] I baptize with water: the synoptics add ""but he will baptize you with the holy Spirit"" (<a href='/NABRE/41/1/8'>MAK 1:8</a>) or ""…holy Spirit and fire"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/11'>MAT 3:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/3/16'>LUK 3:16</a>). Johns emphasis is on purification and preparation for a better baptism."
NABRE,43,1,28,"[20] Bethany across the Jordan: site unknown. Another reading is ""Bethabara."""
NABRE,43,1,29,"[21] The Lamb of God: the background for this title may be the victorious apocalyptic lamb who would destroy evil in the world (<a href='/NABRE/66/5/1'>REV 5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/66/7/1'>7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/17/14'>17:14</a>); the paschal lamb, whose blood saved Israel (<a href='/NABRE/2/12/1'>EXO 12</a>); and/or the suffering servant led like a lamb to the slaughter as a sin-offering (<a href='/NABRE/23/53/7'>ISA 53:7, 10</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,30,"[22] He existed before me: possibly as Elijah (to come, <a href='/NABRE/43/1/27'>JHN 1:27</a>); for the evangelist and his audience, Jesus preexistence would be implied (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/1'>JHN 1:1</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,31,"[23] I did not know him: this gospel shows no knowledge of the tradition (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/1'>LUK 1</a>) about the kinship of Jesus and John the Baptist. The reason why I came baptizing with water: in this gospel, Johns baptism is not connected with forgiveness of sins; its purpose is revelatory, that Jesus may be made known to Israel."
NABRE,43,1,32,"[24] Like a dove: a symbol of the new creation (<a href='/NABRE/1/8/8'>GEN 8:8</a>) or the community of Israel (<a href='/NABRE/28/11/11'>HOS 11:11</a>). Remain: the first use of a favorite verb in John, emphasizing the permanency of the relationship between Father and Son (as here) and between the Son and the Christian. Jesus is the permanent bearer of the Spirit."
NABRE,43,1,34,"[25] The Son of God: this reading is supported by good Greek manuscripts, including the Chester Beatty and Bodmer Papyri and the Vatican Codex, but is suspect because it harmonizes this passage with the synoptic version: ""This is my beloved Son"" (<a href='/NABRE/40/3/17'>MAT 3:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/1/11'>MAK 1:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/3/22'>LUK 3:22</a>). The poorly attested alternate reading, ""Gods chosen One,"" is probably a reference to the Servant of Yahweh (<a href='/NABRE/23/42/1'>ISA 42:1</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,36,[26] John the Baptists testimony makes his disciples following of Jesus plausible.
NABRE,43,1,37,"[27] The two disciples: Andrew (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/40'>JHN 1:40</a>) and, traditionally, John, son of Zebedee (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/13/23'>JHN 13:23</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,39,"[28] Four in the afternoon: literally, the tenth hour, from sunrise, in the Roman calculation of time. Some suggest that the next day, beginning at sunset, was the sabbath; they would have stayed with Jesus to avoid travel on it."
NABRE,43,1,41,"[29] Messiah: the Hebrew word māšîaḥ, ""anointed one"" (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>LUK 2:11</a>), appears in Greek as the transliterated messiasonly here and in <a href='/NABRE/43/4/25'>JHN 4:25</a>. Elsewhere the Greek translation christosis used."
NABRE,43,1,42,"[30] Simon, the son of John: in <a href='/NABRE/40/16/17'>MAT 16:17</a>, Simon is called Bariōna, ""son of Jonah,"" a different tradition for the name of Simons father. Cephas: in Aramaic = the Rock; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/18'>MAT 16:18</a>. Neither the Greek equivalent Petrosnor, with one isolated exception, Cephasis attested as a personal name before Christian times."
NABRE,43,1,43,"[31] He: grammatically, could be Peter, but logically is probably Jesus."
NABRE,43,1,47,"[32] A true Israelite. There is no duplicity in him: Jacob was the first to bear the name ""Israel"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/32/29'>GEN 32:29</a>), but Jacob was a man of duplicity (<a href='/NABRE/1/27/35'>GEN 27:35-36</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,48,[1] Under the fig tree: a symbol of messianic peace (cf. <a href='/NABRE/33/4/4'>MIC 4:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/3/10'>ZEC 3:10</a>).
NABRE,43,1,49,"[2] Son of God: this title is used in the Old Testament, among other ways, as a title of adoption for the Davidic king (<a href='/NABRE/10/7/14'>2SM 7:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/2/7'>PS 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/89/27'>89:27</a>), and thus here, with King of Israel, in a messianic sense. For the evangelist, Son of Godalso points to Jesus divinity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/20/28'>JHN 20:28</a>)."
NABRE,43,1,50,"[3] Possibly a statement: ""You [singular] believe because I saw you under the fig tree."""
NABRE,43,1,51,"[4] The double ""Amen"" is characteristic of John. Youis plural in Greek. The allusion is to Jacobs ladder (<a href='/NABRE/1/28/12'>GEN 28:12</a>)."
NABRE,43,2,1,"[1] 2:1-6:71 Signs revealing Jesus as the Messiah to all Israel. ""Sign"" (sēmeion) is Johns symbolic term for Jesus wondrous deeds (see Introduction). The Old Testament background lies in the Exodus story (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/11/3'>DEU 11:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/29/2'>29:2</a>). John is interested primarily in what the sēmeiasignify: Gods intervention in human history in a new way through Jesus."
NABRE,43,2,1,[2] 2:1-11 The first sign. This story of replacement of Jewish ceremonial washings (<a href='/NABRE/43/2/6'>JHN 2:6</a>) presents the initial revelation about Jesus at the outset of his ministry. He manifests his glory; the disciples believe. There is no synoptic parallel.
NABRE,43,2,1,[3] Cana: unknown from the Old Testament. The mother of Jesus: she is never named in John.
NABRE,43,2,4,"[4] This verse may seek to show that Jesus did not work miracles to help his family and friends, as in the apocryphal gospels. Woman: a normal, polite form of address, but unattested in reference to ones mother. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/43/19/26'>JHN 19:26</a>.

My hour has not yet come: the translation as a question (""Has not my hour now come?""), while preferable grammatically and supported by Greek Fathers, seems unlikely from a comparison with <a href='/NABRE/43/7/6'>JHN 7:6, 30</a>. The ""hour"" is that of Jesus passion, death, resurrection, and ascension (<a href='/NABRE/43/13/1'>JHN 13:1</a>)."
NABRE,43,2,6,"[5] Twenty to thirty gallons: literally, ""two or three measures""; the Attic liquid measure contained 39.39 liters.

NABRE,43,2,12,[8] 2:12-3:21 The next three episodes take place in Jerusalem. Only the first is paralleled in the synoptic gospels.
NABRE,43,2,12,[9] This transitional verse may be a harmonization with the synoptic tradition in <a href='/NABRE/42/4/31'>LUK 4:31</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/4/13'>MAT 4:13</a>. There are many textual variants. John depicts no extended ministry in Capernaum as do the synoptics.
NABRE,43,2,13,[10] 2:13-22 This episode indicates the post-resurrectional replacement of the temple by the person of Jesus.
NABRE,43,2,13,"[11] Passover: this is the first Passover mentioned in John; a second is mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/43/6/4'>JHN 6:4</a>; a third in <a href='/NABRE/43/13/1'>JHN 13:1</a>. Taken literally, they point to a ministry of at least two years."
NABRE,43,2,14,"[12] 2:14-22 The other gospels place the cleansing of the temple in the last days of Jesus life (Matthew, on the day Jesus entered Jerusalem; Mark, on the next day). The order of events in the gospel narratives is often determined by theological motives rather than by chronological data."
NABRE,43,2,14,"[13] Oxen, sheep, and doves: intended for sacrifice. The doves were the offerings of the poor (<a href='/NABRE/3/5/7'>LEV 5:7</a>). Money-changers: for a temple tax paid by every male Jew more than nineteen years of age, with a half-shekel coin (<a href='/NABRE/2/30/11'>EXO 30:11-16</a>), in Syrian currency. See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/17/24'>MAT 17:24</a>."
NABRE,43,2,17,"[14] <a href='/NABRE/19/69/10'>PS 69:10</a>, changed to future tense to apply to Jesus."
NABRE,43,2,19,"[15] This saying about the destruction of the temple occurs in various forms (<a href='/NABRE/40/24/2'>MAT 24:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/27/40'>27:40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/13/2'>MAK 13:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/15/29'>15:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/21/6'>LUK 21:6</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/6/14'>ACT 6:14</a>). <a href='/NABRE/40/26/61'>MAT 26:61</a> has: ""I candestroy the temple of God…""; see note there. In <a href='/NABRE/41/14/58'>MAK 14:58</a>, there is a metaphorical contrast with a new temple: ""I will destroy this temple made with handsand within three days I will build another not made with hands."" Here it is symbolic of Jesus resurrection and the resulting community (see <a href='/NABRE/43/2/21'>JHN 2:21</a> and <a href='/NABRE/66/21/2'>REV 21:2</a>). In three days: an Old Testament expression for a short, indefinite period of time; cf. <a href='/NABRE/28/6/2'>HOS 6:2</a>."
NABRE,43,2,20,"[16] Forty-six years: based on references in Josephus (Jewish Wars <a href='/NABRE/43/1/401'>1:401</a>; Antiquities <a href='/NABRE/43/15/380'>15:380</a>), possibly the spring of A.D. 28. Cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/42/3/1'>LUK 3:1</a>."
NABRE,43,3,1,"[1] 3:1-21 Jesus instructs Nicodemus on the necessity of a new birth from above. This scene in Jerusalem at Passover exemplifies the faith engendered by signs (<a href='/NABRE/43/2/23'>JHN 2:23</a>). It continues the self-manifestation of Jesus in Jerusalem begun in <a href='/NABRE/43/2/1'>JHN 2</a>. This is the first of the Johannine discourses, shifting from dialogue to monologue (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/11'>JHN 3:11-15</a>) to reflection of the evangelist (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/16'>JHN 3:16-21</a>). The shift from singular through <a href='/NABRE/43/3/10'>JHN 3:10</a> to plural in <a href='/NABRE/43/3/11'>JHN 3:11</a> may reflect the early churchs controversy with the Jews."
NABRE,43,3,1,"[2] A ruler of the Jews: most likely a member of the Jewish council, the Sanhedrin; see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/8/31'>MAK 8:31</a>."
NABRE,43,3,3,"[3] Born: see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/13'>JHN 1:13</a>. From above: the Greek adverb anōthenmeans both ""from above"" and ""again."" Jesus means ""from above"" (see <a href='/NABRE/43/3/31'>JHN 3:31</a>) but Nicodemus misunderstands it as ""again."" This misunderstanding serves as a springboard for further instruction."
NABRE,43,3,8,"[4] Wind: the Greek word pneuma(as well as the Hebrew rûah) means both ""wind"" and ""spirit."" In the play on the double meaning, ""wind"" is primary."
NABRE,43,3,14,"[5] Lifted up: in <a href='/NABRE/4/21/9'>NUM 21:9</a>, Moses simply ""mounted"" a serpent upon a pole. John here substitutes a verb implying glorification. Jesus, exalted to glory at his cross and resurrection, represents healing for all."
NABRE,43,3,15,"[6] Eternal life: used here for the first time in John, this term stresses quality of life rather than duration."
NABRE,43,3,16,"[7] Gave: as a gift in the incarnation, and also ""over to death"" in the crucifixion; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/8/32'>ROM 8:32</a>."
NABRE,43,3,17,"[8] 3:17-19 Condemn: the Greek root means both judgment and condemnation. Jesus purpose is to save, but his coming provokes judgment; some condemn themselves by turning from the light."
NABRE,43,3,19,[9] Judgment is not only future but is partially realized here and now.
NABRE,43,3,22,"[10] 3:22-26 Jesus ministry in Judea is only loosely connected with <a href='/NABRE/43/2/13'>JHN 2:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/43/3/21'>3:21</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/19'>JHN 1:19-36</a>. Perhaps John the Baptists further testimony was transposed here to give meaning to ""water"" in <a href='/NABRE/43/3/5'>JHN 3:5</a>. Jesus is depicted as baptizing (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/22'>JHN 3:22</a>); contrast <a href='/NABRE/43/4/2'>JHN 4:2</a>."
NABRE,43,3,23,"[11] Aenon near Salim: site uncertain, either in the upper Jordan valley or in Samaria."
NABRE,43,3,24,[12] A remark probably intended to avoid objections based on a chronology like that of the synoptics (<a href='/NABRE/40/4/12'>MAT 4:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/1/14'>MAK 1:14</a>).
NABRE,43,3,25,"[13] A Jew: some think Jesus is meant. Many manuscripts read ""Jews."""
NABRE,43,3,29,"[14] The best man: literally, ""the friend of the groom,"" the shoshbenof Jewish tradition, who arranged the wedding. Competition between him and the groom would be unthinkable."
NABRE,43,3,30,"[15] 3:31-36 It is uncertain whether these are words by the Baptist, Jesus, or the evangelist. They are reflections on the two preceding scenes."
NABRE,43,3,34,"[16] His gift: of God or to Jesus, perhaps both. This verse echoes <a href='/NABRE/43/3/5'>JHN 3:5, 8</a>."
NABRE,43,4,1,"[1] 4:1-42 Jesus in Samaria. The self-revelation of Jesus continues with his second discourse, on his mission to ""half-Jews."" It continues the theme of replacement, here with regard to cult (<a href='/NABRE/43/4/21'>JHN 4:21</a>). Water (<a href='/NABRE/43/4/7'>JHN 4:7-15</a>) serves as a symbol (as at Cana and in the Nicodemus episode)."
NABRE,43,4,2,"[2] An editorial refinement of <a href='/NABRE/43/3/22'>JHN 3:22</a>, perhaps directed against followers of John the Baptist who claimed that Jesus imitated him."
NABRE,43,4,4,"[3] He had to: a theological necessity; geographically, Jews often bypassed Samaria by taking a route across the Jordan."
NABRE,43,4,5,"[4] Sychar: Jerome identifies this with Shechem, a reading found in Syriac manuscripts."
NABRE,43,4,9,"[5] Samaritan women were regarded by Jews as ritually impure, and therefore Jews were forbidden to drink from any vessel they had handled."
NABRE,43,4,10,"[6] Living water: the water of life, i.e., the revelation that Jesus brings; the woman thinks of ""flowing water,"" so much more desirable than stagnant well water. On Johns device of such misunderstanding, cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/43/3/3'>JHN 3:3</a>."
NABRE,43,4,11,"[7] Sir: the Greek kyriosmeans ""master"" or ""lord,"" as a respectful mode of address for a human being or a deity; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/4/19'>JHN 4:19</a>. It is also the word used in the Septuagint for the Hebrew adônai, substituted for the tetragrammaton YHWH."
NABRE,43,4,20,"[8] This mountain: Gerizim, on which a temple was erected in the fourth century B.C. by Samaritans to rival Mount Zion in Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/27/4'>DEU 27:4</a> (Mount Ebal = the Jews term for Gerizim)."
NABRE,43,4,23,"[9] In Spirit and truth: not a reference to an interior worship within ones own spirit. The Spirit is the spirit given by God that reveals truth and enables one to worship God appropriately (<a href='/NABRE/43/14/16'>JHN 14:16-17</a>). Cf. ""born of water and Spirit"" (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/5'>JHN 3:5</a>)."
NABRE,43,4,25,[10] The expectations of the Samaritans are expressed here in Jewish terminology. They did not expect a messianic king of the house of David but a prophet like Moses (<a href='/NABRE/5/18/15'>DEU 18:15</a>).
NABRE,43,4,26,"[11] I am he: it could also be translated ""I am,"" an Old Testament self-designation of Yahweh (<a href='/NABRE/23/43/3'>ISA 43:3</a>, etc.); cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/6/20'>JHN 6:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/8/24'>8:24, 28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/8/58'>58</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/13/19'>13:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/18/5'>18:5-6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/18/8'>8</a>. See note on <a href='/NABRE/41/6/50'>MAK 6:50</a>."
NABRE,43,4,27,[12] Talking with a woman: a religious and social restriction that Jesus is pictured treating as unimportant.
NABRE,43,4,35,[13] In four months… : probably a proverb; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/9/37'>MAT 9:37-38</a>.
NABRE,43,4,36,[14] Already: this word may go with the preceding verse rather than with <a href='/NABRE/43/4/36'>JHN 4:36</a>.
NABRE,43,4,39,"[15] The woman is presented as a missionary, described in virtually the same words as the disciples are in Jesus prayer (<a href='/NABRE/43/17/20'>JHN 17:20</a>)."
NABRE,43,4,43,"[16] 4:43-54 Jesus arrival in Cana in Galilee; the second sign. This section introduces another theme, that of the life-giving word of Jesus. It is explicitly linked to the first sign (<a href='/NABRE/43/2/11'>JHN 2:11</a>). The royal official believes (<a href='/NABRE/43/4/50'>JHN 4:50</a>). The natural life given his son is a sign of eternal life."
NABRE,43,4,44,"[17] Probably a reminiscence of a tradition as in <a href='/NABRE/41/6/4'>MAK 6:4</a>. Cf. Gospel of Thomas 31: ""No prophet is acceptable in his village, no physician heals those who know him."""
NABRE,43,4,45,[18] 4:46-54 The story of the cure of the royal officials son may be a third version of the cure of the centurions son (<a href='/NABRE/40/8/5'>MAT 8:5-13</a>) or servant (<a href='/NABRE/42/7/1'>LUK 7:1-10</a>). Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/40/15/21'>MAT 15:21-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/7/24'>MAK 7:24-30</a>.
NABRE,43,5,1,"[1] The reference in <a href='/NABRE/43/5/45'>JHN 5:45-46</a> to Moses suggests that the feast was Pentecost. The connection of that feast with the giving of the law to Moses on Sinai, attested in later Judaism, may already have been made in the first century. The feast could also be Passover (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/6/4'>JHN 6:4</a>). John stresses that the day was a sabbath (<a href='/NABRE/43/5/9'>JHN 5:9</a>)."
NABRE,43,5,2,"[2] There is no noun with Sheep. ""Gate"" is supplied on the grounds that there must have been a gate in the NE wall of the temple area where animals for sacrifice were brought in; cf. <a href='/NABRE/16/3/1'>NEH 3:1, 32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/16/12/39'>12:39</a>. Hebrew: more precisely, Aramaic. Bethesda: preferred to variants ""Be(th)zatha"" and ""Bethsaida""; bêt-ešdatayīnis given as the name of a double pool northeast of the temple area in the Qumran Copper Roll. Five porticoes: a pool excavated in Jerusalem actually has five porticoes."
NABRE,43,5,3,"[3] The Caesarean and Western recensions, followed by the Vulgate, add ""waiting for the movement of the water."" Apparently an intermittent spring in the pool bubbled up occasionally (see <a href='/NABRE/43/5/7'>JHN 5:7</a>). This turbulence was believed to cure."
NABRE,43,5,4,"[4] Toward the end of the second century in the West and among the fourth-century Greek Fathers, an additional verse was known: ""For [from time to time] an angel of the Lord used to come down into the pool; and the water was stirred up, so the first one to get in [after the stirring of the water] was healed of whatever disease afflicted him."" The angel was a popular explanation of the turbulence and the healing powers attributed to it. This verse is missing from all early Greek manuscripts and the earliest versions, including the original Vulgate. Its vocabulary is markedly non-Johannine."
NABRE,43,5,14,"[5] While the cure of the paralytic in <a href='/NABRE/41/2/1'>MAK 2:1-12</a> is associated with the forgiveness of sins, Jesus never drew a one-to-one connection between sin and suffering (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/9/3'>JHN 9:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/1'>LUK 12:1-5</a>), as did <a href='/NABRE/26/18/20'>EZE 18:20</a>."
NABRE,43,5,17,"[6] Sabbath observance (<a href='/NABRE/43/5/10'>JHN 5:10</a>) was based on Gods resting on the seventh day (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/2'>GEN 2:2-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/20/11'>EXO 20:11</a>). Philo and some rabbis insisted that Gods providence remains active on the sabbath, keeping all things in existence, giving life in birth and taking it away in death. Other rabbis taught that God rested from creating, but not from judging (= ruling, governing). Jesus here claims the same authority to work as the Father, and, in the discourse that follows, the same divine prerogatives: power over life and death (<a href='/NABRE/43/5/21'>JHN 5:21</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/24'>24-26</a>) and judgment (<a href='/NABRE/43/5/22'>JHN 5:22, 27</a>)."
NABRE,43,5,19,[7] This proverb or parable is taken from apprenticeship in a trade: the activity of a son is modeled on that of his father. Jesus dependence on the Father is justification for doing what the Father does.
NABRE,43,5,21,"[8] Gives life: in the Old Testament, a divine prerogative (<a href='/NABRE/5/32/39'>DEU 32:39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/2/6'>1SM 2:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/12/5/7'>2KG 5:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/68/13/2'>TOB 13:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/26/19'>ISA 26:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/12/2'>DAN 12:2</a>)."
NABRE,43,5,22,"[9] Judgment: another divine prerogative, often expressed as acquittal or condemnation (<a href='/NABRE/5/32/36'>DEU 32:36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/43/1'>PS 43:1</a>)."
NABRE,43,5,28,"[10] 5:28-29 While <a href='/NABRE/43/5/19'>JHN 5:19-27</a> present realized eschatology, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/28'>JHN 5:28-29</a> are future eschatology; cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/12/2'>DAN 12:2</a>."
NABRE,43,5,32,"[11] Another: likely the Father, who in four different ways gives testimony to Jesus, as indicated in the verse groupings <a href='/NABRE/43/5/33'>JHN 5:33-34</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/36'>36</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/37'>37-38</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/39'>39-40</a>."
NABRE,43,5,35,"[12] Lamp: cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/132/17'>PS 132:17</a>—""I will place a lamp for my anointed (= David),"" and possibly the description of Elijah in <a href='/NABRE/71/48/1'>SIR 48:1</a>. But only for a while, indicating the temporary and subordinate nature of Johns mission."
NABRE,43,5,39,"[13] You search: this may be an imperative: ""Search the scriptures, because you think that you have eternal life through them."""
NABRE,43,5,41,"[14] Praise: the same Greek word means ""praise"" or ""honor"" (from others) and ""glory"" (from God). There is a play on this in <a href='/NABRE/43/5/44'>JHN 5:44</a>."
NABRE,43,6,1,"[1] 6:1-15 This story of the multiplication of the loaves is the fourth sign (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/43/5/1'>JHN 5:1-47</a>). It is the only miracle story found in all four gospels (occurring twice in Mark and Matthew). See notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/14/13'>MAT 14:13-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/15/32'>15:32-39</a>. John differs on the roles of Philip and Andrew, the proximity of Passover (<a href='/NABRE/43/6/4'>JHN 6:4</a>), and the allusion to Elisha (see <a href='/NABRE/43/6/9'>JHN 6:9</a>). The story here symbolizes the food that is really available through Jesus. It connotes a new exodus and has eucharistic overtones."
NABRE,43,6,1,[2] [Of Tiberias]: the awkward apposition represents a later name of the Sea of Galilee. It was probably originally a marginal gloss.
NABRE,43,6,5,"[3] Jesus takes the initiative (in the synoptics, the disciples do), possibly pictured as (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/6/14'>JHN 6:14</a>) the new Moses (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/11/13'>NUM 11:13</a>)."
NABRE,43,6,6,[4] Probably the evangelists comment; in this gospel Jesus is never portrayed as ignorant of anything.
NABRE,43,6,7,"[5] Days wages: literally, ""denarii""; a Roman denarius is a days wage in <a href='/NABRE/40/20/2'>MAT 20:2</a>."
NABRE,43,6,9,[6] Barley loaves: the food of the poor. There seems an allusion to the story of Elisha multiplying the barley bread in <a href='/NABRE/12/4/42'>2KG 4:42-44</a>.
NABRE,43,6,10,"[7] Grass: implies springtime, and therefore Passover. Five thousand: so <a href='/NABRE/41/6/39'>MAK 6:39, 44</a> and parallels."
NABRE,43,6,13,"[8] Baskets: the word describes the typically Palestinian wicker basket, as in <a href='/NABRE/41/6/43'>MAK 6:43</a> and parallels."
NABRE,43,6,14,"[9] The Prophet: probably the prophet like Moses (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/21'>JHN 1:21</a>). The one who is to come into the world: probably Elijah; cf. <a href='/NABRE/39/3/1'>MAL 3:1, 23</a>."
NABRE,43,6,15,"[10] 6:16-21 The fifth sign is a nature miracle, portraying Jesus sharing Yahwehs power. Cf. the parallel stories following the multiplication of the loaves in <a href='/NABRE/41/6/45'>MAK 6:45-52</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/14/22'>MAT 14:22-33</a>."
NABRE,43,6,19,"[11] Walking on the sea: although the Greek (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/6/16'>JHN 6:16</a>) could mean ""on the seashore"" or ""by the sea"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/21/1'>JHN 21:1</a>), the parallels, especially <a href='/NABRE/40/14/25'>MAT 14:25</a>, make clear that Jesus walked upon the water. John may allude to <a href='/NABRE/18/9/8'>JOB 9:8</a>: God ""treads upon the crests of the sea."""
NABRE,43,6,20,"[12] It is I: literally, ""I am."" See also notes on <a href='/NABRE/43/4/26'>JHN 4:26</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/6/50'>MAK 6:50</a>."
NABRE,43,6,22,"[13] 6:22-71 Discourse on the bread of life; replacement of the manna. <a href='/NABRE/43/6/22'>JHN 6:22-34</a> serve as an introduction, <a href='/NABRE/43/6/35'>JHN 6:35-59</a> constitute the discourse proper, <a href='/NABRE/43/6/60'>JHN 6:60-71</a> portray the reaction of the disciples and Peters confession."
NABRE,43,6,23,"[14] Possibly a later interpolation, to explain how the crowd got to Capernaum."
NABRE,43,6,27,"[15] The food that endures for eternal life: cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/4/14'>JHN 4:14</a>, on water ""springing up to eternal life."""
NABRE,43,6,31,"[16] Bread from heaven: cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/16/4'>EXO 16:4, 15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/16/32'>32-34</a> and the notes there; <a href='/NABRE/19/78/24'>PS 78:24</a>. The manna, thought to have been hidden by Jeremiah (<a href='/NABRE/75/2/5'>2MA 2:5-8</a>), was expected to reappear miraculously at Passover, in the last days."
NABRE,43,6,35,"[17] 6:35-59 Up to <a href='/NABRE/43/6/50'>JHN 6:50</a> ""bread of life"" is a figure for Gods revelation in Jesus; in <a href='/NABRE/43/6/51'>JHN 6:51-58</a>, the eucharistic theme comes to the fore. There may thus be a break between <a href='/NABRE/43/6/50'>JHN 6:50-51</a>."
NABRE,43,6,43,"[18] Murmuring: the word may reflect the Greek of <a href='/NABRE/2/16/2'>EXO 16:2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/2/16/7'>7-8</a>."
NABRE,43,6,54,"[19] 6:54-58 Eats: the verb used in these verses is not the classical Greek verb used of human eating, but that of animal eating: ""munch,"" ""gnaw."" This may be part of Johns emphasis on the reality of the flesh and blood of Jesus (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/6/55'>JHN 6:55</a>), but the same verb eventually became the ordinary verb in Greek meaning ""eat."""
NABRE,43,6,59,[20] 6:60-71 These verses refer more to themes of <a href='/NABRE/43/6/35'>JHN 6:35-50</a> than to those of <a href='/NABRE/43/6/51'>JHN 6:51-58</a> and seem to be addressed to members of the Johannine community who found it difficult to accept the high christology reflected in the bread of life discourse.
NABRE,43,6,62,[21] This unfinished conditional sentence is obscure. Probably there is a reference to <a href='/NABRE/43/6/49'>JHN 6:49-51</a>. Jesus claims to be the bread that comes down from heaven(<a href='/NABRE/43/6/50'>JHN 6:50</a>); this claim provokes incredulity (<a href='/NABRE/43/6/60'>JHN 6:60</a>); and so Jesus is pictured as asking what his disciples will say when he goes up to heaven.
NABRE,43,6,63,"[22] Spirit…flesh: probably not a reference to the eucharistic body of Jesus but to the supernatural and the natural, as in <a href='/NABRE/43/3/6'>JHN 3:6</a>. Spirit and life: all Jesus said about the bread of life is the revelation of the Spirit."
NABRE,43,7,1,"[1] 7-8 These chapters contain events about the feast of Tabernacles (Sukkoth, Ingathering: <a href='/NABRE/2/23/16'>EXO 23:16</a>; Tents, Booths: <a href='/NABRE/5/16/13'>DEU 16:13-16</a>), with its symbols of booths (originally built to shelter harvesters), rain (water from Siloam poured on the temple altar), and lights (illumination of the four torches in the Court of the Women). They continue the theme of the replacement of feasts (Passover, <a href='/NABRE/43/2/13'>JHN 2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/6/4'>6:4</a>; Hanukkah, <a href='/NABRE/43/10/22'>JHN 10:22</a>; Pentecost, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/1'>JHN 5:1</a>), here accomplished by Jesus as the Living Water. These chapters comprise seven miscellaneous controversies and dialogues. There is a literary inclusion with Jesus in hiding in <a href='/NABRE/43/7/4'>JHN 7:4, 10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/8/59'>8:59</a>. There are frequent references to attempts on his life: <a href='/NABRE/43/7/1'>JHN 7:1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/13'>13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/19'>19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/25'>25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/30'>30</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/32'>32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/44'>44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/8/37'>8:37</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/40'>40</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/7/59'>59</a>."

NABRE,43,7,8,"[4] I am not going up: an early attested reading ""not yet"" seems a correction, since Jesus in the story does go up to the feast. ""Go up,"" in a play on words, refers not only to going up to Jerusalem but also to exaltation at the cross, resurrection, and ascension; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/3/14'>JHN 3:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/6/62'>6:62</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/20/17'>20:17</a>."
NABRE,43,7,13,[5] 7:14-31 Jesus teaches in the temple; debate with the Jews.
NABRE,43,7,15,"[6] Without having studied: literally, ""How does he know letters without having learned?"" Children were taught to read and write by means of the scriptures. But here more than Jesus literacy is being discussed; the people are wondering how he can teach like a rabbi. Rabbis were trained by other rabbis and traditionally quoted their teachers."
NABRE,43,7,17,"[7] To do his will: presumably a reference back to the ""work"" of <a href='/NABRE/43/6/29'>JHN 6:29</a>: belief in the one whom God has sent."
NABRE,43,7,20,"[8] You are possessed: literally, ""You have a demon."" The insane were thought to be possessed by a demoniacal spirit."

NABRE,43,7,35,"[12] Dispersion: or ""diaspora"": Jews living outside Palestine. Greeks: probably refers to the Gentiles in the Mediterranean area; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/12/20'>JHN 12:20</a>."
NABRE,43,7,36,"[13] 7:37, 39 Promise of living water through the Spirit."
NABRE,43,7,38,"[14] Living water: not an exact quotation from any Old Testament passage; in the gospel context the gift of the Spirit is meant; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/3/5'>JHN 3:5</a>. From within him: either Jesus or the believer; if Jesus, it continues the Jesus-Moses motif (water from the rock, <a href='/NABRE/2/17/6'>EXO 17:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/20/11'>NUM 20:11</a>) as well as Jesus as the new temple (cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/47/1'>EZE 47:1</a>). Grammatically, it goes better with the believer."
NABRE,43,7,39,"[15] No Spirit yet: Codex Vaticanus and early Latin, Syriac, and Coptic versions add ""given."" In this gospel, the sending of the Spirit cannot take place until Jesus glorification through his death, resurrection, and ascension; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/20/22'>JHN 20:22</a>."

NABRE,43,8,1,"[1] 7:53-8:11 The story of the woman caught in adultery is a later insertion here, missing from all early Greek manuscripts. A Western text-type insertion, attested mainly in Old Latin translations, it is found in different places in different manuscripts: here, or after <a href='/NABRE/43/7/36'>JHN 7:36</a> or at the end of this gospel, or after <a href='/NABRE/42/21/38'>LUK 21:38</a>, or at the end of that gospel. There are many non-Johannine features in the language, and there are also many doubtful readings within the passage. The style and motifs are similar to those of Luke, and it fits better with the general situation at the end of <a href='/NABRE/42/21/1'>LUK 21</a>, but it was probably inserted here because of the allusion to <a href='/NABRE/24/17/13'>JER 17:13</a> (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/43/8/6'>JHN 8:6</a>) and the statement, ""I do not judge anyone,"" in <a href='/NABRE/43/8/15'>JHN 8:15</a>. The Catholic Church accepts this passage as canonical scripture."
NABRE,43,8,2,[2] Mount of Olives: not mentioned elsewhere in the gospel tradition outside of passion week.
NABRE,43,8,6,"[3] <a href='/NABRE/3/20/10'>LEV 20:10</a> and <a href='/NABRE/5/22/22'>DEU 22:22</a> mention only death, but <a href='/NABRE/5/22/23'>DEU 22:23-24</a> prescribes stoning for a betrothed virgin."
NABRE,43,8,7,"[4] Cf. <a href='/NABRE/24/17/13'>JER 17:13</a> (RSV): ""Those who turn away from thee shall be written in the earth, for they have forsaken the Lord, the fountain of living water""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/7/38'>JHN 7:38</a>."

NABRE,43,8,12,[6] 8:12-20 Jesus the light of the world. Jesus replaces the four torches of the illumination of the temple as the light of joy.
NABRE,43,8,15,"[7] My testimony can be verified: this seems to contradict <a href='/NABRE/43/5/31'>JHN 5:31</a>, but the emphasis here is on Jesus origin from the Father and his divine destiny. Where I am going: indicates Jesus passion and glorification."
NABRE,43,8,16,"[8] By appearances: literally, ""according to the flesh."" I do not judge anyone: superficial contradiction of <a href='/NABRE/43/5/22'>JHN 5:22, 27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/5/30'>30</a>; here the emphasis is that the judgment is not by material standards."
NABRE,43,8,18,[9] Your law: a reflection of later controversy between church and synagogue.
NABRE,43,8,21,[10] 8:21-30 He whose ambassador I am is with me. Jesus origin is from God; he can reveal God.
NABRE,43,8,22,"[11] You will die in your sin: i.e., of disbelief; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/8/24'>JHN 8:24</a>. Where I am going you cannot come: except through faith in Jesus passion-resurrection."
NABRE,43,8,23,[12] The Jews suspect that he is referring to his death. Johannine irony is apparent here; Jesus death will not be self-inflicted but destined by God.
NABRE,43,8,25,"[13] 8:24, 28 I AM: an expression that late Jewish tradition understood as Yahwehs own self-designation (<a href='/NABRE/23/43/10'>ISA 43:10</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/4/26'>JHN 4:26</a>. Jesus is here placed on a par with Yahweh."
NABRE,43,8,26,"[14] What I told you from the beginning: this verse seems textually corrupt, with several other possible translations: ""(I am) what I say to you""; ""Why do I speak to you at all?"" The earliest attested reading (Bodmer Papyrus P66) has (in a second hand), ""I told you at the beginning what I am also telling you (now)."" The answer here (cf. <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>PRO 8:22</a>) seems to hinge on a misunderstanding of <a href='/NABRE/43/8/24'>JHN 8:24</a> ""thatI AM"" as ""whatI am."""
NABRE,43,8,31,"[15] 8:31-59 Jesus origin (""before Abraham"") and destiny are developed; the truth will free them from sin (<a href='/NABRE/43/8/34'>JHN 8:34</a>) and death (<a href='/NABRE/43/8/51'>JHN 8:51</a>)."
NABRE,43,8,32,"[16] Those Jews who believed in him: a rough editorial suture, since in <a href='/NABRE/43/8/37'>JHN 8:37</a> they are described as trying to kill Jesus."
NABRE,43,8,34,"[17] Have never been enslaved to anyone: since, historically, the Jews were enslaved almost continuously, this verse is probably Johannine irony, about slavery to sin."
NABRE,43,8,36,"[18] A slave…a son: an allusion to Ishmael and Isaac (<a href='/NABRE/1/16/1'>GEN 16</a>; 21), or to the release of a slave after six years (<a href='/NABRE/2/21/2'>EXO 21:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/15/12'>DEU 15:12</a>)."
NABRE,43,8,39,"[19] The Father: i.e., God. It is also possible, however, to understand the second part of the verse as a sarcastic reference to descent of the Jews from the devil (<a href='/NABRE/43/8/44'>JHN 8:44</a>), ""You do what you have heard from [your] father."""
NABRE,43,8,40,[20] The works of Abraham: Abraham believed; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/4/11'>ROM 4:11-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/59/2/21'>JAM 2:21-23</a>.

NABRE,43,8,57,"[23] He saw it: this seems a reference to the birth of Isaac (<a href='/NABRE/1/17/7'>GEN 17:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/21/6'>21:6</a>), the beginning of the fulfillment of promises about Abrahams seed."
NABRE,43,8,58,"[24] The evidence of the third-century Bodmer Papyrus P75and the first hand of Codex Sinaiticus indicates that the text originally read: ""How can Abraham have seen you?"""
NABRE,43,8,59,"[25] Came to be, I AM: the Greek word used for ""came to be"" is the one used of all creation in the prologue, while the word used for ""am"" is the one reserved for the Logos."
NABRE,43,9,1,"[1] 9:1-10:21 Sabbath healing of the man born blind. This sixth sign is introduced to illustrate the saying, ""I am the light of the world"" (<a href='/NABRE/43/8/12'>JHN 8:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/9/5'>9:5</a>). The narrative of conflict about Jesus contrasts Jesus (light) with the Jews (blindness, <a href='/NABRE/43/9/39'>JHN 9:39-41</a>). The theme of water is reintroduced in the reference to the pool of Siloam. Ironically, Jesus is being judged by the Jews, yet the Jews are judged by the Light of the world; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/3/19'>JHN 3:19-21</a>."
NABRE,43,9,2,"[2] See note on <a href='/NABRE/43/5/14'>JHN 5:14</a>, and <a href='/NABRE/2/20/5'>EXO 20:5</a>, that parents sins were visited upon their children. Jesus denies such a cause and emphasizes the purpose: the infirmity was providential."
NABRE,43,9,7,"[3] Go wash: perhaps a test of faith; cf. <a href='/NABRE/12/5/10'>2KG 5:10-14</a>. The water tunnel Siloam (= Sent) is used as a symbol of Jesus, sent by his Father."
NABRE,43,9,14,"[4] In using spittle, kneading clay, and healing, Jesus had broken the sabbath rules laid down by Jewish tradition."
NABRE,43,9,22,"[5] This comment of the evangelist (in terms used again in <a href='/NABRE/43/12/42'>JHN 12:42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/16/2'>16:2</a>) envisages a situation after Jesus ministry. Rejection/excommunication from the synagogue of Jews who confessed Jesus as Messiah seems to have begun ca. A.D. 85, when the curse against the mînîmor heretics was introduced into the ""Eighteen Benedictions."""
NABRE,43,9,24,[6] Give God the praise!: an Old Testament formula of adjuration to tell the truth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/7/19'>JOS 7:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/6/5'>1SM 6:5</a> LXX. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/5/41'>JHN 5:41</a>.

NABRE,43,9,39,"[8] 9:39-41 These verses spell out the symbolic meaning of the cure; the Pharisees are not the innocent blind, willing to accept the testimony of others."
NABRE,43,10,1,"[1] 10:1-21 The good shepherd discourse continues the theme of attack on the Pharisees that ends <a href='/NABRE/43/9/1'>JHN 9</a>. The figure is allegorical: the hired hands are the Pharisees who excommunicated the cured blind man. It serves as a commentary on <a href='/NABRE/43/9/1'>JHN 9</a>. For the shepherd motif, used of Yahweh in the Old Testament, cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/34/1'>EXO 34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/48/15'>GEN 48:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/49/24'>49:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/33/7/14'>MIC 7:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/23/1'>PS 23:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/80/1'>80:1</a>."

NABRE,43,10,6,"[4] Figure of speech: John uses a different word for illustrative speech than the ""parable"" of the synoptics, but the idea is similar."
NABRE,43,10,7,"[5] 10:7-10 In <a href='/NABRE/43/10/7'>JHN 10:7-8</a>, the figure is of a gate for the shepherd to come to the sheep; in <a href='/NABRE/43/10/9'>JHN 10:9-10</a>, the figure is of a gate for the sheep to come in and go out."
NABRE,43,10,8,[6] [Before me]: these words are omitted in many good early manuscripts and versions.
NABRE,43,10,16,"[7] Other sheep: the Gentiles, possibly a reference to ""Gods dispersed children"" of <a href='/NABRE/43/11/52'>JHN 11:52</a> destined to be gathered into one, or ""apostolic Christians"" at odds with the community of the beloved disciple."
NABRE,43,10,18,[8] Power to take it up again: contrast the role of the Father as the efficient cause of the resurrection in <a href='/NABRE/44/2/24'>ACT 2:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/4/10'>4:10</a>; etc.; <a href='/NABRE/45/1/4'>ROM 1:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/4/24'>4:24</a>. Yet even here is added: This command I have received from my Father.
NABRE,43,10,22,"[9] Feast of the Dedication: an eight-day festival of lights (Hebrew, Hanukkah) held in December, three months after the feast of Tabernacles (<a href='/NABRE/43/7/2'>JHN 7:2</a>), to celebrate the Maccabees rededication of the altar and reconsecration of the temple in 164 B.C., after their desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes (<a href='/NABRE/27/8/13'>DAN 8:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/9/27'>9:27</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/4/36'>1MA 4:36-59</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/1/18'>2MA 1:18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/75/2/19'>2:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/10/1'>10:1-8</a>)."

If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly: cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/22/67'>LUK 22:67</a>. This is the climax of Jesus encounters with the Jewish authorities. There has never yet been an open confession before them."
NABRE,43,10,25,[12] I told you: probably at <a href='/NABRE/43/8/25'>JHN 8:25</a> which was an evasive answer.
NABRE,43,10,29,"[13] The textual evidence for the first clause is very divided; it may also be translated: ""As for the Father, what he has given me is greater than all,"" or ""My Father is greater than all, in what he has given me."""
NABRE,43,10,30,[14] This is justification for <a href='/NABRE/43/10/29'>JHN 10:29</a>; it asserts unity of power and reveals that the words and deeds of Jesus are the words and deeds of God.
NABRE,43,10,34,"[15] This is a reference to the judges of Israel who, since they exercised the divine prerogative to judge (<a href='/NABRE/5/1/17'>DEU 1:17</a>), were called ""gods""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/21/6'>EXO 21:6</a>, besides <a href='/NABRE/19/82/6'>PS 82:6</a>, from which the quotation comes."
NABRE,43,10,36,[16] Consecrated: this may be a reference to the rededicated altar at the Hanukkah feast; see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/10/22'>JHN 10:22</a>.
NABRE,43,10,41,"[17] Performed no sign: this is to stress the inferior role of John the Baptist. The Transjordan topography recalls the great witness of John the Baptist to Jesus, as opposed to the hostility of the authorities in Jerusalem."
NABRE,43,11,1,"[1] 11:1-44 The raising of Lazarus, the longest continuous narrative in John outside of the passion account, is the climax of the signs. It leads directly to the decision of the Sanhedrin to kill Jesus. The theme of life predominates. Lazarus is a token of the real life that Jesus dead and raised will give to all who believe in him. Johannine irony is found in the fact that Jesus gift of life leads to his own death. The story is not found in the synoptics, but cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/5/21'>MAK 5:21</a> and parallels; <a href='/NABRE/42/7/11'>LUK 7:11-17</a>. There are also parallels between this story and Lukes parable of the rich man and poor Lazarus (<a href='/NABRE/42/16/19'>LUK 16:19-31</a>). In both a man named Lazarus dies; in Luke, there is a request that he return to convince his contemporaries of the need for faith and repentance, while in John, Lazarus does return and some believe but others do not."
NABRE,43,11,4,"[2] Not to end in death: this is misunderstood by the disciples as referring to physical death, but it is meant as spiritual death."
NABRE,43,11,10,[3] The light is not in him: the ancients apparently did not grasp clearly the entry of light throughthe eye; they seem to have thought of it as being inthe eye; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/11/34'>LUK 11:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/6/23'>MAT 6:23</a>.
NABRE,43,11,16,"[4] Called Didymus: Didymusis the Greek word for twin. Thomas is derived from the Aramaic word for twin; in an ancient Syriac version and in the Gospel of Thomas (<a href='/NABRE/43/80/11'>80:11-12</a>) his given name, Judas, is supplied."
NABRE,43,11,18,"[5] About two miles: literally, ""about fifteen stades""; a stade was 607 feet."
NABRE,43,11,27,[6] The titles here are a summary of titles given to Jesus earlier in the gospel.

NABRE,43,11,48,[10] The Romans will come: Johannine irony; this is precisely what happened after Jesus death.
NABRE,43,11,49,"[11] That year: emphasizes the conjunction of the office and the year. Actually, Caiaphas was high priest A.D. 18-36. The Jews attributed a gift of prophecy, sometimes unconscious, to the high priest."

NABRE,43,12,1,[1] 12:1-8 This is probably the same scene of anointing found in <a href='/NABRE/41/14/3'>MAK 14:3-9</a> (see note there) and <a href='/NABRE/40/26/6'>MAT 26:6-13</a>. The anointing by a penitent woman in <a href='/NABRE/42/7/36'>LUK 7:36-38</a> is different. Details from these various episodes have become interchanged.
NABRE,43,12,3,"[2] The feet of Jesus: so <a href='/NABRE/41/14/3'>MAK 14:3</a>; but in <a href='/NABRE/40/26/6'>MAT 26:6</a>, Mary anoints Jesus head as a sign of regal, messianic anointing."

NABRE,43,12,7,"[4] Jesus response reflects the rabbinical discussion of what was the greatest act of mercy, almsgiving or burying the dead. Those who favored proper burial of the dead thought it an essential condition for sharing in the resurrection."
NABRE,43,12,11,"[5] 12:12-19 In John, the entry into Jerusalem follows the anointing whereas in the synoptics it precedes. In John, the crowd, not the disciples, are responsible for the triumphal procession."
NABRE,43,12,13,"[6] Palm branches: used to welcome great conquerors; cf. <a href='/NABRE/74/13/51'>1MA 13:51</a>; <a href='/NABRE/75/10/7'>2MA 10:7</a>. They may be related to the lûlāb, the twig bundles used at the feast of Tabernacles. Hosanna: see <a href='/NABRE/19/118/25'>PS 118:25-26</a>. The Hebrew word means: ""(O Lord), grant salvation."" He who comes in the name of the Lord: referred in <a href='/NABRE/19/118/26'>PS 118:26</a> to a pilgrim entering the temple gates, but here a title for Jesus (see notes on <a href='/NABRE/40/11/3'>MAT 11:3</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/6/14'>JHN 6:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/11/27'>11:27</a>).

NABRE,43,12,15,"[7] Daughter Zion: Jerusalem. Asss colt: symbol of peace, as opposed to the war horse."
NABRE,43,12,16,[8] They had done this: the antecedent of theyis ambiguous.
NABRE,43,12,17,"[9] 12:17-18 There seem to be two different crowds in these verses. There are some good witnesses to the text that have another reading for <a href='/NABRE/43/12/17'>JHN 12:17</a>: ""Then the crowd that was with him began to testify that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead."""
NABRE,43,12,19,"[10] The whole world: the sense is that everyone is following Jesus, but John has an ironic play on world; he alludes to the universality of salvation (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/17'>JHN 3:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/4/42'>4:42</a>)."
NABRE,43,12,19,"[11] 12:20-36 This announcement of glorification by death is an illustration of ""the whole world"" (<a href='/NABRE/43/12/19'>JHN 12:19</a>) going after him."
NABRE,43,12,20,[12] Greeks: not used here in a nationalistic sense. These are probably Gentile proselytes to Judaism; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/7/35'>JHN 7:35</a>.
NABRE,43,12,21,"[13] 12:21-22 Philip…Andrew: the approach is made through disciples who have distinctly Greek names, suggesting that access to Jesus was mediated to the Greek world through his disciples. Philip and Andrew were from Bethsaida (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/44'>JHN 1:44</a>); Galileans were mostly bilingual. See: here seems to mean ""have an interview with."""
NABRE,43,12,23,[14] Jesus response suggests that only after the crucifixion could the gospel encompass both Jew and Gentile.
NABRE,43,12,24,[15] This verse implies that through his death Jesus will be accessible to all. It remains just a grain of wheat: this saying is found in the synoptic triple and double traditions (<a href='/NABRE/41/8/35'>MAK 8:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/16/25'>MAT 16:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/9/24'>LUK 9:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/10/39'>MAT 10:39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/17/33'>LUK 17:33</a>). John adds the phrases (<a href='/NABRE/43/12/25'>JHN 12:25</a>) in this worldand for eternal life.
NABRE,43,12,25,"[16] His life: the Greek word psychērefers to a persons natural life. It does not mean ""soul,"" for Hebrew anthropology did not postulate body/soul dualism in the way that is familiar to us."
NABRE,43,12,27,[17] I am troubled: perhaps an allusion to the Gethsemane agony scene of the synoptics.
NABRE,43,12,31,[18] Ruler of this world: Satan.
NABRE,43,12,34,[19] There is no passage in the Old Testament that states precisely that the Messiah remains forever. Perhaps the closest is <a href='/NABRE/19/89/37'>PS 89:37</a>.
NABRE,43,12,37,"[20] 12:37-50 These verses, on unbelief of the Jews, provide an epilogue to the Book of Signs."
NABRE,43,12,38,"[21] 12:38-41 John gives a historical explanation of the disbelief of the Jewish people, not a psychological one. The Old Testament had to be fulfilled; the disbelief that met Isaiahs message was a foreshadowing of the disbelief that Jesus encountered. In <a href='/NABRE/43/12/42'>JHN 12:42</a> and also in <a href='/NABRE/43/3/20'>JHN 3:20</a> we see that there is no negation of freedom."
NABRE,43,12,41,"[22] His glory: Isaiah saw the glory of Yahweh enthroned in the heavenly temple, but in John the antecedent of hisis Jesus."
NABRE,43,13,1,"[1] 13:1-19:42 The Book of Glory. There is a major break here; the word ""sign"" is used again only in <a href='/NABRE/43/20/30'>JHN 20:30</a>. In this phase of Jesus return to the Father, the discourses (<a href='/NABRE/43/13/1'>JHN 13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/43/17/1'>17</a>) precede the traditional narrative of the passion (<a href='/NABRE/43/18/1'>JHN 18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/43/20/1'>20</a>) to interpret them for the Christian reader. This is the only extended example of esoteric teaching of disciples in John."
NABRE,43,13,1,"[2] 13:1-20 Washing of the disciples feet. This episode occurs in John at the place of the narration of the institution of the Eucharist in the synoptics. It may be a dramatization of <a href='/NABRE/42/22/27'>LUK 22:27</a>—""I am your servant."" It is presented as a ""model"" (""pattern"") of the crucifixion. It symbolizes cleansing from sin by sacrificial death."
NABRE,43,13,1,"[3] Before the feast of Passover: this would be Thursday evening, before the day of preparation; in the synoptics, the Last Supper is a Passover meal taking place, in Johns chronology, on Friday evening. To the end: or, ""completely."""
NABRE,43,13,2,"[4] Induced: literally, ""The devil put into the heart that Judas should hand him over."""
NABRE,43,13,5,[5] The act of washing anothers feet was one that could not be required of the lowliest Jewish slave. It is an allusion to the humiliating death of the crucifixion.
NABRE,43,13,10,[6] Bathed: many have suggested that this passage is a symbolic reference to baptism. The Greek root involved is used in baptismal contexts in <a href='/NABRE/46/6/11'>1CO 6:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/5/26'>EPH 5:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/56/3/5'>TIT 3:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/10/22'>HEB 10:22</a>.
NABRE,43,13,16,"[7] Messenger: the Greek has apostolos, the only occurrence of the term in John. It is not used in the technical sense here."

A disciple, called ""another disciple"" or ""the other disciple,"" is mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/43/18/15'>JHN 18:15</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/20/2'>JHN 20:2</a>; in the latter reference he is identified with the disciple whom Jesus loved. There is also an unnamed disciple in <a href='/NABRE/43/1/35'>JHN 1:35-40</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/37'>JHN 1:37</a>."
NABRE,43,13,26,[9] Morsel: probably the bitter herb dipped in salt water.
NABRE,43,13,31,"[10] 13:31-17:26 Two farewell discourses and a prayer. These seem to be Johannine compositions, including sayings of Jesus at the Last Supper and on other occasions, modeled on similar farewell discourses in Greek literature and the Old Testament (of Moses, Joshua, David)."
NABRE,43,13,31,"[11] 13:31-38 Introduction: departure and return. Terms of coming and going predominate. These verses form an introduction to the last discourse of Jesus, which extends through <a href='/NABRE/43/14/1'>JHN 14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/43/17/1'>17</a>. In it John has collected Jesus words to his own (<a href='/NABRE/43/13/1'>JHN 13:1</a>). There are indications that several speeches have been fused together, e.g., in <a href='/NABRE/43/14/31'>JHN 14:31</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/17/1'>JHN 17:1</a>."
NABRE,43,13,34,[12] I give you a new commandment: this puts Jesus on a par with Yahweh. The commandment itself is not new; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/19/18'>LEV 19:18</a> and the note there.
NABRE,43,14,1,"[1] 14:1-31 Jesus departure and return. This section is a dialogue marked off by a literary inclusion in <a href='/NABRE/43/14/1'>JHN 14:1, 27</a>: ""Do not let your hearts be troubled."""
NABRE,43,14,1,"[2] You have faith: could also be imperative: ""Have faith."""
NABRE,43,14,3,[3] Come back again: a rare Johannine reference to the parousia; cf. <a href='/NABRE/62/2/28'>1JN 2:28</a>.
NABRE,43,14,4,"[4] The way: here, of Jesus himself; also a designation of Christianity in <a href='/NABRE/44/9/2'>ACT 9:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/19/9'>19:9, 23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/4'>22:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/24/14'>24:14, 22</a>."
NABRE,43,14,6,"[5] The truth: in John, the divinely revealed reality of the Father manifested in the person and works of Jesus. The possession of truth confers knowledge and liberation from sin (<a href='/NABRE/43/8/32'>JHN 8:32</a>)."
NABRE,43,14,7,"[6] An alternative reading, ""If you knew me, then you would have known my Father also,"" would be a rebuke, as in <a href='/NABRE/43/8/19'>JHN 8:19</a>."
NABRE,43,14,8,[7] Show us the Father: Philip is pictured asking for a theophany like <a href='/NABRE/2/24/9'>EXO 24:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/33/18'>33:18</a>.
NABRE,43,14,16,"[8] Another Advocate: Jesus is the first advocate (paraclete); see <a href='/NABRE/62/2/1'>1JN 2:1</a>, where Jesus is an advocate in the sense of intercessor in heaven. The Greek term derives from legal terminology for an advocate or defense attorney, and can mean spokesman, mediator, intercessor, comforter, consoler, although no one of these terms encompasses the meaning in John. The Paraclete in John is a teacher, a witness to Jesus, and a prosecutor of the world, who represents the continued presence on earth of the Jesus who has returned to the Father."
NABRE,43,14,17,"[9] The Spirit of truth: this term is also used at Qumran, where it is a moral force put into a person by God, as opposed to the spirit of perversity. It is more personal in John; it will teach the realities of the new order (<a href='/NABRE/43/14/26'>JHN 14:26</a>), and testify to the truth (<a href='/NABRE/43/14/6'>JHN 14:6</a>). While it has been customary to use masculine personal pronouns in English for the Advocate, the Greek word for ""spirit"" is neuter, and the Greek text and manuscript variants fluctuate between masculine and neuter pronouns."
NABRE,43,14,18,"[10] I will come to you: indwelling, not parousia."
NABRE,43,14,22,"[11] Judas, not the Iscariot: probably not the brother of Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/41/6/3'>MAK 6:3</a> || <a href='/NABRE/40/13/55'>MAT 13:55</a> or the apostle named Jude in <a href='/NABRE/42/6/16'>LUK 6:16</a>, but Thomas (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/11/16'>JHN 11:16</a>), although other readings have ""Judas the Cananean."""
NABRE,43,14,27,"[12] Peace: the traditional Hebrew salutation šālôm; but Jesus ""Shalom"" is a gift of salvation, connoting the bounty of messianic blessing."
NABRE,43,14,28,"[13] The Father is greater than I: because he sent, gave, etc., and Jesus is ""a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God"" (<a href='/NABRE/43/8/40'>JHN 8:40</a>)."

NABRE,43,15,1,[1] 15:1-16:4 Discourse on the union of Jesus with his disciples. His words become a monologue and go beyond the immediate crisis of the departure of Jesus.
NABRE,43,15,1,"[2] 15:1-17 Like <a href='/NABRE/43/10/1'>JHN 10:1-5</a>, this passage resembles a parable. Israel is spoken of as a vineyard at <a href='/NABRE/23/5/1'>ISA 5:1-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/21/33'>MAT 21:33-46</a> and as a vine at <a href='/NABRE/19/80/9'>PS 80:9-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/2/21'>JER 2:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/15/2'>EZE 15:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/17/5'>17:5-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/19/10'>19:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/10/1'>HOS 10:1</a>. The identification of the vine as the Son of Man in <a href='/NABRE/19/80/15'>PS 80:15</a> and Wisdoms description of herself as a vine in <a href='/NABRE/71/24/17'>SIR 24:17</a> are further background for portrayal of Jesus by this figure. There may be secondary eucharistic symbolism here; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/25'>MAK 14:25</a>, ""the fruit of the vine."""
NABRE,43,15,2,[3] Takes away…prunes: in Greek there is a play on two related verbs.
NABRE,43,15,6,[4] Branches were cut off and dried on the wall of the vineyard for later use as fuel.
NABRE,43,15,13,"[5] For ones friends: or: ""those whom one loves."" In <a href='/NABRE/43/15/9'>JHN 15:9-13</a>a, the words for love are related to the Greek agapaō. In <a href='/NABRE/43/15/13'>JHN 15:13</a>b-15, the words for love are related to the Greek phileō. For John, the two roots seem synonymous and mean ""to love""; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/43/21/15'>JHN 21:15-17</a>. The word philosis used here."
NABRE,43,15,15,"[6] Slaves…friends: in the Old Testament, Moses (<a href='/NABRE/5/34/5'>DEU 34:5</a>), Joshua (<a href='/NABRE/6/24/29'>JOS 24:29</a>), and David (<a href='/NABRE/19/89/21'>PS 89:21</a>) were called ""servants"" or ""slaves of Yahweh""; only Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/23/41/8'>ISA 41:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/14/20/7'>2CH 20:7</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/59/2/23'>JAM 2:23</a>) was called a ""friend of God."""
NABRE,43,15,17,"[7] 15:18-16:4 The hostile reaction of the world. There are synoptic parallels, predicting persecution, especially at <a href='/NABRE/40/10/17'>MAT 10:17-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/9'>24:9-10</a>."
NABRE,43,15,20,[8] The word I spoke to you: a reference to <a href='/NABRE/43/13/16'>JHN 13:16</a>.
NABRE,43,15,21,"[9] On account of my name: the idea of persecution for Jesus name is frequent in the New Testament (<a href='/NABRE/40/10/22'>MAT 10:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/24/9'>24:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/9/14'>ACT 9:14</a>). For John, association with Jesus name implies union with Jesus."
NABRE,43,15,22,"[10] 15:22, 24 Jesus words (spoken) and deeds (works) are the great motives of credibility. They have seen and hated: probably means that they have seen his works and still have hated; but the Greek can be read: ""have seen both me and my Father and still have hated both me and my Father."" Works…that no one else ever did: so Yahweh in <a href='/NABRE/5/4/32'>DEU 4:32-33</a>."
NABRE,43,15,25,"[11] In their law: law is here used as a larger concept than the Pentateuch, for the reference is to <a href='/NABRE/19/35/19'>PS 35:19</a> or <a href='/NABRE/19/69/5'>PS 69:5</a>. See notes on <a href='/NABRE/43/10/34'>JHN 10:34</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/12/34'>12:34</a>. Theirlaw reflects the argument of the church with the synagogue."
NABRE,43,15,26,"[12] Whom I will send: in <a href='/NABRE/43/14/16'>JHN 14:16, 26</a>, the Paraclete is to be sent by the Father, at the request of Jesus. Here the Spirit comes from both Jesus and the Father in mission; there is no reference here to the eternal procession of the Spirit."
NABRE,43,16,2,"[1] Hour: of persecution, not Jesus ""hour"" (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/2/4'>JHN 2:4</a>)."
NABRE,43,16,4,[2] 16:4b-33 A duplicate of <a href='/NABRE/43/14/1'>JHN 14:1-31</a> on departure and return.
NABRE,43,16,5,[3] Not one of you asks me: the difficulty of reconciling this with Simon Peters question in <a href='/NABRE/43/13/36'>JHN 13:36</a> and Thomas words in <a href='/NABRE/43/14/5'>JHN 14:5</a> strengthens the supposition that the last discourse has been made up of several collections of Johannine material.
NABRE,43,16,8,"[4] 16:8-11 These verses illustrate the forensic character of the Paracletes role: in the forum of the disciples conscience he prosecutes the world. He leads believers to see (a) that the basic sin was and is refusal to believe in Jesus; (b) that, although Jesus was found guilty and apparently died in disgrace, in reality righteousness has triumphed, for Jesus has returned to his Father; (c) finally, that it is the ruler of this world, Satan, who has been condemned through Jesus death (<a href='/NABRE/43/12/32'>JHN 12:32</a>)."
NABRE,43,16,13,"[5] Declare to you the things that are coming: not a reference to new predictions about the future, but interpretation of what has already occurred or been said."
NABRE,43,16,25,"[6] See note on <a href='/NABRE/43/10/6'>JHN 10:6</a>. Here, possibly a reference to <a href='/NABRE/43/15/1'>JHN 15:1-16</a> or <a href='/NABRE/43/16/21'>JHN 16:21</a>."
NABRE,43,16,30,"[7] The reference is seemingly to the fact that Jesus could anticipate their question in <a href='/NABRE/43/16/19'>JHN 16:19</a>. The disciples naively think they have the full understanding that is the climax of ""the hour"" of Jesus death, resurrection, and ascension (<a href='/NABRE/43/16/25'>JHN 16:25</a>), but the only part of the hour that is at hand for them is their share in the passion (<a href='/NABRE/43/16/32'>JHN 16:32</a>)."
NABRE,43,16,32,"[8] You will be scattered: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/27'>MAK 14:27</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/26/31'>MAT 26:31</a>, where both cite <a href='/NABRE/38/13/7'>ZEC 13:7</a> about the sheep being dispersed."
NABRE,43,17,1,"[1] 17:1-26 Climax of the last discourse(s). Since the sixteenth century, this chapter has been called the ""high priestly prayer"" of Jesus. He speaks as intercessor, with words addressed directly to the Father and not to the disciples, who supposedly only overhear. Yet the prayer is one of petition, for immediate (<a href='/NABRE/43/17/6'>JHN 17:6-19</a>) and future (<a href='/NABRE/43/17/20'>JHN 17:20-21</a>) disciples. Many phrases reminiscent of the Lords Prayer occur. Although still in the world (<a href='/NABRE/43/17/13'>JHN 17:13</a>), Jesus looks on his earthly ministry as a thing of the past (<a href='/NABRE/43/17/4'>JHN 17:4, 12</a>). Whereas Jesus has up to this time stated that the disciples could follow him (<a href='/NABRE/43/13/33'>JHN 13:33, 36</a>), now he wishes them to be with him in union with the Father (<a href='/NABRE/43/17/12'>JHN 17:12-14</a>)."
NABRE,43,17,1,[2] The action of looking up to heaven and the address Father are typical of Jesus at prayer; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/11/41'>JHN 11:41</a> and <a href='/NABRE/42/11/2'>LUK 11:2</a>.
NABRE,43,17,2,"[3] Another possible interpretation is to treat the first line of the verse as parenthetical and the second as an appositive to the clause that ends v 1: so that your son may glorify you (just as…all people), so that he may give eternal life…."
NABRE,43,17,3,[4] This verse was clearly added in the editing of the gospel as a reflection on the preceding verse; Jesus nowhere else refers to himself as Jesus Christ.
NABRE,43,17,6,"[5] I revealed your name: perhaps the name I AM; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/8/24'>JHN 8:24, 28</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/8/58'>58</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/13/19'>13:19</a>."
NABRE,43,17,15,"[6] Note the resemblance to the petition of the Lords Prayer, ""deliver us from the evil one."" Both probably refer to the devil rather than to abstract evil."
NABRE,43,17,24,[7] Where I am: Jesus prays for the believers ultimately to join him in heaven. Then they will not see his glory as in a mirror but clearly (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/18'>2CO 3:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/3/2'>1JN 3:2</a>).
NABRE,43,17,26,[8] I will make it known: through the Advocate.
NABRE,43,18,1,"[1] 18:1-14 John does not mention the agony in the garden and the kiss of Judas, nor does he identify the place as Gethsemane or the Mount of Olives."
NABRE,43,18,1,"[2] Jesus went out: see <a href='/NABRE/43/14/31'>JHN 14:31</a>, where it seems he is leaving the supper room. Kidron valley: literally, ""the winter-flowing Kidron""; this wadi has water only during the winter rains."
NABRE,43,18,3,"[3] Band of soldiers: seems to refer to Roman troops, either the full cohort of 600 men (1/10 of a legion), or more likely the maniple of 200 under their tribune (<a href='/NABRE/43/18/12'>JHN 18:12</a>). In this case, John is hinting at Roman collusion in the action against Jesus before he was brought to Pilate. The lanterns and torches may be symbolic of the hour of darkness."
NABRE,43,18,5,"[4] Nazorean: the form found in <a href='/NABRE/40/26/71'>MAT 26:71</a> (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/2/23'>MAT 2:23</a>) is here used, not Nazareneof Mark. I AM: or ""I am he,"" but probably intended by the evangelist as an expression of divinity (cf. their appropriate response in <a href='/NABRE/43/18/6'>JHN 18:6</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/8/24'>JHN 8:24</a>. John sets the confusion of the arresting party against the background of Jesus divine majesty."

NABRE,43,18,10,[6] Only John gives the names of the two antagonists; both John and Luke mention the right ear.

NABRE,43,18,13,"[8] Annas: only John mentions an inquiry before Annas; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/18/16'>JHN 18:16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/18/19'>19-24</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/3/2'>LUK 3:2</a>. It is unlikely that this nighttime interrogation before Annas is the same as the trial before Caiaphas placed by Matthew and Mark at night and by Luke in the morning."
NABRE,43,18,15,[9] 18:15-16 Another disciple…the other disciple: see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/13/23'>JHN 13:23</a>.
NABRE,43,18,20,[10] I have always taught…in the temple area: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/49'>MAK 14:49</a> for a similar statement.
NABRE,43,18,24,"[11] Caiaphas: see <a href='/NABRE/40/26/3'>MAT 26:3, 57</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/3/2'>LUK 3:2</a>; and the notes there. John may leave room here for the trial before Caiaphas described in the synoptic gospels."
NABRE,43,18,27,"[12] Cockcrow was the third Roman division of the night, lasting from midnight to 3 a.m."
NABRE,43,18,28,"[13] Praetorium: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/27'>MAT 27:27</a>. Morning: literally, ""the early hour,"" or fourth Roman division of the night, 3 to 6 a.m. The Passover: the synoptic gospels give the impression that the Thursday night supper was the Passover meal (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/12'>MAK 14:12</a>); for John that meal is still to be eaten Friday night."
NABRE,43,18,31,[14] We do not have the right to execute anyone: only John gives this reason for their bringing Jesus to Pilate. Jewish sources are not clear on the competence of the Sanhedrin at this period to sentence and to execute for political crimes.
NABRE,43,18,32,"[15] The Jewish punishment for blasphemy was stoning (<a href='/NABRE/3/24/16'>LEV 24:16</a>). In coming to the Romans to ensure that Jesus would be crucified, the Jewish authorities fulfilled his prophecy that he would be exalted (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/14'>JHN 3:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/12/32'>12:32-33</a>). There is some historical evidence, however, for Jews crucifying Jews."
NABRE,43,18,37,[16] You say I am a king: see <a href='/NABRE/40/26/64'>MAT 26:64</a> for a similar response to the high priest. It is at best a reluctant affirmative.
NABRE,43,18,39,[17] See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/15'>MAT 27:15</a>.
NABRE,43,18,40,"[18] Barabbas: see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/16'>MAT 27:16-17</a>. Revolutionary: a guerrilla warrior fighting for nationalistic aims, though the term can also denote a robber. See note on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/38'>MAT 27:38</a>."
NABRE,43,19,1,[1] Luke places the mockery of Jesus at the midpoint in the trial when Jesus was sent to Herod. Mark and Matthew place the scourging and mockery at the end of the trial after the sentence of death. Scourging was an integral part of the crucifixion penalty.
NABRE,43,19,7,"[2] Made himself the Son of God: this question was not raised in Johns account of the Jewish interrogations of Jesus as it was in the synoptic account. Nevertheless, see <a href='/NABRE/43/5/18'>JHN 5:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/8/53'>8:53</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/10/36'>10:36</a>."
NABRE,43,19,12,[3] Friend of Caesar: a Roman honorific title bestowed upon high-ranking officials for merit.
NABRE,43,19,13,"[4] Seated him: others translate ""(Pilate) sat down."" In Johns thought, Jesus is the real judge of the world, and John may here be portraying him seated on the judgment bench. Stone pavement: in Greek lithostrotos; under the fortress Antonia, one of the conjectured locations of the praetorium, a massive stone pavement has been excavated. Gabbatha(Aramaic rather than Hebrew) probably means ""ridge, elevation."""
NABRE,43,19,14,"[5] Noon: <a href='/NABRE/41/15/25'>MAK 15:25</a> has Jesus crucified ""at the third hour,"" which means either 9 a.m. or the period from 9 to 12 noon, the time when, according to John, Jesus was sentenced to death, was the hour at which the priests began to slaughter Passover lambs in the temple; see <a href='/NABRE/43/1/29'>JHN 1:29</a>."
NABRE,43,19,16,"[6] He handed him over to them to be crucified: in context this would seem to mean ""handed him over to the chief priests."" <a href='/NABRE/42/23/25'>LUK 23:25</a> has a similar ambiguity. There is a polemic tendency in the gospels to place the guilt of the crucifixion on the Jewish authorities and to exonerate the Romans from blame. But John later mentions the Roman soldiers (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/23'>JHN 19:23</a>), and it was to these soldiers that Pilate handed Jesus over."
NABRE,43,19,17,"[7] Carrying the cross himself: a different picture from that of the synoptics, especially <a href='/NABRE/42/23/26'>LUK 23:26</a>, where Simon of Cyrene is made to carry the cross, walking behind Jesus. In Johns theology, Jesus remained in complete control and master of his destiny (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/10/18'>JHN 10:18</a>). Place of the Skull: the Latin word for skull is Calvaria; hence ""Calvary."" Golgothais actually an Aramaic rather than a Hebrew word."
NABRE,43,19,19,[8] The inscription differs with slightly different words in each of the four gospels. Johns form is fullest and gives the equivalent of the Latin INRI= Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum. Only John mentions its polyglot character (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/20'>JHN 19:20</a>) and Pilates role in keeping the title unchanged (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/21'>JHN 19:21-22</a>).
NABRE,43,19,23,"[9] 19:23-25a While all four gospels describe the soldiers casting lots to divide Jesus garments (see note on <a href='/NABRE/40/27/35'>MAT 27:35</a>), only John quotes the underlying passage from <a href='/NABRE/19/22/19'>PS 22:19</a>, and only John sees each line of the poetic parallelism literally carried out in two separate actions (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/23'>JHN 19:23-24</a>)."
NABRE,43,19,25,"[10] It is not clear whether four women are meant, or three (i.e., Mary the wife of Cl[e]opas[cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/24/18'>LUK 24:18</a>] is in apposition with his mothers sister) or two (his mother and his mothers sister, i.e., Mary of Cl[e]opas and Mary of Magdala). Only John mentions the mother of Jesus here. The synoptics have a group of women looking on from a distance at the cross (<a href='/NABRE/41/15/40'>MAK 15:40</a>)."
NABRE,43,19,26,"[11] 19:26-27 This scene has been interpreted literally, of Jesus concern for his mother; and symbolically, e.g., in the light of the Cana story in <a href='/NABRE/43/2/1'>JHN 2</a> (the presence of the mother of Jesus, the address woman, and the mention of the hour) and of the upper room in <a href='/NABRE/43/13/1'>JHN 13</a> (the presence of the beloved disciple; the hour). Now that the hour has come (<a href='/NABRE/43/19/28'>JHN 19:28</a>), Mary (a symbol of the church?) is given a role as the mother of Christians (personified by the beloved disciple); or, as a representative of those seeking salvation, she is supported by the disciple who interprets Jesus revelation; or Jewish and Gentile Christianity (or Israel and the Christian community) are reconciled."
NABRE,43,19,28,"[12] The scripture…fulfilled: either in the scene of <a href='/NABRE/43/19/25'>JHN 19:25-27</a>, or in the I thirstof <a href='/NABRE/43/19/28'>JHN 19:28</a>. If the latter, <a href='/NABRE/19/22/16'>PS 22:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/69/22'>69:22</a> deserve consideration."
NABRE,43,19,29,"[13] Wine: John does not mention the drugged wine, a narcotic that Jesus refused as the crucifixion began (<a href='/NABRE/41/15/23'>MAK 15:23</a>), but only this final gesture of kindness at the end (<a href='/NABRE/41/15/36'>MAK 15:36</a>). Hyssop, a small plant, is scarcely suitable for carrying a sponge (Mark mentions a reed) and may be a symbolic reference to the hyssop used to daub the blood of the paschal lamb on the doorpost of the Hebrews (<a href='/NABRE/2/12/22'>EXO 12:22</a>)."
NABRE,43,19,30,"[14] Handed over the spirit: there is a double nuance of dying (giving up the last breath or spirit) and that of passing on the holy Spirit; see <a href='/NABRE/43/7/39'>JHN 7:39</a>, which connects the giving of the Spirit with Jesus glorious return to the Father, and <a href='/NABRE/43/20/22'>JHN 20:22</a>, where the author portrays the conferral of the Spirit."
NABRE,43,19,34,"[15] 19:34-35 John probably emphasizes these verses to show the reality of Jesus death, against the docetic heretics. In the blood and water there may also be a symbolic reference to the Eucharist and baptism."
NABRE,43,19,35,[16] He knows: it is not certain from the Greek that this heis the eyewitnessof the first part of the sentence. May [come to] believe: see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/20/31'>JHN 20:31</a>.
NABRE,43,19,37,[17] 19:38-42 In the first three gospels there is no anointing on Friday. In Matthew and Luke the women come to the tomb on Sunday morning precisely to anoint Jesus.
NABRE,43,20,1,[1] 20:1-10 The story of the empty tomb is found in both the Matthean and the Lucan traditions; Johns version seems to be a fusion of the two.
NABRE,43,20,1,"[2] Still dark: according to Mark the sun had risen, Matthew describes it as ""dawning,"" and Luke refers to early dawn. Mary sees the stone removed, not the empty tomb."
NABRE,43,20,2,"[3] Mary runs away, not directed by an angel/young man as in the synoptic accounts. The plural ""we"" in the second part of her statement might reflect a tradition of more women going to the tomb."
NABRE,43,20,3,"[4] 20:3-10 The basic narrative is told of Peter alone in <a href='/NABRE/42/24/12'>LUK 24:12</a>, a verse missing in important manuscripts and which may be borrowed from tradition similar to John. Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/42/24/24'>LUK 24:24</a>."
NABRE,43,20,6,[5] 20:6-8 Some special feature about the state of the burial cloths caused the beloved disciple to believe. Perhaps the details emphasized that the grave had not been robbed.
NABRE,43,20,9,"[6] Probably a general reference to the scriptures is intended, as in <a href='/NABRE/42/24/26'>LUK 24:26</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/15/4'>1CO 15:4</a>. Some individual Old Testament passages suggested are <a href='/NABRE/19/16/10'>PS 16:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/28/6/2'>HOS 6:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/32/2/1'>JON 2:1, 2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/32/2/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,43,20,10,"[7] 20:11-18 This appearance to Mary is found only in John, but cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/28/8'>MAT 28:8-10</a> and <a href='/NABRE/41/16/9'>MAK 16:9-11</a>."
NABRE,43,20,16,"[8] Rabbouni: Hebrew or Aramaic for ""my master."""
NABRE,43,20,17,"[9] Stop holding on to me: see <a href='/NABRE/40/28/9'>MAT 28:9</a>, where the women take hold of his feet. I have not yet ascended: for John and many of the New Testament writers, the ascension in the theological sense of going to the Father to be glorified took place with the resurrection as one action. This scene in John dramatizes such an understanding, for by Easter night Jesus is glorified and can give the Spirit. Therefore his ascension takes place immediately after he has talked to Mary. In such a view, the ascension after forty days described in <a href='/NABRE/44/1/1'>ACT 1:1-11</a> would be simply a termination of earthly appearances or, perhaps better, an introduction to the conferral of the Spirit upon the early church, modeled on Elishas being able to have a (double) share in the spirit of Elijah if he saw him being taken up (same verb as ascending) into heaven (<a href='/NABRE/12/2/9'>2KG 2:9-12</a>). To my Father and your Father, to my God and your God: this echoes <a href='/NABRE/8/1/16'>RUT 1:16</a>: ""Your people shall be my people, and your God my God."" The Father of Jesus will now become the Father of the disciples because, once ascended, Jesus can give them the Spirit that comes from the Father and they can be reborn as Gods children (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/5'>JHN 3:5</a>). That is why he calls them my brothers."
NABRE,43,20,18,"[10] 20:19-29 The appearances to the disciples, without or with Thomas (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/11/16'>JHN 11:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/14/5'>14:5</a>), have rough parallels in the other gospels only for <a href='/NABRE/43/20/19'>JHN 20:19-23</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/24/36'>LUK 24:36-39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/16/14'>MAK 16:14-18</a>."
NABRE,43,20,19,"[11] The disciples: by implication from <a href='/NABRE/43/20/24'>JHN 20:24</a> this means ten of the Twelve, presumably in Jerusalem. Peace be with you: although this could be an ordinary greeting, John intends here to echo <a href='/NABRE/43/14/27'>JHN 14:27</a>. The theme of rejoicing in <a href='/NABRE/43/20/20'>JHN 20:20</a> echoes <a href='/NABRE/43/16/22'>JHN 16:22</a>."
NABRE,43,20,20,"[12] Hands and…side: <a href='/NABRE/42/24/39'>LUK 24:39-40</a> mentions ""hands and feet,"" based on <a href='/NABRE/19/22/17'>PS 22:17</a>."
NABRE,43,20,21,"[13] By means of this sending, the Eleven were made apostles, that is, ""those sent"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/17/18'>JHN 17:18</a>), though John does not use the noun in reference to them (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/13/16'>JHN 13:16</a>). A solemn mission or ""sending"" is also the subject of the post-resurrection appearances to the Eleven in <a href='/NABRE/40/28/19'>MAT 28:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/47'>LUK 24:47</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/16/15'>MAK 16:15</a>."
NABRE,43,20,22,"[14] This action recalls <a href='/NABRE/1/2/7'>GEN 2:7</a>, where God breathed on the first man and gave him life; just as Adams life came from God, so now the disciples new spiritual life comes from Jesus. Cf. also the revivification of the dry bones in <a href='/NABRE/26/37/1'>EZE 37</a>. This is the authors version of Pentecost. Cf. also the note on <a href='/NABRE/43/19/30'>JHN 19:30</a>."
NABRE,43,20,23,[15] The Council of Trent defined that this power to forgive sins is exercised in the sacrament of penance. See <a href='/NABRE/40/16/19'>MAT 16:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/18/18'>18:18</a>.
NABRE,43,20,28,"[16] My Lord and my God: this forms a literary inclusion with the first verse of the gospel: ""and the Word was God."""
NABRE,43,20,29,"[17] This verse is a beatitude on future generations; faith, not sight, matters."
NABRE,43,20,29,"[18] 20:30-31 These verses are clearly a conclusion to the gospel and express its purpose. While many manuscripts read come to believe, possibly implying a missionary purpose for Johns gospel, a small number of quite early ones read ""continue to believe,"" suggesting that the audience consists of Christians whose faith is to be deepened by the book; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/19/35'>JHN 19:35</a>."
NABRE,43,21,1,"[1] 21:1-23 There are many non-Johannine peculiarities in this chapter, some suggesting Lucan Greek style; yet this passage is closer to John than <a href='/NABRE/43/7/53'>JHN 7:53</a>-<a href='/NABRE/43/8/11'>8:11</a>. There are many Johannine features as well. Its closest parallels in the synoptic gospels are found in <a href='/NABRE/42/5/1'>LUK 5:1-11</a> and <a href='/NABRE/40/14/28'>MAT 14:28-31</a>. Perhaps the tradition was ultimately derived from John but preserved by some disciple other than the writer of the rest of the gospel. The appearances narrated seem to be independent of those in <a href='/NABRE/43/20/1'>JHN 20</a>. Even if a later addition, the chapter was added before publication of the gospel, for it appears in all manuscripts."
NABRE,43,21,2,"[2] Zebedees sons: the only reference to James and John in this gospel (but see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/1/37'>JHN 1:37</a>). Perhaps the phrase was originally a gloss to identify, among the five, the two others of his disciples. The anonymity of the latter phrase is more Johannine (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/35'>JHN 1:35</a>). The total of seven may suggest the community of the disciples in its fullness."
NABRE,43,21,3,[3] 21:3-6 This may be a variant of Lukes account of the catch of fish; see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/5/1'>LUK 5:1-11</a>.
NABRE,43,21,9,"[4] 21:9, 12-13 It is strange that Jesus already has fish since none have yet been brought ashore. This meal may have had eucharistic significance for early Christians since <a href='/NABRE/43/21/13'>JHN 21:13</a> recalls <a href='/NABRE/43/6/11'>JHN 6:11</a> which uses the vocabulary of Jesus action at the Last Supper; but see also note on <a href='/NABRE/40/14/19'>MAT 14:19</a>."
NABRE,43,21,11,[5] The exact number 153 is probably meant to have a symbolic meaning in relation to the apostles universal mission; Jerome claims that Greek zoologists catalogued 153 species of fish. Or 153 is the sum of the numbers from 1 to 17. Others invoke <a href='/NABRE/26/47/10'>EZE 47:10</a>.
NABRE,43,21,12,"[6] None…dared to ask him: is Jesus appearance strange to them? Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/24/16'>LUK 24:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/16/12'>MAK 16:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/20/14'>JHN 20:14</a>. The disciples do, however, recognize Jesus beforethe breaking of the bread (opposed to <a href='/NABRE/42/24/35'>LUK 24:35</a>)."
NABRE,43,21,14,"[7] This verse connects <a href='/NABRE/43/20/1'>JHN 20</a> and <a href='/NABRE/43/20/21'>21</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/20/19'>JHN 20:19, 26</a>."
NABRE,43,21,14,[8] 21:15-23 This section constitutes Peters rehabilitation and emphasizes his role in the church.
NABRE,43,21,15,"[9] 21:15-17 In these three verses there is a remarkable variety of synonyms: two different Greek verbs for love(see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/15/13'>JHN 15:13</a>); two verbs for feed/tend; two nouns for sheep; two verbs for know. But apparently there is no difference of meaning. The threefold confession of Peter is meant to counteract his earlier threefold denial (<a href='/NABRE/43/18/17'>JHN 18:17, 25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/43/18/27'>27</a>). The First Vatican Council cited these verses in defining that Jesus after his resurrection gave Peter the jurisdiction of supreme shepherd and ruler over the whole flock."
NABRE,43,21,15,"[10] More than these: probably ""more than these disciples do"" rather than ""more than you love them"" or ""more than you love these things [fishing, etc.]."""
NABRE,43,21,18,"[11] Originally probably a proverb about old age, now used as a figurative reference to the crucifixion of Peter."
NABRE,43,21,22,[12] Until I come: a reference to the parousia.
NABRE,43,21,23,[13] This whole scene takes on more significance if the disciple is already dead. The death of the apostolic generation caused problems in the church because of a belief that Jesus was to have returned first. Loss of faith sometimes resulted; cf. <a href='/NABRE/61/3/4'>2PE 3:4</a>.
NABRE,43,21,24,"[14] Who…has written them: this does not necessarily mean he wrote them with his own hand. The same expression is used in <a href='/NABRE/43/19/22'>JHN 19:22</a> of Pilate, who certainly would not have written the inscription himself. We know: i.e., the Christian community; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/14'>JHN 1:14, 16</a>."
NABRE,44,1,3,"[1] Appearing to them during forty days: Luke considered especially sacred the interval in which the appearances and instructions of the risen Jesus occurred and expressed it therefore in terms of the sacred number forty (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/8/2'>DEU 8:2</a>). In his gospel, however, Luke connects the ascension of Jesus with the resurrection by describing the ascension on Easter Sunday evening (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/50'>LUK 24:50-53</a>). What should probably be understood as one event (resurrection, glorification, ascension, sending of the Spirit—the paschal mystery) has been historicized by Luke when he writes of a visible ascension of Jesus after forty days and the descent of the Spirit at Pentecost. For Luke, the ascension marks the end of the appearances of Jesus except for the extraordinary appearance to Paul. With regard to Lukes understanding of salvation history, the ascension also marks the end of the time of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/50'>LUK 24:50-53</a>) and signals the beginning of the time of the church."
NABRE,44,1,4,"[2] The promise of the Father: the holy Spirit, as is clear from the next verse. This gift of the Spirit was first promised in Jesus final instructions to his chosen witnesses in Lukes gospel (<a href='/NABRE/42/24/49'>LUK 24:49</a>) and formed part of the continuing instructions of the risen Jesus on the kingdom of God, of which Luke speaks in <a href='/NABRE/44/1/3'>ACT 1:3</a>."
NABRE,44,1,6,"[3] The question of the disciples implies that in believing Jesus to be the Christ (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/2/11'>LUK 2:11</a>) they had expected him to be a political leader who would restore self-rule to Israel during his historical ministry. When this had not taken place, they ask if it is to take place at this time, the period of the church."
NABRE,44,1,7,[4] This verse echoes the tradition that the precise time of the parousia is not revealed to human beings; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/13/32'>MAK 13:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/5/1'>1TS 5:1-3</a>.
NABRE,44,1,8,"[5] Just as Jerusalem was the city of destiny in the Gospel of Luke (the place where salvation was accomplished), so here at the beginning of Acts, Jerusalem occupies a central position. It is the starting point for the mission of the Christian disciples to ""the ends of the earth,"" the place where the apostles were situated and the doctrinal focal point in the early days of the community (<a href='/NABRE/44/15/2'>ACT 15:2, 6</a>). The ends of the earth: for Luke, this means Rome."
NABRE,44,1,18,"[6] Luke records a popular tradition about the death of Judas that differs from the one in <a href='/NABRE/40/27/5'>MAT 27:5</a>, according to which Judas hanged himself. Here, although the text is not certain, Judas is depicted as purchasing a piece of property with the betrayal money and being killed on it in a fall."
NABRE,44,1,26,"[7] The need to replace Judas was probably dictated by the symbolism of the number twelve, recalling the twelve tribes of Israel. This symbolism also indicates that for Luke (see <a href='/NABRE/42/22/30'>LUK 22:30</a>) the Christian church is a reconstituted Israel."
NABRE,44,2,1,"[1] 2:1-41 Lukes pentecostal narrative consists of an introduction (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/1'>ACT 2:1-13</a>), a speech ascribed to Peter declaring the resurrection of Jesus and its messianic significance (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/14'>ACT 2:14-36</a>), and a favorable response from the audience (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/37'>ACT 2:37-41</a>). It is likely that the narrative telescopes events that took place over a period of time and on a less dramatic scale. The Twelve were not originally in a position to proclaim publicly the messianic office of Jesus without incurring immediate reprisal from those religious authorities in Jerusalem who had brought about Jesus death precisely to stem the rising tide in his favor."
NABRE,44,2,2,[2] There came from the sky a noise like a strong driving wind: wind and spirit are associated in <a href='/NABRE/43/3/8'>JHN 3:8</a>. The sound of a great rush of wind would herald a new action of God in the history of salvation.

Five of these are attributed to Peter, the final one to Paul.

It is in accord with the apostolic teaching derived from Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/42'>ACT 2:42</a>) and ultimately recorded in the four gospels. Luke presents baptism in Acts as the expected response to the apostolic preaching about Jesus and associates it with the conferring of the Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/5'>ACT 1:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/10/44'>10:44-48</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/11/16'>11:16</a>)."

NABRE,44,3,1,"[1] 3:1-4:31 This section presents a series of related events: the dramatic cure of a lame beggar (<a href='/NABRE/44/3/1'>ACT 3:1-10</a>) produces a large audience for the kerygmatic discourse of Peter (<a href='/NABRE/44/3/11'>ACT 3:11-26</a>). The Sadducees, taking exception to the doctrine of resurrection, have Peter, John, and apparently the beggar as well, arrested (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/1'>ACT 4:1-4</a>) and brought to trial before the Sanhedrin. The issue concerns the authority by which Peter and John publicly teach religious doctrine in the temple (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/5'>ACT 4:5-7</a>). Peter replies with a brief summary of the kerygma, implying that his authority is prophetic (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/8'>ACT 4:8-12</a>). The court warns the apostles to abandon their practice of invoking prophetic authority in the name of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/13'>ACT 4:13-18</a>). When Peter and John reply that the prophetic role cannot be abandoned to satisfy human objections, the court nevertheless releases them, afraid to do otherwise since the beggar, lame from birth and over forty years old, is a well-known figure in Jerusalem and the facts of his cure are common property (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/19'>ACT 4:19-22</a>). The narrative concludes with a prayer of the Christian community imploring divine aid against threats of persecution (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/23'>ACT 4:23-31</a>)."
NABRE,44,3,1,"[2] For the three oclock hour of prayer: literally, ""at the ninth hour of prayer."" With the day beginning at 6 a.m., the ninth hour would be 3 p.m."
NABRE,44,3,6,"[3] 3:6-10 The miracle has a dramatic cast; it symbolizes the saving power of Christ and leads the beggar to enter the temple, where he hears Peters proclamation of salvation through Jesus."
NABRE,44,3,13,"[4] Has glorified: through the resurrection and ascension of Jesus, God reversed the judgment against him on the occasion of his trial. Servant: the Greek word can also be rendered as ""son"" or even ""child"" here and also in <a href='/NABRE/44/3/26'>ACT 3:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/4/25'>4:25</a> (applied to David); <a href='/NABRE/44/4/27'>ACT 4:27</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/44/4/30'>ACT 4:30</a>. Scholars are of the opinion, however, that the original concept reflected in the words identified Jesus with the suffering Servant of the Lord of <a href='/NABRE/23/52/13'>ISA 52:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>53:12</a>."
NABRE,44,3,14,[5] The Holy and Righteous One: so designating Jesus emphasizes his special relationship to the Father (see <a href='/NABRE/42/1/35'>LUK 1:35</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/4/34'>4:34</a>) and emphasizes his sinlessness and religious dignity that are placed in sharp contrast with the guilt of those who rejected him in favor of Barabbas.
NABRE,44,3,15,"[6] The author of life: other possible translations of the Greek title are ""leader of life"" or ""pioneer of life."" The title clearly points to Jesus as the source and originator of salvation."
NABRE,44,3,17,"[7] Ignorance: a Lucan motif, explaining away the actions not only of the people but also of their leaders in crucifying Jesus. On this basis the presbyters in Acts could continue to appeal to the Jews in Jerusalem to believe in Jesus, even while affirming their involvement in his death because they were unaware of his messianic dignity. See also <a href='/NABRE/44/13/27'>ACT 13:27</a> and <a href='/NABRE/42/23/34'>LUK 23:34</a>."
NABRE,44,3,18,"[8] Through the mouth of all the prophets: Christian prophetic insight into the Old Testament saw the crucifixion and death of Jesus as the main import of messianic prophecy. The Jews themselves did not anticipate a suffering Messiah; they usually understood the Servant Song in <a href='/NABRE/23/52/13'>ISA 52:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>53:12</a> to signify their own suffering as a people. In his typical fashion (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/18/31'>LUK 18:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/25'>24:25, 27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/24/44'>44</a>), Luke does not specify the particular Old Testament prophecies that were fulfilled by Jesus. See also note on <a href='/NABRE/42/24/26'>LUK 24:26</a>."
NABRE,44,3,20,"[9] The Lord…and send you the Messiah already appointed for you, Jesus: an allusion to the parousia or second coming of Christ, judged to be imminent in the apostolic age. This reference to its nearness is the only explicit one in Acts. Some scholars believe that this verse preserves a very early christology, in which the title ""Messiah"" (Greek ""Christ"") is applied to him as of his parousia, his second coming (contrast <a href='/NABRE/44/2/36'>ACT 2:36</a>). This view of a future messiahship of Jesus is not found elsewhere in the New Testament."
NABRE,44,3,21,"[10] The times of universal restoration: like ""the times of refreshment"" (<a href='/NABRE/44/3/20'>ACT 3:20</a>), an apocalyptic designation of the messianic age, fitting in with the christology of <a href='/NABRE/44/3/20'>ACT 3:20</a> that associates the messiahship of Jesus with his future coming."
NABRE,44,3,22,"[11] A loose citation of <a href='/NABRE/5/18/15'>DEU 18:15</a>, which teaches that the Israelites are to learn the will of Yahweh from no one but their prophets. At the time of Jesus, some Jews expected a unique prophet to come in fulfillment of this text. Early Christianity applied this tradition and text to Jesus and used them especially in defense of the divergence of Christian teaching from traditional Judaism."
NABRE,44,4,1,"[1] The priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees: the priests performed the temple liturgy; the temple guard was composed of Levites, whose captain ranked next after the high priest. The Sadducees, a party within Judaism at this time, rejected those doctrines, including bodily resurrection, which they believed alien to the ancient Mosaic religion. The Sadducees were drawn from priestly families and from the lay aristocracy."
NABRE,44,4,11,[2] Early Christianity applied this citation from <a href='/NABRE/19/118/22'>PS 118:22</a> to Jesus; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/12/10'>MAK 12:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/2/7'>1PE 2:7</a>.
NABRE,44,4,12,"[3] In the Roman world of Lukes day, salvation was often attributed to the emperor who was hailed as ""savior"" and ""god."" Luke, in the words of Peter, denies that deliverance comes through anyone other than Jesus."
NABRE,44,4,27,"[4] Herod: Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee and Perea from 4 B.C. to A.D. 39, who executed John the Baptist and before whom Jesus was arraigned; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/23/6'>LUK 23:6-12</a>."
NABRE,44,4,31,[5] The place…shook: the earthquake is used as a sign of the divine presence in <a href='/NABRE/2/19/18'>EXO 19:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/6/4'>ISA 6:4</a>. Here the shaking of the building symbolizes Gods favorable response to the prayer. Luke may have had as an additional reason for using the symbol in this sense the fact that it was familiar in the Hellenistic world. Ovid and Virgil also employ it.
NABRE,44,4,31,"[6] 4:32-37 This is the second summary characterizing the Jerusalem community (see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/2/42'>ACT 2:42-47</a>). It emphasizes the system of the distribution of goods and introduces Barnabas, who appears later in Acts as the friend and companion of Paul, and who, as noted here (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/37'>ACT 4:37</a>), endeared himself to the community by a donation of money through the sale of property. This sharing of material possessions continues a practice that Luke describes during the historical ministry of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/42/8/3'>LUK 8:3</a>) and is in accord with the sayings of Jesus in Lukes gospel (<a href='/NABRE/42/12/33'>LUK 12:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/9'>16:9, 11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/16/13'>13</a>)."
NABRE,44,5,1,"[1] 5:1-11 The sin of Ananias and Sapphira did not consist in the withholding of part of the money but in their deception of the community. Their deaths are ascribed to a lie to the holy Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/44/5/3'>ACT 5:3, 9</a>), i.e., they accepted the honor accorded them by the community for their generosity, but in reality they were not deserving of it."
NABRE,44,5,11,"[2] 5:12-16 This, the third summary portraying the Jerusalem community, underscores the Twelve as its bulwark, especially because of their charismatic power to heal the sick; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/2/42'>ACT 2:42-47</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/4/32'>4:32-37</a>."
NABRE,44,5,16,"[3] 5:17-42 A second action against the community is taken by the Sanhedrin in the arrest and trial of the Twelve; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/4/1'>ACT 4:1-3</a>. The motive is the jealousy of the religious authorities over the popularity of the apostles (<a href='/NABRE/44/5/17'>ACT 5:17</a>) who are now charged with the defiance of the Sanhedrins previous order to them to abandon their prophetic role (<a href='/NABRE/44/5/28'>ACT 5:28</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/4/18'>ACT 4:18</a>). In this crisis the apostles are favored by a miraculous release from prison (<a href='/NABRE/44/5/18'>ACT 5:18-24</a>). (For similar incidents involving Peter and Paul, see <a href='/NABRE/44/12/6'>ACT 12:6-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/16/25'>16:25-29</a>.) The real significance of such an event, however, would be manifest only to people of faith, not to unbelievers; since the Sanhedrin already judged the Twelve to be inauthentic prophets, it could disregard reports of their miracles. When the Twelve immediately resumed public teaching, the Sanhedrin determined to invoke upon them the penalty of death (<a href='/NABRE/44/5/33'>ACT 5:33</a>) prescribed in <a href='/NABRE/5/13/6'>DEU 13:6-10</a>. Gamaliels advice against this course finally prevailed, but it did not save the Twelve from the punishment of scourging (<a href='/NABRE/44/5/40'>ACT 5:40</a>) in a last endeavor to shake their conviction of their prophetic mission."
NABRE,44,5,30,"[4] Hanging him on a tree: that is, crucifying him (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/48/3/13'>GAL 3:13</a>)."
NABRE,44,5,31,[5] At his right hand: see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/2/33'>ACT 2:33</a>.
NABRE,44,5,34,"[6] Gamaliel: in <a href='/NABRE/44/22/3'>ACT 22:3</a>, Paul identifies himself as a disciple of this Rabbi Gamaliel I who flourished in Jerusalem between A.D. 25 and 50."
NABRE,44,5,36,"[7] 5:36-37 Gamaliel offers examples of unsuccessful contemporary movements to argue that if God is not the origin of this movement preached by the apostles it will perish by itself. The movement initiated by Theudas actually occurred when C. Cuspius Fadus was governor, A.D. 44-46. Lukes placing of Judas the Galilean after Theudas and at the time of the census (see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/2/1'>LUK 2:1-2</a>) is an indication of the vagueness of his knowledge of these events."
NABRE,44,6,1,"[1] 6:1-7 The Hellenists…the Hebrews: the Hellenists were not necessarily Jews from the diaspora, but were more probably Palestinian Jews who spoke only Greek. The Hebrews were Palestinian Jews who spoke Hebrew or Aramaic and who may also have spoken Greek. Both groups belong to the Jerusalem Jewish Christian community. The conflict between them leads to a restructuring of the community that will better serve the communitys needs. The real purpose of the whole episode, however, is to introduce Stephen as a prominent figure in the community whose long speech and martyrdom will be recounted in <a href='/NABRE/44/7/1'>ACT 7</a>."
NABRE,44,6,2,"[2] 6:2-4 The essential function of the Twelve is the ""service of the word,"" including development of the kerygma by formulation of the teachings of Jesus."
NABRE,44,6,2,"[3] To serve at table: some commentators think that it is not the serving of food that is described here but rather the keeping of the accounts that recorded the distribution of food to the needy members of the community. In any case, after Stephen and the others are chosen, they are never presented carrying out the task for which they were appointed (<a href='/NABRE/44/6/2'>ACT 6:2-3</a>). Rather, two of their number, Stephen and Philip, are presented as preachers of the Christian message. They, the Hellenist counterpart of the Twelve, are active in the ministry of the word."
NABRE,44,6,6,[4] They…laid hands on them: the customary Jewish way of designating persons for a task and invoking upon them the divine blessing and power to perform it.
NABRE,44,6,8,"[5] 6:8-8:1 The summary (<a href='/NABRE/44/6/7'>ACT 6:7</a>) on the progress of the Jerusalem community, illustrated by the conversion of the priests, is followed by a lengthy narrative regarding Stephen. Stephens defense is not a response to the charges made against him but takes the form of a discourse that reviews the fortunes of Gods word to Israel and leads to a prophetic declaration: a plea for the hearing of that word as announced by Christ and now possessed by the Christian community. The charges that Stephen depreciated the importance of the temple and the Mosaic law and elevated Jesus to a stature above Moses (<a href='/NABRE/44/6/13'>ACT 6:13-14</a>) were in fact true. Before the Sanhedrin, no defense against them was possible. With Stephen, who thus perceived the fuller implications of the teachings of Jesus, the differences between Judaism and Christianity began to appear. Lukes account of Stephens martyrdom and its aftermath shows how the major impetus behind the Christian movement passed from Jerusalem, where the temple and law prevailed, to Antioch in Syria, where these influences were less pressing."
NABRE,44,6,13,"[6] False witnesses: here, and in his account of Stephens execution (<a href='/NABRE/44/7/54'>ACT 7:54-60</a>), Luke parallels the martyrdom of Stephen with the death of Jesus."
NABRE,44,7,2,[1] 7:2-53 Stephens speech represents Lukes description of Christianitys break from its Jewish matrix. Two motifs become prominent in the speech: (1) Israels reaction to Gods chosen leaders in the past reveals that the people have consistently rejected them; and (2) Israel has misunderstood Gods choice of the Jerusalem temple as the place where he is to be worshiped.
NABRE,44,7,2,"[2] God…appeared to our father Abraham…in Mesopotamia: the first of a number of minor discrepancies between the data of the Old Testament and the data of Stephens discourse. According to <a href='/NABRE/1/12/1'>GEN 12:1</a>, God first spoke to Abraham in Haran. The main discrepancies are these: in <a href='/NABRE/44/7/16'>ACT 7:16</a> it is said that Jacob was buried in Shechem, whereas <a href='/NABRE/1/50/13'>GEN 50:13</a> says he was buried at Hebron; in the same verse it is said that the tomb was purchased by Abraham, but in <a href='/NABRE/1/33/19'>GEN 33:19</a> and <a href='/NABRE/6/24/32'>JOS 24:32</a> the purchase is attributed to Jacob himself."
NABRE,44,7,55,[3] He…saw…Jesus standing at the right hand of God: Stephen affirms to the Sanhedrin that the prophecy Jesus made before them has been fulfilled (<a href='/NABRE/41/14/62'>MAK 14:62</a>).
NABRE,44,7,57,"[4] Covered their ears: Stephens declaration, like that of Jesus, is a scandal to the court, which regards it as blasphemy."
NABRE,44,7,59,"[5] Compare <a href='/NABRE/42/23/34'>LUK 23:34, 46</a>."
NABRE,44,8,1,"[1] 8:1-40 Some idea of the severity of the persecution that now breaks out against the Jerusalem community can be gathered from <a href='/NABRE/44/22/4'>ACT 22:4</a> and <a href='/NABRE/44/26/9'>ACT 26:9-11</a>. Luke, however, concentrates on the fortunes of the word of God among people, indicating how the dispersal of the Jewish community resulted in the conversion of the Samaritans (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/4'>ACT 8:4-17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/8/25'>25</a>). His narrative is further expanded to include the account of Philips acceptance of an Ethiopian (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/26'>ACT 8:26-39</a>)."
NABRE,44,8,1,"[2] All were scattered…except the apostles: this observation leads some modern scholars to conclude that the persecution was limited to the Hellenist Christians and that the Hebrew Christians were not molested, perhaps because their attitude toward the law and temple was still more in line with that of their fellow Jews (see the charge leveled against the Hellenist Stephen in <a href='/NABRE/44/6/13'>ACT 6:13-14</a>). Whatever the facts, it appears that the Twelve took no public stand regarding Stephens position, choosing, instead, to await the development of events."
NABRE,44,8,3,"[3] Saul…was trying to destroy the church: like Stephen, Saul was able to perceive that the Christian movement contained the seeds of doctrinal divergence from Judaism. A pupil of Gamaliel, according to <a href='/NABRE/44/22/3'>ACT 22:3</a>, and totally dedicated to the law as the way of salvation (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/13'>GAL 1:13-14</a>), Saul accepted the task of crushing the Christian movement, at least insofar as it detracted from the importance of the temple and the law. His vehement opposition to Christianity reveals how difficult it was for a Jew of his time to accept a messianism that differed so greatly from the general expectation."
NABRE,44,8,9,"[4] 8:9-13, 18-24 Sorcerers were well known in the ancient world. Probably the incident involving Simon and his altercation with Peter is introduced to show that the miraculous charisms possessed by members of the Christian community (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/6'>ACT 8:6-7</a>) were not to be confused with the magic of sorcerers."
NABRE,44,8,16,"[5] Here and in <a href='/NABRE/44/10/44'>ACT 10:44-48</a> and <a href='/NABRE/44/19/1'>ACT 19:1-6</a>, Luke distinguishes between baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus and the reception of the Spirit. In each case, the Spirit is conferred through members of the Twelve (Peter and John) or their representative (Paul). This may be Lukes way of describing the role of the church in the bestowal of the Spirit. Elsewhere in Acts, baptism and the Spirit are more closely related (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/5'>ACT 1:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/11/16'>11:16</a>)."
NABRE,44,8,18,[6] 8:18-20 Simon attempts to buy the gift of God (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/20'>ACT 8:20</a>) with money. Peters cursing of Simons attempt so to use his money expresses a typically Lucan attitude toward material wealth (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/6/24'>LUK 6:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/16'>12:16-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/13'>16:13</a>).
NABRE,44,8,25,"[7] 8:26-40 In the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch, Luke adduces additional evidence to show that the spread of Christianity outside the confines of Judaism itself was in accord with the plan of God. He does not make clear whether the Ethiopian was originally a convert to Judaism or, as is more probable, a ""God-fearer"" (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/1'>ACT 10:1</a>), i.e., one who accepted Jewish monotheism and ethic and attended the synagogue but did not consider himself bound by other regulations such as circumcision and observance of the dietary laws. The story of his conversion to Christianity is given a strong supernatural cast by the introduction of an angel (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/26'>ACT 8:26</a>), instruction from the holy Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/29'>ACT 8:29</a>), and the strange removal of Philip from the scene (<a href='/NABRE/44/8/39'>8:39</a>)."
NABRE,44,8,27,[8] The Candace: Candace is not a proper name here but the title of a Nubian queen.
NABRE,44,8,30,"[9] 8:30-34 Philip is brought alongside the carriage at the very moment when the Ethiopian is pondering the meaning of <a href='/NABRE/23/53/7'>ISA 53:7-8</a>, a passage that Christianity, from its earliest origins, has applied to Jesus; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/44/3/13'>ACT 3:13</a>."
NABRE,44,8,37,"[10] The oldest and best manuscripts of Acts omit this verse, which is a Western text reading: ""And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may. And he said in reply, I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."""
NABRE,44,9,1,"[1] 9:1-19 This is the first of three accounts of Pauls conversion (with <a href='/NABRE/44/22/3'>ACT 22:3-16</a> and <a href='/NABRE/44/26/2'>ACT 26:2-18</a>) with some differences of detail owing to Lukes use of different sources. Pauls experience was not visionary but was precipitated by the appearance of Jesus, as he insists in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/8'>1CO 15:8</a>. The words of Jesus, ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"" related by Luke with no variation in all three accounts, exerted a profound and lasting influence on the thought of Paul. Under the influence of this experience he gradually developed his understanding of justification by faith (see the letters to the Galatians and Romans) and of the identification of the Christian community with Jesus Christ (see <a href='/NABRE/46/12/27'>1CO 12:27</a>). That Luke would narrate this conversion three times is testimony to the importance he attaches to it. This first account occurs when the word is first spread to the Gentiles. At this point, the conversion of the hero of the Gentile mission is recounted. The emphasis in the account is on Paul as a divinely chosen instrument (<a href='/NABRE/44/9/15'>ACT 9:15</a>)."
NABRE,44,9,2,"[2] The Way: a name used by the early Christian community for itself (<a href='/NABRE/44/18/26'>ACT 18:26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/19/9'>19:9, 23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/4'>22:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/24/14'>24:14, 22</a>).

NABRE,44,9,8,[3] He could see nothing: a temporary blindness (<a href='/NABRE/44/9/18'>ACT 9:18</a>) symbolizing the religious blindness of Saul as persecutor (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/26/18'>ACT 26:18</a>).

NABRE,44,9,19,[5] 9:19-30 This is a brief resume of Pauls initial experience as an apostolic preacher. At first he found himself in the position of being regarded as an apostate by the Jews and suspect by the Christian community of Jerusalem. His acceptance by the latter was finally brought about through his friendship with Barnabas (<a href='/NABRE/44/9/27'>ACT 9:27</a>).

NABRE,44,9,31,"[9] 9:31-43 In the context of the period of peace enjoyed by the community through the cessation of Pauls activities against it, Luke introduces two traditions concerning the miraculous power exercised by Peter as he was making a tour of places where the Christian message had already been preached. The towns of Lydda, Sharon, and Joppa were populated by both Jews and Gentiles and their Christian communities may well have been mixed."
NABRE,44,9,36,"[10] Tabitha(Dorcas), respectively the Aramaic and Greek words for ""gazelle,"" exemplifies the right attitude toward material possessions expressed by Jesus in the Lucan Gospel (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/30'>LUK 6:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/11/41'>11:41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/33'>12:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/18/22'>18:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/19/8'>19:8</a>)."

NABRE,44,10,1,"[1] 10:1-48 The narrative centers on the conversion of Cornelius, a Gentile and a ""God-fearer"" (see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/8/26'>ACT 8:26-40</a>). Luke considers the event of great importance, as is evident from his long treatment of it. The incident is again related in <a href='/NABRE/44/11/1'>ACT 11:1-18</a> where Peter is forced to justify his actions before the Jerusalem community and alluded to in <a href='/NABRE/44/15/7'>ACT 15:7-11</a> where at the Jerusalem ""Council"" Peter supports Pauls missionary activity among the Gentiles. The narrative divides itself into a series of distinct episodes, concluding with Peters presentation of the Christian kerygma (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/4'>ACT 10:4-43</a>) and a pentecostal experience undergone by Cornelius household preceding their reception of baptism (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/44'>ACT 10:44-48</a>)."

The necessity of such instructions to Peter reveals that at first not even the apostles fully grasped the implications of Jesus teaching on the law. In Acts, the initial insight belongs to Stephen."

NABRE,44,10,17,"[8] 10:17-23 The arrival of the Gentile emissaries with their account of the angelic apparition illuminates Peters vision: he is to be prepared to admit Gentiles, who were considered unclean like the animals of his vision, into the Christian community."
NABRE,44,10,24,"[9] 10:24-27 So impressed is Cornelius with the apparition that he invites close personal friends to join him in his meeting with Peter. But his understanding of the person he is about to meet is not devoid of superstition, suggested by his falling down before him. For a similar experience of Paul and Barnabas, see <a href='/NABRE/44/14/11'>ACT 14:11-18</a>."

NABRE,44,10,34,[13] 10:34-35 The revelation of Gods choice of Israel to be the people of God did not mean he withheld the divine favor from other people.
NABRE,44,10,36,"[14] 10:36-43 These words are more directed to Lukes Christian readers than to the household of Cornelius, as indicated by the opening words, ""You know."" They trace the continuity between the preaching and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth and the proclamation of Jesus by the early community. The emphasis on this divinely ordained continuity (<a href='/NABRE/44/10/41'>ACT 10:41</a>) is meant to assure Lukes readers of the fidelity of Christian tradition to the words and deeds of Jesus."
NABRE,44,10,36,"[15] To the Israelites: Luke, in the words of Peter, speaks of the prominent position occupied by Israel in the history of salvation."
NABRE,44,10,38,"[16] Jesus of Nazareth: Gods revelation of his plan for the destiny of humanity through Israel culminated in Jesus of Nazareth. Consequently, the ministry of Jesus is an integral part of Gods revelation. This viewpoint explains why the early Christian communities were interested in conserving the historical substance of the ministry of Jesus, a tradition leading to the production of the four gospels."
NABRE,44,10,39,"[17] We are witnesses: the apostolic testimony was not restricted to the resurrection of Jesus but also included his historical ministry. This witness, however, was theological in character; the Twelve, divinely mandated as prophets, were empowered to interpret his sayings and deeds in the light of his redemptive death and resurrection. The meaning of these words and deeds was to be made clear to the developing Christian community as the bearer of the word of salvation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/1/21'>ACT 1:21-26</a>). Hanging him on a tree: see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/5/30'>ACT 5:30</a>."
NABRE,44,10,42,"[18] As judge of the living and the dead: the apostolic preaching to the Jews appealed to their messianic hope, while the preaching to Gentiles stressed the coming divine judgment; cf. <a href='/NABRE/52/1/10'>1TS 1:10</a>."
NABRE,44,10,44,"[19] Just as the Jewish Christians received the gift of the Spirit, so too do the Gentiles."
NABRE,44,11,1,"[1] 11:1-18 The Jewish Christians of Jerusalem were scandalized to learn of Peters sojourn in the house of the Gentile Cornelius. Nonetheless, they had to accept the divine directions given to both Peter and Cornelius. They concluded that the setting aside of the legal barriers between Jew and Gentile was an exceptional ordinance of God to indicate that the apostolic kerygma was also to be directed to the Gentiles. Only in <a href='/NABRE/44/15/1'>ACT 15</a> at the ""Council"" in Jerusalem does the evangelization of the Gentiles become the official position of the church leadership in Jerusalem."

NABRE,44,11,18,"[4] 11:19-26 The Jewish Christian antipathy to the mixed community was reflected by the early missionaries generally. The few among them who entertained a different view succeeded in introducing Gentiles into the community at Antioch (in Syria). When the disconcerted Jerusalem community sent Barnabas to investigate, he was so favorably impressed by what he observed that he persuaded his friend Saul to participate in the Antioch mission."
NABRE,44,11,26,"[5] Christians: ""Christians"" is first applied to the members of the community at Antioch because the Gentile members of the community enable it to stand out clearly from Judaism."
NABRE,44,11,26,"[6] 11:27-30 It is not clear whether the prophets from Jerusalem came to Antioch to request help in view of the coming famine or whether they received this insight during their visit there. The former supposition seems more likely. Suetonius and Tacitus speak of famines during the reign of Claudius (A.D. 41-54), while the Jewish historian Josephus mentions a famine in Judea in A.D. 46-48. Luke is interested, rather, in showing the charity of the Antiochene community toward the Jewish Christians of Jerusalem despite their differences on mixed communities."
NABRE,44,11,30,"[7] Presbyters: this is the same Greek word that elsewhere is translated ""elders,"" primarily in reference to the Jewish community."
NABRE,44,12,1,"[1] 12:1-19 Herod Agrippa ruled Judea A.D. 41-44. While Luke does not assign a motive for his execution of James and his intended execution of Peter, the broad background lies in Herods support of Pharisaic Judaism. The Jewish Christians had lost the popularity they had had in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/47'>ACT 2:47</a>), perhaps because of suspicions against them traceable to the teaching of Stephen."
NABRE,44,12,2,"[2] James, the brother of John: this James, the son of Zebedee, was beheaded by Herod Agrippa ca. A.D. 44."
NABRE,44,12,3,"[3] 12:3, 4 Feast of Unleavened Bread…Passover: see note on <a href='/NABRE/42/22/1'>LUK 22:1</a>."
NABRE,44,12,17,"[4] To James: this James is not the son of Zebedee mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/44/12/2'>ACT 12:2</a>, but is James, the ""brother of the Lord"" (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/19'>GAL 1:19</a>), who in <a href='/NABRE/44/15/1'>ACT 15</a>; 21 is presented as leader of the Jerusalem Christian community. He left and went to another place: the conjecture that Peter left for Rome at this time has nothing to recommend it. His chief responsibility was still the leadership of the Jewish Christian community in Palestine (see <a href='/NABRE/48/2/7'>GAL 2:7</a>). The concept of the great missionary effort of the church was yet to come (see <a href='/NABRE/44/13/1'>ACT 13:1-3</a>)."
NABRE,44,12,20,[5] 12:20-23 Josephus gives a similar account of Herods death that occurred in A.D. 44. Early Christian tradition considered the manner of it to be a divine punishment upon his evil life. See <a href='/NABRE/12/19/35'>2KG 19:35</a> for the figure of the angel of the Lord in such a context.
NABRE,44,12,25,"[6] They returned to Jerusalem: many manuscripts read ""from Jerusalem,"" since <a href='/NABRE/44/11/30'>ACT 11:30</a> implies that Paul and Barnabas are already in Jerusalem. This present verse could refer to a return visit or subsequent relief mission."
NABRE,44,13,1,"[1] 13:1-3 The impulse for the first missionary effort in Asia Minor is ascribed to the prophets of the Antiochene community, under the inspiration of the holy Spirit. Just as the Jerusalem community had earlier been the center of missionary activity, so too Antioch becomes the center from which the missionaries Barnabas and Saul are sent out."
NABRE,44,13,4,"[2] 13:4-14:27 The key event in Lukes account of the first missionary journey is the experience of Paul and Barnabas at Pisidian Antioch (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/14'>ACT 13:14-52</a>). The Christian kerygma proclaimed by Paul in the synagogue was favorably received. Some Jews and ""God-fearers"" (see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/8/26'>ACT 8:26-40</a>) became interested and invited the missionaries to speak again on the following sabbath (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/42'>ACT 13:42</a>). By that time, however, the appearance of a large number of Gentiles from the city had so disconcerted the Jews that they became hostile toward the apostles (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/44'>ACT 13:44-50</a>). This hostility of theirs appears in all three accounts of Pauls missionary journeys in Acts, the Jews of Iconium (<a href='/NABRE/44/14/1'>ACT 14:1-2</a>) and Beroea (<a href='/NABRE/44/17/11'>ACT 17:11</a>) being notable exceptions."

NABRE,44,13,6,"[4] A magician named Bar-Jesus who was a Jewish false prophet: that is, he posed as a prophet. Again Luke takes the opportunity to dissociate Christianity from the magical acts of the time (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/7'>ACT 13:7-11</a>); see also <a href='/NABRE/44/8/18'>ACT 8:18-24</a>."
NABRE,44,13,9,"[5] Saul, also known as Paul: there is no reason to believe that his name was changed from Saul to Paul upon his conversion. The use of a double name, one Semitic (Saul), the other Greco-Roman (Paul), is well attested (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/1/23'>ACT 1:23</a>, Joseph Justus; <a href='/NABRE/44/12/12'>ACT 12:12, 25</a>, John Mark)."
NABRE,44,13,16,[6] 13:16-41 This is the first of several speeches of Paul to Jews proclaiming that the Christian church is the logical development of Pharisaic Judaism (see also <a href='/NABRE/44/24/10'>ACT 24:10-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/26/2'>26:2-23</a>).

NABRE,44,13,18,"[8] Put up with: some manuscripts read ""sustained."""
NABRE,44,13,20,"[9] At the end of about four hundred and fifty years: the manuscript tradition makes it uncertain whether the mention of four hundred and fifty years refers to the sojourn in Egypt before the Exodus, the wilderness period and the time of the conquest (see <a href='/NABRE/2/12/40'>EXO 12:40-41</a>), as the translation here suggests, or to the time between the conquest and the time of Samuel, the period of the judges, if the text is read, ""After these things, for about four hundred and fifty years, he provided judges."""
NABRE,44,13,31,[10] The theme of the Galilean witnesses is a major one in the Gospel of Luke and in Acts and is used to signify the continuity between the teachings of Jesus and the teachings of the church and to guarantee the fidelity of the churchs teachings to the words of Jesus.
NABRE,44,13,38,"[11] 13:38-39 Justified: the verb is the same as that used in Pauls letters to speak of the experience of justification and, as in Paul, is here connected with the term ""to have faith"" (""every believer""). But this seems the only passage about Paul in Acts where justification is mentioned. In Lucan fashion it is paralleled with ""forgiveness of sins"" (a theme at <a href='/NABRE/44/2/38'>ACT 2:38</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/19'>3:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/5/31'>5:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/10/43'>10:43</a>) based on Jesus resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/37'>ACT 13:37</a>) rather than his cross, and is put negatively (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/38'>ACT 13:38</a>). Therefore, some would translate, ""in regard to everything from which you could not be acquitted…every believer is acquitted."""
NABRE,44,13,46,"[12] The refusal to believe frustrates Gods plan for his chosen people; however, no adverse judgment is made here concerning their ultimate destiny. Again, Luke, in the words of Paul, speaks of the priority of Israel in the plan for salvation (see <a href='/NABRE/44/10/36'>ACT 10:36</a>)."
NABRE,44,13,51,[13] See note on <a href='/NABRE/42/9/5'>LUK 9:5</a>.
NABRE,44,14,8,"[1] 14:8-18 In an effort to convince his hearers that the divine power works through his word, Paul cures the cripple. However, the pagan tradition of the occasional appearance of gods among human beings leads the people astray in interpreting the miracle. The incident reveals the cultural difficulties with which the church had to cope. Note the similarity of the miracle worked here by Paul to the one performed by Peter in <a href='/NABRE/44/3/2'>ACT 3:2-10</a>."
NABRE,44,14,12,"[2] Zeus…Hermes: in Greek religion, Zeus was the chief of the Olympian gods, the ""father of gods and men""; Hermes was a son of Zeus and was usually identified as the herald and messenger of the gods."

NABRE,44,14,15,"[4] 14:15-17 This is the first speech of Paul to Gentiles recorded by Luke in Acts (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/17/22'>ACT 17:22-31</a>). Rather than showing how Christianity is the logical outgrowth of Judaism, as he does in speeches before Jews, Luke says that God excuses past Gentile ignorance and then presents a natural theology arguing for the recognition of Gods existence and presence through his activity in natural phenomena."
NABRE,44,14,23,"[5] They appointed presbyters: the communities are given their own religious leaders by the traveling missionaries. The structure in these churches is patterned on the model of the Jerusalem community (<a href='/NABRE/44/11/30'>ACT 11:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/15/2'>15:2, 5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/15/22'>22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/21/18'>21:18</a>)."
NABRE,44,15,1,"[1] 15:1-35 The Jerusalem ""Council"" marks the official rejection of the rigid view that Gentile converts were obliged to observe the Mosaic law completely. From here to the end of Acts, Paul and the Gentile mission become the focus of Lukes writing."
NABRE,44,15,1,"[2] 15:1-5 When some of the converted Pharisees of Jerusalem discover the results of the first missionary journey of Paul, they urge that the Gentiles be taught to follow the Mosaic law. Recognizing the authority of the Jerusalem church, Paul and Barnabas go there to settle the question of whether Gentiles can embrace a form of Christianity that does not include this obligation."
NABRE,44,15,6,"[3] 15:6-12 The gathering is possibly the same as that recalled by Paul in <a href='/NABRE/48/2/1'>GAL 2:1-10</a>. Note that in <a href='/NABRE/44/15/2'>ACT 15:2</a> it is only the apostles and presbyters, a small group, with whom Paul and Barnabas are to meet. Here Luke gives the meeting a public character because he wishes to emphasize its doctrinal significance (see <a href='/NABRE/44/15/22'>ACT 15:22</a>)."
NABRE,44,15,7,[4] 15:7-11 Pauls refusal to impose the Mosaic law on the Gentile Christians is supported by Peter on the ground that within his own experience God bestowed the holy Spirit upon Cornelius and his household without preconditions concerning the adoption of the Mosaic law (see <a href='/NABRE/44/10/44'>ACT 10:44-47</a>).
NABRE,44,15,11,"[5] In support of Paul, Peter formulates the fundamental meaning of the gospel: that all are invited to be saved through faith in the power of Christ."
NABRE,44,15,13,"[6] 15:13-35 Some scholars think that this apostolic decree suggested by James, the immediate leader of the Jerusalem community, derives from another historical occasion than the meeting in question. This seems to be the case if the meeting is the same as the one related in <a href='/NABRE/48/2/1'>GAL 2:1-10</a>. According to that account, nothing was imposed upon Gentile Christians in respect to Mosaic law; whereas the decree instructs Gentile Christians of mixed communities to abstain from meats sacrificed to idols and from blood-meats, and to avoid marriage within forbidden degrees of consanguinity and affinity (<a href='/NABRE/3/18/1'>LEV 18</a>), all of which practices were especially abhorrent to Jews. Luke seems to have telescoped two originally independent incidents here: the first a Jerusalem ""Council"" that dealt with the question of circumcision, and the second a Jerusalem decree dealing mainly with Gentile observance of dietary laws (see <a href='/NABRE/44/21/25'>ACT 21:25</a> where Paul seems to be learning of the decree for the first time)."
NABRE,44,15,14,"[7] Symeon: elsewhere in Acts he is called either Peter or Simon. The presence of the name Symeon here suggests that, in the source Luke is using for this part of the Jerusalem ""Council"" incident, the name may have originally referred to someone other than Peter (see <a href='/NABRE/44/13/1'>ACT 13:1</a> where the Antiochene Symeon Niger is mentioned). As the text now stands, however, it is undoubtedly a reference to Simon Peter (<a href='/NABRE/44/15/7'>ACT 15:7</a>)."
NABRE,44,15,34,"[8] Some manuscripts add, in various wordings, ""But Silas decided to remain there."""
NABRE,44,15,36,"[9] 15:36-18:22 This continuous narrative recounts Pauls second missionary journey. On the internal evidence of the Lucan account, it lasted about three years. Paul first visited the communities he had established on his first journey (<a href='/NABRE/44/16/1'>ACT 16:1-5</a>), then pushed on into Macedonia, where he established communities at Philippi, Thessalonica, and Beroea (<a href='/NABRE/44/16/7'>ACT 16:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/44/17/5'>17:5</a>). To escape the hostility of the Jews of Thessalonica, he left for Greece and while resident in Athens attempted, without success, to establish an effective Christian community there. From Athens he proceeded to Corinth and, after a stay of a year and a half, returned to Antioch by way of Ephesus and Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/44/17/16'>ACT 17:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/44/18/22'>18:22</a>). Luke does not concern himself with the structure or statistics of the communities but aims to show the general progress of the gospel in the Gentile world as well as its continued failure to take root in the Jewish community."
NABRE,44,16,3,"[1] Paul had him circumcised: he did this in order that Timothy might be able to associate with the Jews and so perform a ministry among them. Paul did not object to the Jewish Christians adherence to the law. But he insisted that the law could not be imposed on the Gentiles. Paul himself lived in accordance with the law, or as exempt from the law, according to particular circumstances (see <a href='/NABRE/46/9/19'>1CO 9:19-23</a>)."
NABRE,44,16,7,"[2] The Spirit of Jesus: this is an unusual formulation in Lukes writings. The parallelism with <a href='/NABRE/44/16/6'>ACT 16:6</a> indicates its meaning, the holy Spirit."
NABRE,44,16,10,"[3] 16:10-17 This is the first of the so-called ""we-sections"" in Acts, where Luke writes as one of Pauls companions. The other passages are <a href='/NABRE/44/20/5'>ACT 20:5-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/21/1'>21:1-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/27/1'>27:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/44/28/16'>28:16</a>. Scholars debate whether Luke may not have used the first person plural simply as a literary device to lend color to the narrative. The realism of the narrative, however, lends weight to the argument that the ""we"" includes Luke or another companion of Paul whose data Luke used as a source."
NABRE,44,16,11,[4] 16:11-40 The church at Philippi became a flourishing community to which Paul addressed one of his letters (see Introduction to the Letter to the Philippians).

NABRE,44,17,15,"[3] 17:16-21 Pauls presence in Athens sets the stage for the great discourse before a Gentile audience in <a href='/NABRE/44/17/22'>ACT 17:22-31</a>. Although Athens was a politically insignificant city at this period, it still lived on the glories of its past and represented the center of Greek culture. The setting describes the conflict between Christian preaching and Hellenistic philosophy."
NABRE,44,17,18,"[4] Epicurean and Stoic philosophers: for the followers of Epicurus (342-271 B.C.), the goal of life was happiness attained through sober reasoning and the searching out of motives for all choice and avoidance. The Stoics were followers of Zeno, a younger contemporary of Alexander the Great. Zeno and his followers believed in a type of pantheism that held that the spark of divinity was present in all reality and that, in order to be free, each person must live ""according to nature."" This scavenger: literally, ""seed-picker,"" as of a bird that picks up grain. The word is later used of scrap collectors and of people who take other peoples ideas and propagate them as if they were their own. Promoter of foreign deities: according to Xenophon, Socrates was accused of promoting new deities. The accusation against Paul echoes the charge against Socrates. Jesus and Resurrection: the Athenians are presented as misunderstanding Paul from the outset; they think he is preaching about Jesus and a goddess named Anastasis, i.e., Resurrection."
NABRE,44,17,19,"[5] To the Areopagus: the ""Areopagus"" refers either to the Hill of Ares west of the Acropolis or to the Council of Athens, which at one time met on the hill but which at this time assembled in the Royal Colonnade (Stoa Basileios)."
NABRE,44,17,22,"[6] 17:22-31 In Pauls appearance at the Areopagus he preaches his climactic speech to Gentiles in the cultural center of the ancient world. The speech is more theological than christological. Pauls discourse appeals to the Greek worlds belief in divinity as responsible for the origin and existence of the universe. It contests the common belief in a multiplicity of gods supposedly exerting their powers through their images. It acknowledges that the attempt to find God is a constant human endeavor. It declares, further, that God is the judge of the human race, that the time of the judgment has been determined, and that it will be executed through a man whom God raised from the dead. The speech reflects sympathy with pagan religiosity, handles the subject of idol worship gently, and appeals for a new examination of divinity, not from the standpoint of creation but from the standpoint of judgment."

NABRE,44,18,23,[9] 18:23-21:16 Lukes account of Pauls third missionary journey devotes itself mainly to his work at Ephesus (<a href='/NABRE/44/19/1'>ACT 19:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/44/20/1'>20:1</a>). There is a certain restiveness on Pauls part and a growing conviction that the Spirit bids him return to Jerusalem and prepare to go to Rome (<a href='/NABRE/44/19/21'>ACT 19:21</a>).
NABRE,44,18,24,"[10] 18:24-25 Apollos appears as a preacher who knows the teaching of Jesus in the context of Johns baptism of repentance. Aquila and Priscilla instruct him more fully.

NABRE,44,19,24,"[2] Miniature silver shrines of Artemis: the temple of Artemis at Ephesus was one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Artemis, originally the Olympian virgin hunter, moon goddess, and goddess of wild nature, was worshiped at Ephesus as an Asian mother goddess and goddess of fertility. She was one of the most widely worshiped female deities in the Hellenistic world (see <a href='/NABRE/44/18/27'>ACT 18:27</a>)."
NABRE,44,19,31,[3] Asiarchs: the precise status and role of the Asiarchs is disputed. They appear to have been people of wealth and influence who promoted the Roman imperial cult and who may also have been political representatives in a league of cities in the Roman province of Asia.
NABRE,44,19,35,[4] Guardian of the temple: this title was accorded by Rome to cities that provided a temple for the imperial cult. Inscriptional evidence indicates that Ephesus was acknowledged as the temple keeper of Artemis and of the imperial cult. That fell from the sky: many scholars think that this refers to a meteorite that was worshiped as an image of the goddess.

NABRE,44,22,21,[3] Paul endeavors to explain that his position on the law has not been identical with that of his audience because it has been his prophetic mission to preach to the Gentiles to whom the law was not addressed and who had no faith in it as a way of salvation.
NABRE,44,22,22,[4] Pauls suggestion that his prophetic mission to the Gentiles did not involve his imposing the law on them provokes the same opposition as occurred in Pisidian Antioch (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/45'>ACT 13:45</a>).

NABRE,44,23,11,[4] The occurrence of the vision of Christ consoling Paul and assuring him that he will be his witness in Rome prepares the reader for the final section of Acts: the journey of Paul and the word he preaches to Rome under the protection of the Romans.

NABRE,44,23,26,"[7] 23:26-30 The letter emphasizes the fact that Paul is a Roman citizen and asserts the lack of evidence that he is guilty of a crime against the empire. The tone of the letter implies that the commander became initially involved in Pauls case because of his Roman citizenship, but this is not an exact description of what really happened (see <a href='/NABRE/44/21/31'>ACT 21:31-33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/25'>22:25-29</a>)."

NABRE,44,24,10,"[3] 24:10-21 Whereas the advocate Tertullus referred to Pauls activities on his missionary journeys, the apostle narrowed the charges down to the riot connected with the incident in the temple (see <a href='/NABRE/44/21/27'>ACT 21:27-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/24/17'>24:17-20</a>). In his defense, Paul stresses the continuity between Christianity and Judaism."
NABRE,44,24,24,"[4] 24:24, 25 The way of Christian discipleship greatly disquiets Felix, who has entered into an adulterous marriage with Drusilla, daughter of Herod Agrippa I. This marriage provides the background for the topics Paul speaks about and about which Felix does not want to hear."

Paul uses his right as a Roman citizen to appeal his case to the jurisdiction of the Emperor (Nero, ca. A.D. 60) (<a href='/NABRE/44/25/12'>ACT 25:12</a>). This move broke the deadlock between Roman protective custody of Paul and the plan of his enemies to kill him (<a href='/NABRE/44/25/3'>25:3</a>)."

NABRE,44,26,2,[1] 26:2-23 Pauls final defense speech in Acts is now made before a king (see <a href='/NABRE/44/9/15'>ACT 9:15</a>). In the speech Paul presents himself as a zealous Pharisee and Christianity as the logical development of Pharisaic Judaism. The story of his conversion is recounted for the third time in Acts in this speech (see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/9/1'>ACT 9:1-19</a>).

NABRE,44,26,14,[3] In Hebrew: see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/21/40'>ACT 21:40</a>. It is hard for you to kick against the goad: this proverb is commonly found in Greek literature and in this context signifies the senselessness and ineffectiveness of any opposition to the divine influence in his life.
NABRE,44,26,16,[4] The words of Jesus directed to Paul here reflect the dialogues between Christ and Ananias (<a href='/NABRE/44/9/15'>ACT 9:15</a>) and between Ananias and Paul (<a href='/NABRE/44/22/14'>ACT 22:14-15</a>) in the two previous accounts of Pauls conversion.

NABRE,44,26,26,"[8] Not done in a corner: for Luke, this Greek proverb expresses his belief that he is presenting a story about Jesus and the church that is already well known. As such, the entire history of Christianity is public knowledge and incontestable. Luke presents his story in this way to provide ""certainty"" to his readers about the instructions they have received (<a href='/NABRE/42/1/4'>LUK 1:4</a>)."
NABRE,44,26,27,"[9] 26:27-28 If the Christian missionaries proclaim nothing different from what the Old Testament prophets had proclaimed (<a href='/NABRE/44/26/22'>ACT 26:22-23</a>), then the logical outcome for the believing Jew, according to Luke, is to become a Christian."
NABRE,44,26,31,"[10] 26:31-32 In recording the episode of Pauls appearance before Agrippa, Luke wishes to show that, when Pauls case was judged impartially, no grounds for legal action against him were found (see <a href='/NABRE/44/23/29'>ACT 23:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/25/25'>25:25</a>)."
NABRE,44,27,1,"[1] 27:1-28:16 Here Luke has written a stirring account of adventure on the high seas, incidental to his main purpose of showing how well Paul got along with his captors and how his prophetic influence saved the lives of all on board. The recital also establishes the existence of Christian communities in Puteoli and Rome. This account of the voyage and shipwreck also constitutes the final ""we-section"" in Acts (see note on <a href='/NABRE/44/16/10'>ACT 16:10-17</a>)."
NABRE,44,27,1,"[2] Cohort Augusta: the presence of a Cohort Augusta in Syria during the first century A.D. is attested in inscriptions.

NABRE,44,28,16,"[3] With Pauls arrival in Rome, the programmatic spread of the word of the Lord to ""the ends of the earth"" (<a href='/NABRE/44/1/8'>ACT 1:8</a>) is accomplished. In Rome, Paul is placed under house arrest, and under this mild form of custody he is allowed to proclaim the word in the capital of the civilized world of his day."
NABRE,44,28,17,"[4] 28:17-22 Pauls first act in Rome is to learn from the leaders of the Jewish community whether the Jews of Jerusalem plan to pursue their case against him before the Roman jurisdiction. He is informed that no such plan is afoot, but that the Jews of Rome have heard the Christian teaching denounced. Pauls offer to explain it to them is readily accepted."
NABRE,44,28,20,"[5] The hope of Israel: in the words of Paul (<a href='/NABRE/44/23/6'>ACT 23:6</a>), Luke has identified this hope as hope in the resurrection of the dead."
NABRE,44,28,25,"[6] 28:25-28 Pauls final words in Acts reflect a major concern of Lukes writings: how the salvation promised in the Old Testament, accomplished by Jesus, and offered first to Israel (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/26'>ACT 13:26</a>), has now been offered to and accepted by the Gentiles. Quoting <a href='/NABRE/23/6/9'>ISA 6:9-10</a>, Paul presents the scriptural support for his indictment of his fellow Jews who refuse to accept the message he proclaims. Their rejection leads to its proclamation among the Gentiles."
NABRE,44,28,29,"[7] The Western text has added here a verse that is not found in the best Greek manuscripts: ""And when he had said this, the Jews left, seriously arguing among themselves."""
NABRE,44,28,30,"[8] 28:30-31 Although the ending of Acts may seem to be abrupt, Luke has now completed his story with the establishment of Paul and the proclamation of Christianity in Rome. Pauls confident and unhindered proclamation of the gospel in Rome forms the climax to the story whose outline was provided in <a href='/NABRE/44/1/8'>ACT 1:8</a>—""You will be my witnesses in Jerusalem…and to the ends of the earth."""
NABRE,45,1,1,"[1] 1:1-7 In Pauls letters the greeting or praescriptiofollows a standard form, though with variations. It is based upon the common Greco-Roman epistolary practice, but with the addition of Semitic and specifically Christian elements. The three basic components are: name of sender; name of addressee; greeting. In identifying himself, Paul often adds phrases to describe his apostolic mission; this element is more developed in Romans than in any other letter. Elsewhere he associates co-workers with himself in the greeting: Sosthenes (1 Corinthians), Timothy (2 Corinthians; Philippians; Philemon) Silvanus (1 Thessalonians—2 Thessalonians). The standard secular greeting was the infinitive chairein, ""greetings."" Paul uses instead the similar-sounding charis, ""grace,"" together with the Semitic greeting šālôm(Greek eirēnē), ""peace."" These gifts, foreshadowed in Gods dealings with Israel (see <a href='/NABRE/4/6/24'>NUM 6:24-26</a>), have been poured out abundantly in Christ, and Paul wishes them to his readers. In Romans the Pauline praescriptiois expanded and expressed in a formal tone; it emphasizes Pauls office as apostle to the Gentiles. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/3'>ROM 1:3-4</a> stress the gospel or kerygma, <a href='/NABRE/45/1/2'>ROM 1:2</a> the fulfillment of Gods promise, and <a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1:1, 5</a> Pauls office.

NABRE,45,1,1,"[2] Slave of Christ Jesus: Paul applies the term slave to himself in order to express his undivided allegiance to the Lord of the church, the Master of all, including slaves and masters. ""No one can serve (i.e., be a slave to) two masters,"" said Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/6/24'>MAT 6:24</a>). It is this aspect of the slave-master relationship rather than its degrading implications that Paul emphasizes when he discusses Christian commitment."
NABRE,45,1,3,"[3] 1:3-4 Paul here cites an early confession that proclaims Jesus sonship as messianic descendant of David (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/22/42'>MAT 22:42</a>; <a href='/NABRE/55/2/8'>2TM 2:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/22/16'>REV 22:16</a>) and as Son of God by the resurrection.

NABRE,45,1,5,"[4] Paul recalls his apostolic office, implying that the Romans know something of his history. The obedience of faith: as Paul will show at length in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>6</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/8/1'>8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/45/8/12'>12</a>-15, faith in Gods justifying action in Jesus Christ relates one to Gods gift of the new life that is made possible through the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ and the activity of the holy Spirit (see especially <a href='/NABRE/45/8/1'>ROM 8:1-11</a>)."
NABRE,45,1,7,"[5] Called to be holy: Paul often refers to Christians as ""the holy ones"" or ""the saints."" The Israelite community was called a ""holy assembly"" because they had been separated for the worship and service of the Lord (see <a href='/NABRE/3/11/44'>LEV 11:44</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/23/1'>23:1-44</a>). The Christian community regarded its members as sanctified by baptism (<a href='/NABRE/45/6/22'>ROM 6:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/15/16'>15:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/6/11'>1CO 6:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/5/26'>EPH 5:26-27</a>). Christians are called to holiness (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/2'>1CO 1:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/4/7'>1TS 4:7</a>), that is, they are called to make their lives conform to the gift they have already received."
NABRE,45,1,8,"[6] In Greco-Roman letters, the greeting was customarily followed by a prayer. The Pauline letters usually include this element (except Galatians and 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy) expressed in Christian thanksgiving formulas and usually stating the principal theme of the letter. In 2 Corinthians the thanksgiving becomes a blessing, and in Ephesians it is preceded by a lengthy blessing. Sometimes the thanksgiving is blended into the body of the letter, especially in 1 Thessalonians. In Romans it is stated briefly."
NABRE,45,1,10,[7] 1:10-12 Paul lays the groundwork for his more detailed statement in <a href='/NABRE/45/15/22'>ROM 15:22-24</a> about his projected visit to Rome.
NABRE,45,1,13,"[8] Brothersis idiomatic for all Pauls ""kin in Christ,"" all those who believe in the gospel; it includes women as well as men (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/4/3'>ROM 4:3</a>)."
NABRE,45,1,14,"[9] Greeks and non-Greeks: literally, ""Greeks and barbarians."" As a result of Alexanders conquests, Greek became the standard international language of the Mediterranean world. Greeksin Pauls statement therefore means people who know Greek or who have been influenced by Greek culture. Non-Greekswere people whose cultures remained substantially unaffected by Greek influences. Greeks called such people ""barbarians"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/28/2'>ACT 28:2</a>), meaning people whose speech was foreign. Roman citizens would scarcely classify themselves as such, and Nero, who was reigning when Paul wrote this letter, prided himself on his admiration for Greek culture. Under obligation: Paul will expand on the theme of obligation in <a href='/NABRE/45/13/8'>ROM 13:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/15/1'>15:1, 27</a>."
NABRE,45,1,16,"[10] 1:16-17 The principal theme of the letter is salvation through faith. I am not ashamed of the gospel: Paul is not ashamed to proclaim the gospel, despite the criticism that Jews and Gentiles leveled against the proclamation of the crucified savior; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/1/23'>1CO 1:23-24</a>. Paul affirms, however, that it is precisely through the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus that Gods saving will and power become manifest. Jew first(cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/2/9'>ROM 2:9-10</a>) means that Jews especially, in view of the example of Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/45/4/1'>ROM 4</a>), ought to be the leaders in the response of faith."
NABRE,45,1,17,"[11] In it is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith: the gospel centers in Jesus Christ, in whom Gods saving presence and righteousness in history have been made known. Faith is affirmation of the basic purpose and meaning of the Old Testament as proclamation of divine promise (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/2'>ROM 1:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/4/13'>4:13</a>) and exposure of the inability of humanity to effect its salvation even through covenant law. Faith is the gift of the holy Spirit and denotes acceptance of salvation as Gods righteousness, that is, Gods gift of a renewed relationship in forgiveness and power for a new life. Faith is response to Gods total claim on people and their destiny. The one who is righteous by faith will live: see note on <a href='/NABRE/58/2/4'>HEB 2:4</a>."
NABRE,45,1,18,[12] 1:18-3:20 Paul aims to show that all humanity is in a desperate plight and requires Gods special intervention if it is to be saved.
NABRE,45,1,18,"[13] 1:18-32 In this passage Paul uses themes and rhetoric common in Jewish-Hellenistic mission proclamation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/13/1'>WIS 13:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/14/31'>14:31</a>) to indict especially the non-Jewish world. The close association of idolatry and immorality is basic, but the generalization needs in all fairness to be balanced against the fact that non-Jewish Christian society on many levels displayed moral attitudes and performance whose quality would challenge much of contemporary Christian culture. Romans themselves expressed abhorrence over devotion accorded to animals in Egypt. Pauls main point is that the wrath of God does not await the end of the world but goes into action at each present moment in humanitys history when misdirected piety serves as a facade for self-interest."
NABRE,45,1,18,"[14] The wrath of God: Gods reaction to human sinfulness, an Old Testament phrase that expresses the irreconcilable opposition between God and evil (see <a href='/NABRE/23/9/11'>ISA 9:11, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/9/18'>18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/9/20'>20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/10/4'>10:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/30/27'>30:27</a>). It is not contrary to Gods universal love for his creatures, but condemns Israels turning aside from the covenant obligations. Hosea depicts Yahweh as suffering intensely at the thought of having to punish Israel (<a href='/NABRE/28/11/8'>HOS 11:8-9</a>). Gods wrath was to be poured forth especially on the ""Day of Yahweh"" and thus took on an eschatological connotation (see <a href='/NABRE/36/1/15'>ZEP 1:15</a>)."
NABRE,45,1,24,"[15] In order to expose the depth of humanitys rebellion against the Creator, God handed them over to impurity through the lusts of their hearts. Instead of curbing peoples evil interests, God abandoned them to self-indulgence, thereby removing the facade of apparent conformity to the divine will. Subsequently Paul will show that the Mosaic law produces the same effect; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/5/20'>ROM 5:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/7/13'>7:13-24</a>. The divine judgment expressed here is related to the theme of hardness of heart described in <a href='/NABRE/45/9/17'>ROM 9:17-18</a>."
NABRE,45,2,1,"[1] 2:1-3:20 After his general indictment of the Gentile, Paul shows that in spite of special revelation Jews enjoy no advantage in moral status before God (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/1'>ROM 3:1-8</a>). With the entire human race now declared guilty before God (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/9'>ROM 3:9-20</a>), Paul will then be able to display the solution for the total problem: salvation through Gods redemptive work that is revealed in Christ Jesus for all who believe (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/21'>ROM 3:21-31</a>)."
NABRE,45,2,1,"[2] 2:1-11 As a first step in his demonstration that Jews enjoy no real moral supremacy over Gentiles, Paul explains that the final judgment will be a review of performance, not of privilege. From this perspective Gentiles stand on an equal footing with Jews, and Jews cannot condemn the sins of Gentiles without condemning themselves."
NABRE,45,2,6,[3] Will repay everyone according to his works: Paul reproduces the Septuagint text of <a href='/NABRE/19/62/12'>PS 62:12</a> and <a href='/NABRE/20/24/12'>PRO 24:12</a>.
NABRE,45,2,11,"[4] No partiality with God: this sentence is not at variance with the statements in <a href='/NABRE/45/2/9'>ROM 2:9-10</a>. Since Jews are the first to go under indictment, it is only fair that they be given first consideration in the distribution of blessings. Basic, of course, is the understanding that God accepts no bribes (<a href='/NABRE/5/10/17'>DEU 10:17</a>)."
NABRE,45,2,11,"[5] 2:12-16 Jews cannot reasonably demand from Gentiles the standard of conduct inculcated in the Old Testament since God did not address its revelation to them. Rather, God made it possible for Gentiles to know instinctively the difference between right and wrong. But, as Paul explained in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/18'>ROM 1:18-32</a>, humanity misread the evidence of Gods existence, power, and divinity, and ""while claiming to be wise, they became fools"" (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/22'>ROM 1:22</a>)."
NABRE,45,2,15,[6] Paul expands on the thought of <a href='/NABRE/24/31/33'>JER 31:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/17/11'>WIS 17:11</a>.
NABRE,45,2,16,"[7] 2:17-29 Mere possession of laws is no evidence of virtue. By eliminating circumcision as an elitist moral sign, Paul clears away the last obstacle to his presentation of justification through faith without claims based on the receipt of circumcision and its attendant legal obligations."
NABRE,45,2,24,[8] According to <a href='/NABRE/23/52/5'>ISA 52:5</a> the suffering of Israel prompts her enemies to revile God. Paul uses the passage in support of his point that the present immorality of Israelites is the cause of such defamation.
NABRE,45,3,1,"[1] 3:1-4 In keeping with the popular style of diatribe, Paul responds to the objection that his teaching on the sinfulness of all humanity detracts from the religious prerogatives of Israel. He stresses that Jews have remained the vehicle of Gods revelation despite their sins, though this depends on the fidelity of God."
NABRE,45,3,4,[2] Though every human being is a liar: these words reproduce the Greek text of <a href='/NABRE/19/116/11'>PS 116:11</a>. The rest of the verse is from <a href='/NABRE/19/51/6'>PS 51:6</a>.
NABRE,45,3,8,"[3] 3:9-20 Well, then, are we better off?: this phrase can also be translated ""Are we at a disadvantage?"" but the latter version does not substantially change the overall meaning of the passage. Having explained that Israels privileged status is guaranteed by Gods fidelity, Paul now demonstrates the infidelity of the Jews by a catena of citations from scripture, possibly derived from an existing collection of testimonia. These texts show that all human beings share the common burden of sin. They are linked together by mention of organs of the body: throat, tongue, lips, mouth, feet, eyes."
NABRE,45,3,19,[4] The law: Paul here uses the term in its broadest sense to mean all of the scriptures; none of the preceding texts is from the Torah or Pentateuch.
NABRE,45,3,20,"[5] No human being will be justified in his sight: these words are freely cited from <a href='/NABRE/19/143/2'>PS 143:2</a>. In place of the psalmists ""no living person,"" Paul substitutes ""no human being"" (literally ""no flesh,"" a Hebraism), and he adds ""by observing the law."""
NABRE,45,3,21,"[6] 3:21-31 These verses provide a clear statement of Pauls ""gospel,"" i.e., the principle of justification by faith in Christ. God has found a means of rescuing humanity from its desperate plight: Pauls general term for this divine initiative is the righteousness of God (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/21'>ROM 3:21</a>). Divine mercy declares the guilty innocent and makes them so. God does this not as a result of the law but apart from it (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/21'>ROM 3:21</a>), and not because of any merit in human beings but through forgiveness of their sins (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/24'>ROM 3:24</a>), in virtue of the redemption wrought in Christ Jesus for all who believe (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/22'>ROM 3:22</a>, <a href='/NABRE/45/3/24'>24-25</a>). God has manifested his righteousness in the coming of Jesus Christ, whose saving activity inaugurates a new era in human history."
NABRE,45,3,21,[7] But now: Paul adopts a common phrase used by Greek authors to describe movement from disaster to prosperity. The expressions indicate that <a href='/NABRE/45/3/21'>ROM 3:21-26</a> are the consolatory answer to <a href='/NABRE/45/3/9'>ROM 3:9-20</a>.
NABRE,45,3,25,"[8] Expiation: this rendering is preferable to ""propitiation,"" which suggests hostility on the part of God toward sinners. As Paul will be at pains to point out (<a href='/NABRE/45/5/8'>ROM 5:8-10</a>), it is humanity that is hostile to God."
NABRE,45,3,27,"[9] 3:27-31 People cannot boast of their own holiness, since it is Gods free gift (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/27'>ROM 3:27</a>), both to the Jew who practices circumcision out of faith and to the Gentile who accepts faith without the Old Testament religious culture symbolized by circumcision (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/29'>ROM 3:29-30</a>)."
NABRE,45,3,27,"[10] Principle of faith: literally, ""law of faith."" Paul is fond of wordplay involving the term ""law""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/7/21'>ROM 7:21, 23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/8/2'>8:2</a>. Since ""law"" in Greek may also connote ""custom"" or ""principle,"" his readers and hearers would have sensed no contradiction in the use of the term after the negative statement concerning law in <a href='/NABRE/45/3/20'>ROM 3:20</a>."
NABRE,45,3,31,"[11] We are supporting the law: giving priority to Gods intentions. God is the ultimate source of law, and the essence of law is fairness. On the basis of the Mosaic covenant, Gods justice is in question if those who sinned against the law are permitted to go free (see <a href='/NABRE/45/3/23'>ROM 3:23-26</a>). In order to rescue all humanity rather than condemn it, God thinks of an alternative: the law or ""principle"" of faith (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/27'>ROM 3:27</a>). What can be more fair than to admit everyone into the divine presence on the basis of forgiveness grasped by faith? Indeed, this principle of faith antedates the Mosaic law, as Paul will demonstrate in <a href='/NABRE/45/4/1'>ROM 4</a>, and does not therefore mark a change in divine policy."
NABRE,45,4,2,"[1] 4:2-5 <a href='/NABRE/45/4/2'>ROM 4:2</a> corresponds to <a href='/NABRE/45/4/4'>ROM 4:4</a>, and <a href='/NABRE/45/4/3'>ROM 4:3-5</a>. The Greek term here rendered creditedmeans ""made an entry."" The context determines whether it is credit or debit. <a href='/NABRE/45/4/8'>ROM 4:8</a> speaks of ""recording sin"" as a debit. Pauls repeated use of accountants terminology in this and other passages can be traced both to the Old Testament texts he quotes and to his business activity as a tentmaker. The commercial term in <a href='/NABRE/1/15/6'>GEN 15:6</a>, ""credited it to him,"" reminds Paul in <a href='/NABRE/45/4/7'>ROM 4:7-8</a> of <a href='/NABRE/19/32/2'>PS 32:2</a>, in which the same term is used and applied to forgiveness of sins. Thus Paul is able to argue that Abrahams faith involved receipt of forgiveness of sins and that all believers benefit as he did through faith."
NABRE,45,4,3,"[2] <a href='/NABRE/59/2/24'>JAM 2:24</a> appears to conflict with Pauls statement. However, James combats the error of extremists who used the doctrine of justification through faith as a screen for moral self-determination. Paul discusses the subject of holiness in greater detail than does James and beginning with <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>ROM 6</a> shows how justification through faith introduces one to the gift of a new life in Christ through the power of the holy Spirit."
NABRE,45,4,9,[3] Blessedness: evidence of divine favor.
NABRE,45,4,15,[4] Law has the negative function of bringing the deep-seated rebellion against God to the surface in specific sins; see note on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/18'>ROM 1:18-32</a>.
NABRE,45,4,20,[5] He did not doubt Gods promise in unbelief: any doubts Abraham might have had were resolved in commitment to Gods promise. <a href='/NABRE/58/11/8'>HEB 11:8-12</a> emphasizes the faith of Abraham and Sarah.
NABRE,45,5,1,"[1] 5:1-11 Popular piety frequently construed reverses and troubles as punishment for sin; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/9/2'>JHN 9:2</a>. Paul therefore assures believers that Gods justifying action in Jesus Christ is a declaration of peace. The crucifixion of Jesus Christ displays Gods initiative in certifying humanity for unimpeded access into the divine presence. Reconciliation is Gods gift of pardon to the entire human race. Through faith one benefits personally from this pardon or, in Pauls term, is justified. The ultimate aim of God is to liberate believers from the pre-Christian self as described in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/3/1'>3</a>. Since this liberation will first find completion in the believers resurrection, salvation is described as future in <a href='/NABRE/45/5/10'>ROM 5:10</a>. Because this fullness of salvation belongs to the future it is called the Christian hope. Pauls Greek term for hope does not, however, suggest a note of uncertainty, to the effect: ""I wonder whether God really means it."" Rather, Gods promise in the gospel fills believers with expectation and anticipation for the climactic gift of unalloyed commitment in the holy Spirit to the performance of the will of God. The persecutions that attend Christian commitment are to teach believers patience and to strengthen this hope, which will not disappoint them because the holy Spirit dwells in their hearts and imbues them with Gods love (<a href='/NABRE/45/5/5'>ROM 5:5</a>)."
NABRE,45,5,1,"[2] We have peace: a number of manuscripts, versions, and church Fathers read ""Let us have peace""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/14/19'>ROM 14:19</a>."
NABRE,45,5,7,[3] In the world of Pauls time the good personis especially one who is magnanimous to others.
NABRE,45,5,12,"[4] 5:12-21 Paul reflects on the sin of Adam (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>GEN 3:1-13</a>) in the light of the redemptive mystery of Christ. Sin, as used in the singular by Paul, refers to the dreadful power that has gripped humanity, which is now in revolt against the Creator and engaged in the exaltation of its own desires and interests. But no one has a right to say, ""Adam made me do it,"" for all are culpable (<a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>ROM 5:12</a>): Gentiles under the demands of the law written in their hearts (<a href='/NABRE/45/2/14'>ROM 2:14-15</a>), and Jews under the Mosaic covenant. Through the Old Testament law, the sinfulness of humanity that was operative from the beginning (<a href='/NABRE/45/5/13'>ROM 5:13</a>) found further stimulation, with the result that sins were generated in even greater abundance. According to <a href='/NABRE/45/5/15'>ROM 5:15-21</a>, Gods act in Christ is in total contrast to the disastrous effects of the virus of sin that invaded humanity through Adams crime."
NABRE,45,5,12,"[5] Inasmuch as all sinned: others translate ""because all sinned,"" and understand <a href='/NABRE/45/5/13'>ROM 5:13</a> as a parenthetical remark. Unlike <a href='/NABRE/70/2/24'>WIS 2:24</a>, Paul does not ascribe the entry of death to the devil."
NABRE,45,5,20,"[6] The law entered in: sin had made its entrance (<a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>ROM 5:12</a>); now the law comes in alongside sin. See notes on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/18'>ROM 1:18-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>5:12-21</a>. Where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more: Paul declares that grace outmatches the productivity of sin."
NABRE,45,6,1,"[1] 6:1-11 To defend the gospel against the charge that it promotes moral laxity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/3/5'>ROM 3:5-8</a>), Paul expresses himself in the typical style of spirited diatribe. Gods display of generosity or grace is not evoked by sin but, as stated in <a href='/NABRE/45/5/8'>ROM 5:8</a> is the expression of Gods love, and this love pledges eternal life to all believers (<a href='/NABRE/45/5/21'>ROM 5:21</a>). Paul views the present conduct of the believers from the perspective of Gods completed salvation when the body is resurrected and directed totally by the holy Spirit. Through baptism believers share the death of Christ and thereby escape from the grip of sin. Through the resurrection of Christ the power to live anew becomes reality for them, but the fullness of participation in Christs resurrection still lies in the future. But life that is lived in dedication to God now is part and parcel of that future. Hence anyone who sincerely claims to be interested in that future will scarcely be able to say, ""Let us sin so that grace may prosper"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>ROM 6:1</a>)."
NABRE,45,6,12,"[2] 6:12-19 Christians have been released from the grip of sin, but sin endeavors to reclaim its victims. The antidote is constant remembrance that divine grace has claimed them and identifies them as people who are alive only for Gods interests."
NABRE,45,6,17,"[3] In contrast to humanity, which was handed over to self-indulgence (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/24'>ROM 1:24-32</a>), believers are entrusted(""handed over"") to Gods pattern of teaching, that is, the new life God aims to develop in Christians through the productivity of the holy Spirit. Throughout this passage Paul uses the slave-master model in order to emphasize the fact that one cannot give allegiance to both God and sin."
NABRE,45,6,20,"[4] You were free from righteousness: expressed ironically, for such freedom is really tyranny. The commercial metaphors in <a href='/NABRE/45/6/21'>ROM 6:21-23</a> add up only one way: sin is a bad bargain."
NABRE,45,6,22,[5] Sanctification: or holiness.
NABRE,45,7,1,"[1] 7:1-6 Paul reflects on the fact that Christians have a different understanding of the law because of their faith in Christ. Law binds the living, not the dead, as exemplified in marriage, which binds in life but is dissolved through death. Similarly, Christians who through baptism have died with Christ to sin (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/2'>ROM 6:2-4</a>) are freed from the law that occasioned transgressions, which in turn were productive of death. Now that Christians are joined to Christ, the power of Christs resurrection makes it possible for them to bear the fruit of newness of life for God."
NABRE,45,7,7,[2] 7:7-25 In this passage Paul uses the first person singular in the style of diatribe for the sake of argument. He aims to depict the disastrous consequences when a Christian reintroduces the law as a means to attain the objective of holiness pronounced in <a href='/NABRE/45/6/22'>ROM 6:22</a>.
NABRE,45,7,7,"[3] 7:7-12 The apostle defends himself against the charge of identifying the law with sin. Sin does not exist in law but in human beings, whose sinful inclinations are not overcome by the proclamation of law."
NABRE,45,7,12,"[4] 7:13-25 Far from improving the sinner, law encourages sin to expose itself in transgressions or violations of specific commandments (see <a href='/NABRE/45/1/24'>ROM 1:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/5/20'>5:20</a>). Thus persons who do not experience the justifying grace of God, and Christians who revert to dependence on law as the criterion for their relationship with God, will recognize a rift between their reasoned desire for the goodness of the law and their actual performance that is contrary to the law. Unable to free themselves from the slavery of sin and the power of death, they can only be rescued from defeat in the conflict by the power of Gods grace working through Jesus Christ."
NABRE,45,7,23,"[5] As in <a href='/NABRE/45/3/27'>ROM 3:27</a>, Paul plays on the term law, which in Greek can connote custom, system, or principle."
NABRE,45,8,1,"[1] 8:1-13 After his warning in <a href='/NABRE/45/7/1'>ROM 7</a> against the wrong route to fulfillment of the objective of holiness expressed in <a href='/NABRE/45/6/22'>ROM 6:22</a>, Paul points his addressees to the correct way. Through the redemptive work of Christ, Christians have been liberated from the terrible forces of sin and death. Holiness was impossible so long as the flesh(or our ""old self""), that is, self-interested hostility toward God (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/7'>ROM 8:7</a>), frustrated the divine objectives expressed in the law. What is worse, sin used the law to break forth into all manner of lawlessness (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/8'>ROM 8:8</a>). All this is now changed. At the cross God broke the power of sin and pronounced sentence on it (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/3'>ROM 8:3</a>). Christians still retain the flesh, but it is alien to their new being, which is life in the spirit, namely the new self, governed by the holy Spirit. Under the direction of the holy Spirit Christians are able to fulfill the divine will that formerly found expression in the law (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/4'>ROM 8:4</a>). The same Spirit who enlivens Christians for holiness will also resurrect their bodies at the last day (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/11'>ROM 8:11</a>). Christian life is therefore the experience of a constant challenge to put to death the evil deeds of the body through life of the spirit (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/13'>ROM 8:13</a>)."
NABRE,45,8,13,"[2] 8:14-17 Christians, by reason of the Spirits presence within them, enjoy not only new life but also a new relationship to God, that of adopted children and heirs through Christ, whose sufferings and glory they share."
NABRE,45,8,15,[3] Abba: see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/14/36'>MAK 14:36</a>.
NABRE,45,8,17,"[4] 8:18-27 The glory that believers are destined to share with Christ far exceeds the sufferings of the present life. Paul considers the destiny of the created world to be linked with the future that belongs to the believers. As it shares in the penalty of corruption brought about by sin, so also will it share in the benefits of redemption and future glory that comprise the ultimate liberation of Gods people (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/19'>ROM 8:19-22</a>). After patient endurance in steadfast expectation, the full harvest of the Spirits presence will be realized. On earth believers enjoy the firstfruits, i.e., the Spirit, as a guarantee of the total liberation of their bodies from the influence of the rebellious old self (<a href='/NABRE/45/8/23'>ROM 8:23</a>)."
NABRE,45,8,28,"[5] 8:28-30 These verses outline the Christian vocation as it was designed by God: to be conformed to the image of his Son, who is to be the firstborn among many brothers(<a href='/NABRE/45/8/29'>ROM 8:29</a>). Gods redemptive action on behalf of the believers has been in process before the beginning of the world. Those whom God chooses are those he foreknew(<a href='/NABRE/45/8/29'>ROM 8:29</a>) or elected. Those who are called(<a href='/NABRE/45/8/30'>ROM 8:30</a>) are predestinedor predetermined. These expressions do not mean that God is arbitrary. Rather, Paul uses them to emphasize the thought and care that God has taken for the Christians salvation."
NABRE,45,8,28,"[6] We know that all things work for good for those who love God: a few ancient authorities have God as the subject of the verb, and some translators render: ""We know that God makes everything work for good for those who love God…."""
NABRE,45,8,29,"[7] Image: while man and woman were originally created in Gods image (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/26'>GEN 1:26-27</a>), it is through baptism into Christ, the image of God (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/4'>2CO 4:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/1/15'>COL 1:15</a>), that we are renewed according to the image of the Creator (<a href='/NABRE/51/3/10'>COL 3:10</a>)."
NABRE,45,8,31,[8] 8:31-39 The all-conquering power of Gods love has overcome every obstacle to Christians salvation and every threat to separate them from God. That power manifested itself fully when Gods own Son was delivered up to death for their salvation. Through him Christians can overcome all their afflictions and trials.
NABRE,45,8,38,[9] Present thingsand future thingsmay refer to astrological data. Paul appears to be saying that the gospel liberates believers from dependence on astrologers.
NABRE,45,8,39,"[10] Height, depthmay refer to positions in the zodiac, positions of heavenly bodies relative to the horizon. In astrological documents the term for ""height"" means ""exaltation"" or the position of greatest influence exerted by a planet. Since hostile spirits were associated with the planets and stars, Paul includes powers(<a href='/NABRE/45/8/38'>ROM 8:38</a>) in his list of malevolent forces."
NABRE,45,9,1,"[1] 9:1-11:36 Israels unbelief and its rejection of Jesus as savior astonished and puzzled Christians. It constituted a serious problem for them in view of Gods specific preparation of Israel for the advent of the Messiah. Paul addresses himself here to the essential question of how the divine plan could be frustrated by Israels unbelief. At the same time, he discourages both complacency and anxiety on the part of Gentiles. To those who might boast of their superior advantage over Jews, he warns that their enjoyment of the blessings assigned to Israel can be terminated. To those who might anxiously ask, ""How can we be sure that Israels fate will not be ours?"" he replies that only unbelief can deprive one of salvation."
NABRE,45,9,1,[2] 9:1-5 The apostle speaks in strong terms of the depth of his grief over the unbelief of his own people. He would willingly undergo a curse himself for the sake of their coming to the knowledge of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/45/9/3'>ROM 9:3</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/27/28'>LEV 27:28-29</a>). His love for them derives from Gods continuing choice of them and from the spiritual benefits that God bestows on them and through them on all of humanity (<a href='/NABRE/45/9/4'>ROM 9:4-5</a>).
NABRE,45,9,5,"[3] Some editors punctuate this verse differently and prefer the translation, ""Of whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is God over all."" However, Pauls point is that God who is over allaimed to use Israel, which had been entrusted with every privilege, in outreach to the entire world through the Messiah."
NABRE,45,9,10,"[4] Children by one husband, our father Isaac: Abraham had two children, Ishmael and Isaac, by two wives, Hagar and Sarah, respectively. In that instance Isaac, although born later than Ishmael, became the bearer of the messianic promise. In the case of twins born to Rebecca, Gods elective procedure is seen even more dramatically, and again the younger, contrary to Semitic custom, is given the preference."
NABRE,45,9,13,"[5] The literal rendering, ""Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,""suggests an attitude of divine hostility that is not implied in Pauls statement. In Semitic usage ""hate"" means to love less; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/14/26'>LUK 14:26</a> with <a href='/NABRE/40/10/37'>MAT 10:37</a>. Israels unbelief reflects the mystery of the divine election that is always operative within it. Mere natural descent from Abraham does not ensure the full possession of the divine gifts; it is Gods sovereign prerogative to bestow this fullness upon, or to withhold it from, whomsoever he wishes; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/3/9'>MAT 3:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/8/39'>JHN 8:39</a>. The choice of Jacob over Esau is a case in point."
NABRE,45,9,14,"[6] 9:14-18 The principle of divine election does not invite Christians to theoretical inquiry concerning the nonelected, nor does this principle mean that God is unfair in his dealings with humanity. The instruction concerning divine election is a part of the gospel and reveals that the gift of faith is the enactment of Gods mercy (<a href='/NABRE/45/9/16'>ROM 9:16</a>). God raised up Moses to display that mercy, and Pharaoh to display divine severity in punishing those who obstinately oppose their Creator."
NABRE,45,9,18,"[7] The basic biblical principle is: those who will not see or hear shallnot see or hear. On the other hand, the same God who thus makes stubborn or hardens the heart can reconstruct it through the work of the holy Spirit."
NABRE,45,9,19,"[8] 9:19-29 The apostle responds to the objection that if God rules over faith through the principle of divine election, God cannot then accuse unbelievers of sin (<a href='/NABRE/45/9/19'>ROM 9:19</a>). For Paul, this objection is in the last analysis a manifestation of human insolence, and his ""answer"" is less an explanation of Gods ways than the rejection of an argument that places humanity on a level with God. At the same time, Paul shows that God is far less arbitrary than appearances suggest, for God endures with much patience(<a href='/NABRE/45/9/22'>ROM 9:22</a>) a person like the Pharaoh of the Exodus."
NABRE,45,9,25,"[9] Beloved: in Semitic discourse means ""preferred"" or ""favorite"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/9/13'>ROM 9:13</a>). See <a href='/NABRE/28/2/1'>HOS 2:1</a>."
NABRE,45,9,29,"[10] 9:30-33 In the conversion of the Gentiles and, by contrast, of relatively few Jews, the Old Testament prophecies are seen to be fulfilled; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/9/25'>ROM 9:25-29</a>. Israel feared that the doctrine of justification through faith would jeopardize the validity of the Mosaic law, and so they never reached their goal of righteousness that they had sought to attain through meticulous observance of the law (<a href='/NABRE/45/9/31'>ROM 9:31</a>). Since Gentiles, including especially Greeks and Romans, had a great regard for righteousness, Pauls statement concerning Gentiles in <a href='/NABRE/45/9/30'>ROM 9:30</a> is to be understood from a Jewish perspective: quite evidently they had not been interested in ""Gods"" righteousness, for it had not been revealed to them; but now in response to the proclamation of the gospel they respond in faith."
NABRE,45,9,32,[11] Paul discusses Israel as a whole from the perspective of contemporary Jewish rejection of Jesus as Messiah. The Old Testament and much of Jewish noncanonical literature in fact reflect a fervent faith in divine mercy.
NABRE,45,10,1,"[1] 10:1-13 Despite Israels lack of faith in Gods act in Christ, Paul does not abandon hope for her salvation (<a href='/NABRE/45/10/1'>ROM 10:1</a>). However, Israel must recognize that the Messiahs arrival in the person of Jesus Christ means the termination of the Mosaic law as the criterion for understanding oneself in a valid relationship to God. Faith in Gods saving action in Jesus Christ takes precedence over any such legal claim (<a href='/NABRE/45/10/6'>ROM 10:6</a>)."
NABRE,45,10,4,"[2] The Mosaic legislation has been superseded by Gods action in Jesus Christ. Others understand end here in the sense that Christ is the goal of the law, i.e., the true meaning of the Mosaic law, which cannot be correctly understood apart from him. Still others believe that both meanings are intended."
NABRE,45,10,5,"[3] 10:5-6 The subject of the verb says(<a href='/NABRE/45/10/6'>ROM 10:6</a>) is righteousnesspersonified. Both of the statements in <a href='/NABRE/45/10/5'>ROM 10:5, 6</a> derive from Moses, but Paul wishes to contrast the language of law and the language of faith."
NABRE,45,10,7,[4] Here Paul blends <a href='/NABRE/5/30/13'>DEU 30:13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/19/107/26'>PS 107:26</a>.
NABRE,45,10,9,"[5] 10:9-11 To confess Jesus as Lord was frequently quite hazardous in the first century (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/10/18'>MAT 10:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/2/2'>1TS 2:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/2/18'>1PE 2:18-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/3/14'>3:14</a>). For a Jew it could mean disruption of normal familial and other social relationships, including great economic sacrifice. In the face of penalties imposed by the secular world, Christians are assured that no one who believes inJesus will be put to shame(<a href='/NABRE/45/10/11'>ROM 10:11</a>)."
NABRE,45,10,14,"[6] 10:14-21 The gospel has been sufficiently proclaimed to Israel, and Israel has adequately understood Gods plan for the messianic age, which would see the gospel brought to the uttermost parts of the earth. As often in the past, Israel has not accepted the prophetic message; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/7/51'>ACT 7:51-53</a>."
NABRE,45,10,15,"[7] How beautiful are the feet of those who bring [the] good news: in Semitic fashion, the parts of the body that bring the messenger with welcome news are praised; cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/11/27'>LUK 11:27</a>."
NABRE,45,11,1,"[1] 11:1-10 Although Israel has been unfaithful to the prophetic message of the gospel (<a href='/NABRE/45/10/14'>ROM 10:14-21</a>), God remains faithful to Israel. Proof of the divine fidelity lies in the existence of Jewish Christians like Paul himself. The unbelieving Jews, says Paul, have been blinded by the Christian teaching concerning the Messiah."
NABRE,45,11,11,"[2] 11:11-15 The unbelief of the Jews has paved the way for the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles and for their easier acceptance of it outside the context of Jewish culture. Through his mission to the Gentiles Paul also hopes to fill his fellow Jews with jealousy. Hence he hastens to fill the entire Mediterranean world with the gospel. Once all the Gentile nations have heard the gospel, Israel as a whole is expected to embrace it. This will be tantamount to resurrection of the dead, that is, the reappearance of Jesus Christ with all the believers at the end of time."
NABRE,45,11,16,"[3] 11:16-24 Israel remains holy in the eyes of God and stands as a witness to the faith described in the Old Testament because of the firstfruits(or the first piece baked) (<a href='/NABRE/45/11/16'>ROM 11:16</a>), that is, the converted remnant, and the rootthat is holy, that is, the patriarchs (<a href='/NABRE/45/11/16'>ROM 11:16</a>). The Jews failure to believe in Christ is a warning to Gentile Christians to be on guard against any semblance of anti-Jewish arrogance, that is, failure to recognize their total dependence on divine grace."
NABRE,45,11,24,"[4] 11:25-29 In Gods design, Israels unbelief is being used to grant the light of faith to the Gentiles. Meanwhile, Israel remains dear to God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/9/13'>ROM 9:13</a>), still the object of special providence, the mystery of which will one day be revealed."
NABRE,45,11,30,"[5] 11:30-32 Israel, together with the Gentiles who have been handed over to all manner of vices (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1</a>), has been delivered…to disobedience. The conclusion of <a href='/NABRE/45/11/32'>ROM 11:32</a> repeats the thought of <a href='/NABRE/45/5/20'>ROM 5:20</a>, ""Where sin increased, grace overflowed all the more."""
NABRE,45,11,33,"[6] 11:33-36 This final reflection celebrates the wisdom of Gods plan of salvation. As Paul has indicated throughout these chapters, both Jew and Gentile, despite the religious recalcitrance of each, have received the gift of faith. The methods used by God in making this outreach to the world stagger human comprehension but are at the same time a dazzling invitation to abiding faith."
NABRE,45,11,34,"[7] The citation is from the Greek text of <a href='/NABRE/23/40/13'>ISA 40:13</a>. Paul does not explicitly mention Isaiah in this verse, nor Job in <a href='/NABRE/45/11/35'>ROM 11:35</a>."
NABRE,45,11,35,"[8] Paul quotes from an old Greek version of <a href='/NABRE/18/41/3'>JOB 41:3</a>a, which differs from the Hebrew text (<a href='/NABRE/18/41/11'>JOB 41:11</a>a)."
NABRE,45,12,1,"[1] 12:1-13:14 Since Christ marks the termination of the Mosaic law as the primary source of guidance for Gods people (<a href='/NABRE/45/10/4'>ROM 10:4</a>), the apostle explains how Christians can function, in the light of the gift of justification through faith, in their relation to one another and the state."
NABRE,45,12,1,"[2] 12:1-8 The Mosaic code included elaborate directions on sacrifices and other cultic observances. The gospel, however, invites believers to present their bodies as a living sacrifice(<a href='/NABRE/45/12/1'>ROM 12:1</a>). Instead of being limited by specific legal maxims, Christians are liberated for the exercise of good judgment as they are confronted with the many and varied decisions required in the course of daily life. To assist them, God distributes a variety of gifts to the fellowship of believers, including those of prophecy, teaching, and exhortation (<a href='/NABRE/45/12/6'>ROM 12:6-8</a>). Prophets assist the community to understand the will of God as it applies to the present situation (<a href='/NABRE/45/12/6'>ROM 12:6</a>). Teachers help people to understand themselves and their responsibilities in relation to others (<a href='/NABRE/45/12/7'>ROM 12:7</a>). One who exhortsoffers encouragement to the community to exercise their faith in the performance of all that is pleasing to God (<a href='/NABRE/45/12/8'>ROM 12:8</a>). Indeed, this very section, beginning with <a href='/NABRE/45/12/1'>ROM 12:1</a>, is a specimen of Pauls own style of exhortation."
NABRE,45,12,5,"[3] One body in Christ: on the church as the body of Christ, see <a href='/NABRE/46/12/12'>1CO 12:12-27</a>."
NABRE,45,12,6,"[4] Everyone has some gift that can be used for the benefit of the community. When the instruction on justification through faith is correctly grasped, the possessor of a gift will understand that it is not an instrument of self-aggrandizement. Possession of a gift is not an index to quality of faith. Rather, the gift is a challenge to faithful use."
NABRE,45,12,8,"[5] Over others: usually taken to mean ""rule over"" but possibly ""serve as a patron."" Wealthier members in Greco-Roman communities were frequently asked to assist in public service projects. In view of the references to contributing in generosityand to acts of mercy, Paul may have in mind people like Phoebe (<a href='/NABRE/45/16/1'>ROM 16:1-2</a>), who is called a benefactor(or ""patron"") because of the services she rendered to many Christians, including Paul."
NABRE,45,12,14,"[6] 12:14-21 Since God has justified the believers, it is not necessary for them to take justice into their own hands by taking vengeance. God will ultimately deal justly with all, including those who inflict injury on the believers. This question of personal rights as a matter of justice prepares the way for more detailed consideration of the state as adjudicator."
NABRE,45,13,1,"[1] 13:1-7 Paul must come to grips with the problem raised by a message that declares people free from the law. How are they to relate to Roman authority? The problem was exacerbated by the fact that imperial protocol was interwoven with devotion to various deities. Paul builds on the traditional instruction exhibited in <a href='/NABRE/70/6/1'>WIS 6:1-3</a>, according to which kings and magistrates rule by consent of God. From this perspective, then, believers who render obedience to the governing authorities are obeying the one who is highest in command. At the same time, it is recognized that Caesar has the responsibility to make just ordinances and to commend uprightness; cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/6/4'>WIS 6:4-21</a>. That Caesar is not entitled to obedience when such obedience would nullify Gods prior claim to the believers moral decision becomes clear in the light of the following verses."
NABRE,45,13,7,"[2] 13:8-10 When love directs the Christians moral decisions, the interest of law in basic concerns, such as familial relationships, sanctity of life, and security of property, is safeguarded (<a href='/NABRE/45/13/9'>ROM 13:9</a>). Indeed, says Paul, the same applies to any other commandment(<a href='/NABRE/45/13/9'>ROM 13:9</a>), whether one in the Mosaic code or one drawn up by local magistrates under imperial authority. Love anticipates the purpose of public legislation, namely, to secure the best interests of the citizenry. Since Caesars obligation is to punish the wrongdoer (<a href='/NABRE/45/13/4'>ROM 13:4</a>), the Christian who acts in love is free from all legitimate indictment."
NABRE,45,13,10,[3] 13:11-14 These verses provide the motivation for the love that is encouraged in <a href='/NABRE/45/13/8'>ROM 13:8-10</a>.
NABRE,45,13,13,[4] Let us conduct ourselves properly as in the day: the behavior described in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/29'>ROM 1:29-30</a> is now to be reversed. Secular moralists were fond of making references to people who could not wait for nightfall to do their carousing. Paul says that Christians claim to be people of the new day that will dawn with the return of Christ. Instead of planning for nighttime behavior they should be concentrating on conduct that is consonant with avowed interest in the Lords return.
NABRE,45,14,1,"[1] 14:1-15:6 Since Christ spells termination of the law, which included observance of specific days and festivals as well as dietary instruction, the jettisoning of long-practiced customs was traumatic for many Christians brought up under the Mosaic code. Although Paul acknowledges that in principle no food is a source of moral contamination (<a href='/NABRE/45/14/14'>ROM 14:14</a>), he recommends that the consciences of Christians who are scrupulous in this regard be respected by other Christians (<a href='/NABRE/45/14/21'>ROM 14:21</a>). On the other hand, those who have scruples are not to sit in judgment on those who know that the gospel has liberated them from such ordinances (<a href='/NABRE/45/14/10'>ROM 14:10</a>). See <a href='/NABRE/46/8/1'>1CO 8</a>; 10."
NABRE,45,14,5,"[2] Since the problem to be overcome was humanitys perverted mind or judgment (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/28'>ROM 1:28</a>), Paul indicates that the mind of the Christian is now able to function with appropriate discrimination (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/12/2'>ROM 12:2</a>)."
NABRE,45,14,8,"[3] The Lord: Jesus, our Master. The same Greek word, kyrios, was applied to both rulers and holders of slaves. Throughout the Letter to the Romans Paul emphasizes Gods total claim on the believer; see note on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1:1</a>."
NABRE,45,14,19,"[4] Some manuscripts, versions, and church Fathers read, ""We then pursue…""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/5/1'>ROM 5:1</a>."
NABRE,45,14,23,[5] Whatever is not from faith is sin: Paul does not mean that all the actions of unbelievers are sinful. He addresses himself to the question of intracommunity living. Sinin the singular is the dreadful power described in <a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>ROM 5:12-14</a>.
NABRE,45,15,3,"[1] Liberation from the law of Moses does not make the scriptures of the old covenant irrelevant. Much consolation and motivation for Christian living can be derived from the Old Testament, as in the citation from <a href='/NABRE/19/69/10'>PS 69:10</a>. Because this psalm is quoted several times in the New Testament, it has been called indirectly messianic."
NABRE,45,15,5,[2] Think in harmony: a Greco-Roman ideal. Not rigid uniformity of thought and expression but thoughtful consideration of other peoples views finds expression here.
NABRE,45,15,6,[3] 15:7-13 True oneness of mind is found in pondering the ultimate mission of the church: to bring it about that Gods name be glorified throughout the world and that Jesus Christ be universally recognized as Gods gift to all humanity. Paul here prepares his addressees for the climactic appeal he is about to make.
NABRE,45,15,10,[4] Pauls citation of <a href='/NABRE/5/32/43'>DEU 32:43</a> follows the Greek version.
NABRE,45,15,14,"[5] 15:14-33 Paul sees himself as apostle and benefactor in the priestly service of the gospel and so sketches plans for a mission in Spain, supported by those in Rome."

NABRE,45,15,19,[7] Illyricum: Roman province northwest of Greece on the eastern shore of the Adriatic.
NABRE,45,15,20,"[8] I aspire: Paul uses terminology customarily applied to philanthropists. Unlike some philanthropists of his time, Paul does not engage in cheap competition for public acclaim. This explanation of his missionary policy is to assure the Christians in Rome that he is also not planning to remain in that city and build on other peoples foundations (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/12'>2CO 10:12-18</a>). However, he does solicit their help in sending him on his way to Spain, which was considered the limit of the western world. Thus Pauls addressees realize that evangelization may be understood in the broader sense of mission or, as in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/15'>ROM 1:15</a>, of instruction within the Christian community that derives from the gospel."
NABRE,45,15,21,"[9] The citation from <a href='/NABRE/23/52/15'>ISA 52:15</a> concerns the Servant of the Lord. According to Isaiah, the Servant is first of all Israel, which was to bring the knowledge of Yahweh to the nations. In <a href='/NABRE/45/9/1'>ROM 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/11/1'>11</a> Paul showed how Israel failed in this mission. Therefore, he himself undertakes almost singlehandedly Israels responsibility as the Servant and moves as quickly as possible with the gospel through the Roman empire."
NABRE,45,15,25,"[10] 15:25-27 Paul may have viewed the contribution he was gathering from Gentile Christians for the poor in Jerusalem (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>9</a>) as a fulfillment of the vision of <a href='/NABRE/23/60/5'>ISA 60:5-6</a>. In confidence that the messianic fulfillment was taking place, Paul stresses in <a href='/NABRE/45/14/1'>ROM 14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/16/1'>16</a> the importance of harmonious relationships between Jews and Gentiles."
NABRE,45,15,26,[11] Achaia: the Roman province of southern Greece.
NABRE,45,16,1,"[1] 16:1-23 Some authorities regard these verses as a later addition to the letter, but in general the evidence favors the view that they were included in the original. Paul endeavors through the long list of greetings (<a href='/NABRE/45/16/3'>ROM 16:3-16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/45/16/21'>21-23</a>) to establish strong personal contact with congregations that he has not personally encountered before. The combination of Jewish and Gentile names dramatically attests the unity in the gospel that transcends previous barriers of nationality, religious ceremony, or racial status."

NABRE,46,1,6,"[3] The testimony: this defines the purpose of Pauls mission (see also <a href='/NABRE/46/15/15'>1CO 15:15</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/46/2/1'>1CO 2:1</a>). The forms of his testimony include oral preaching and instruction, his letters, and the life he leads as an apostle."
NABRE,46,1,10,"[4] 1:10-4:21 The first problem Paul addresses is that of divisions within the community. Although we are unable to reconstruct the situation in Corinth completely, Paul clearly traces the divisions back to a false self-image on the part of the Corinthians, coupled with a false understanding of the apostles who preached to them (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/4/6'>1CO 4:6, 9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/1'>9:1-5</a>) and of the Christian message itself. In these chapters he attempts to deal with those underlying factors and to bring the Corinthians back to a more correct perspective."
NABRE,46,1,12,"[5] I belong to: the activities of Paul and Apollos in Corinth are described in <a href='/NABRE/44/18/1'>ACT 18</a>. Cephas(i.e., ""the Rock,"" a name by which Paul designates Peter also in <a href='/NABRE/46/3/22'>1CO 3:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/5'>9:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/15/5'>15:5</a> and in <a href='/NABRE/48/1/18'>GAL 1:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/2/9'>2:9, 11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/2/14'>14</a>) may well have passed through Corinth; he could have baptized some members of the community either there or elsewhere. The reference to Christmay be intended ironically here."
NABRE,46,1,13,[6] 1:13-17 The reference to baptism and the contrast with preaching the gospel in v 17a suggest that some Corinthians were paying special allegiance to the individuals who initiated them into the community.
NABRE,46,1,17,"[7] 1:17b-18 The basic theme of <a href='/NABRE/46/1/1'>1CO 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/4/1'>4</a> is announced. Adherence to individual leaders has something to do with differences in rhetorical ability and also with certain presuppositions regarding wisdom, eloquence, and effectiveness (power), which Paul judges to be in conflict with the gospel and the cross."
NABRE,46,1,17,"[8] 1:17b Not with the wisdom of human eloquence: both of the nouns employed here involve several levels of meaning, on which Paul deliberately plays as his thought unfolds. Wisdom(sophia) may be philosophical and speculative, but in biblical usage the term primarily denotes practical knowledge such as is demonstrated in the choice and effective application of means to achieve an end. The same term can designate the arts of building (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/3/10'>1CO 3:10</a>) or of persuasive speaking (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/2/4'>1CO 2:4</a>) or effectiveness in achieving salvation. Eloquence(logos): this translation emphasizes one possible meaning of the term logos(cf. the references to rhetorical style and persuasiveness in <a href='/NABRE/46/2/1'>1CO 2:1, 4</a>). But the term itself may denote an internal reasoning process, plan, or intention, as well as an external word, speech, or message. So by his expression ouk en sophia logouin the context of gospel preaching, Paul may intend to exclude both human ways of reasoning or thinking about things and human rhetorical technique. Human: this adjective does not stand in the Greek text but is supplied from the context. Paul will begin immediately to distinguish between sophiaand logosfrom their divine counterparts and play them off against each other."
NABRE,46,1,21,"[9] 1:21-25 True wisdom and power are to be found paradoxically where one would least expect them, in the place of their apparent negation. To human eyes the crucified Christ symbolizes impotence and absurdity."
NABRE,46,1,25,"[10] 1:26-2:5 The pattern of Gods wisdom and power is exemplified in their own experience, if they interpret it rightly (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/26'>1CO 1:26-31</a>), and can also be read in their experience of Paul as he first appeared among them preaching the gospel (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/1'>1CO 2:1-5</a>)."
NABRE,46,1,29,"[11] 1:29-31 ""Boasting (about oneself)"" is a Pauline expression for the radical sin, the claim to autonomy on the part of a creature, the illusion that we live and are saved by our own resources. ""Boasting in the Lord"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/31'>1CO 1:31</a>), on the other hand, is the acknowledgment that we live only from God and for God."
NABRE,46,2,1,"[1] The mystery of God: Gods secret, known only to himself, is his plan for the salvation of his people; it is clear from <a href='/NABRE/46/1/18'>1CO 1:18-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/2/2'>2:2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/2/8'>8-10</a> that this secret involves Jesus and the cross. In place of mystery, other good manuscripts read ""testimony"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/1/6'>1CO 1:6</a>)."
NABRE,46,2,3,"[2] The weaknessof the crucified Jesus is reflected in Pauls own bearing (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a>). Fear and much trembling: reverential fear based on a sense of Gods transcendence permeates Pauls existence and preaching. Compare his advice to the Philippians to work out their salvation with ""fear and trembling"" (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/12'>PHL 2:12</a>), because God is at work in them just as his exalting power was paradoxically at work in the emptying, humiliation, and obedience of Jesus to death on the cross (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-11</a>)."
NABRE,46,2,4,"[3] Among many manuscript readings here the best is either ""not with the persuasion of wisdom"" or ""not with persuasive words of wisdom,"" which differ only by a nuance. Whichever reading is accepted, the inefficacy of human wisdom for salvation is contrasted with the power of the cross."
NABRE,46,2,5,"[4] 2:6-3:4 Paul now asserts paradoxically what he has previously been denying. To the Greeks who ""are looking for wisdom"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/22'>1CO 1:22</a>), he does indeed bring a wisdom, but of a higher order and an entirely different quality, the only wisdom really worthy of the name. The Corinthians would be able to grasp Pauls preaching as wisdom and enter into a wisdom-conversation with him if they were more open to the Spirit and receptive to the new insight and language that the Spirit teaches."
NABRE,46,2,7,"[5] 2:7-10a Gods wisdom: his plan for our salvation. This was his own eternal secret that no one else could fathom, but in this new age of salvation he has graciously revealed it to us. For the pattern of Gods secret, hidden to others and now revealed to the Church, cf. also <a href='/NABRE/45/11/25'>ROM 11:25-36</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/16/25'>16:25-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/1/3'>EPH 1:3-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/3/3'>3:3-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/1/25'>COL 1:25-28</a>."
NABRE,46,2,8,"[6] The rulers of this age: this suggests not only the political leaders of the Jews and Romans under whom Jesus was crucified (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/4/25'>ACT 4:25-28</a>) but also the cosmic powers behind them (cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/1/20'>EPH 1:20-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/3/10'>3:10</a>). They would not have crucified the Lord of glory: they became the unwitting executors of Gods plan, which will paradoxically bring about their own conquest and submission (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/24'>1CO 15:24-28</a>)."
NABRE,46,2,13,"[7] In spiritual terms: the Spirit teaches spiritual people a new mode of perception (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/12'>1CO 2:12</a>) and an appropriate language by which they can share their self-understanding, their knowledge about what God has done in them. The final phrase in <a href='/NABRE/46/2/13'>1CO 2:13</a> can also be translated ""describing spiritual realities to spiritual people,"" in which case it prepares for <a href='/NABRE/46/2/14'>1CO 2:14-16</a>."
NABRE,46,2,14,[8] The natural person: see note on <a href='/NABRE/46/3/1'>1CO 3:1</a>.
NABRE,46,2,15,"[9] The spiritual person…is not subject to judgment: since spiritual persons have been given knowledge of what pertains to God (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/11'>1CO 2:11-12</a>), they share in Gods own capacity to judge. One to whom the mind of the Lord (and of Christ) is revealed (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/16'>1CO 2:16</a>) can be said to share in some sense in Gods exemption from counseling and criticism."
NABRE,46,3,1,"[1] 3:1-4 The Corinthians desire a sort of wisdom dialogue or colloquy with Paul; they are looking for solid, adult food, and he appears to disappoint their expectations. Paul counters: if such a dialogue has not yet taken place, the reason is that they are still at an immature stage of development (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/2/6'>1CO 2:6</a>)."
NABRE,46,3,1,"[2] Spiritual people…fleshly people: Paul employs two clusters of concepts and terms to distinguish what later theology will call the ""natural"" and the ""supernatural."" (1) The natural person (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/14'>1CO 2:14</a>) is one whose existence, perceptions, and behavior are determined by purely natural principles, the psychē(<a href='/NABRE/46/2/14'>1CO 2:14</a>) and the sarx(flesh, a biblical term that connotes creatureliness, <a href='/NABRE/46/3/1'>1CO 3:1, 3</a>). Such persons are only infants (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/1'>1CO 3:1</a>); they remain on a purely human level (anthrōpoi, <a href='/NABRE/46/3/4'>1CO 3:4</a>). (2) On the other hand, they are called to be animated by a higher principle, the pneuma, Gods spirit. They are to become spiritual (pneumatikoi, <a href='/NABRE/46/3/1'>1CO 3:1</a>) and mature (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/6'>1CO 2:6</a>) in their perceptions and behavior (cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/5/16'>GAL 5:16-26</a>). The culmination of existence in the Spirit is described in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/44'>1CO 15:44-49</a>."
NABRE,46,3,3,"[3] 3:3-4 Jealousy, rivalry, and divisions in the community are symptoms of their arrested development; they reveal the immaturity both of their self-understanding (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/4'>1CO 3:4</a>) and of the judgments about their apostles (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/21'>1CO 3:21</a>)."
NABRE,46,3,4,"[4] 3:5-4:5 The Corinthians tend to evaluate their leaders by the criteria of human wisdom and to exaggerate their importance. Paul views the role of the apostles in the light of his theology of spiritual gifts (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/12/1'>1CO 12</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/14/1'>14</a>, where the charism of the apostle heads the lists). The essential aspects of all spiritual gifts (<a href='/NABRE/46/12/4'>1CO 12:4-6</a> presents them as gifts of grace, as services, and as modes of activity) are exemplified by the apostolate, which is a gift of grace (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/10'>1CO 3:10</a>) through which God works (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/9'>1CO 3:9</a>) and a form of service (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/5'>1CO 3:5</a>) for the common good (elsewhere expressed by the verb ""build up,"" suggested here by the image of the building, <a href='/NABRE/46/3/9'>1CO 3:9</a>). The apostles serve the church, but their accountability is to God and to Christ (<a href='/NABRE/46/4/1'>1CO 4:1-5</a>)."
NABRE,46,3,5,"[5] Ministers: for other expressions of Pauls understanding of himself as minister or steward to the church, cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/4/1'>1CO 4:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/17'>9:17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/9/19'>19-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/1'>4:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/5/18'>5:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/6/3'>6:3-4</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/47/11/23'>2CO 11:23</a> (the climax of Pauls defense)."
NABRE,46,3,10,"[6] 3:10-11 There are diverse functions in the service of the community, but each individuals task is serious, and each will stand accountable for the quality of his contribution."
NABRE,46,3,13,"[7] The Day: the great day of Yahweh, the day of judgment, which can be a time of either gloom or joy. Fireboth destroys and purifies."
NABRE,46,3,15,"[8] Will be saved: although Paul can envision very harsh divine punishment (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/3/17'>1CO 3:17</a>), he appears optimistic about the success of divine corrective means both here and elsewhere (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/5/5'>1CO 5:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/11/32'>11:32</a> [discipline]). The text of <a href='/NABRE/46/3/15'>1CO 3:15</a> has sometimes been used to support the notion of purgatory, though it does not envisage this."
NABRE,46,3,17,"[9] Holy: i.e., ""belonging to God."" The cultic sanctity of the community is a fundamental theological reality to which Paul frequently alludes (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/1/2'>1CO 1:2, 30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/6/11'>6:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/7/14'>7:14</a>)."
NABRE,46,3,21,"[10] 3:21-23 These verses pick up the line of thought of <a href='/NABRE/46/1/10'>1CO 1:10-13</a>. If the Corinthians were genuinely wise (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/18'>1CO 3:18-20</a>), their perceptions would be reversed, and they would see everything in the world and all those with whom they exist in the church in their true relations with one another. Paul assigns all the persons involved in the theological universe a position on a scale: God, Christ, church members, church leaders. Read from top to bottom, the scale expresses ownership; read from bottom to top, the obligation to serve. This picture should be complemented by similar statements such as those in <a href='/NABRE/46/8/6'>1CO 8:6</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/15/20'>1CO 15:20-28</a>."
NABRE,46,4,5,"[1] 4:6-21 This is an emotionally charged peroration to the discussion about divisions. It contains several exhortations and statements of Pauls purpose in writing (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/4/6'>1CO 4:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/4/14'>14-17</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/4/21'>21</a>) that counterbalance the initial exhortation at <a href='/NABRE/46/1/10'>1CO 1:10</a>."
NABRE,46,4,6,"[2] That you may learn from us not to go beyond what is written: the words ""to go"" are not in the Greek, but have here been added as the minimum necessary to elicit sense from this difficult passage. It probably means that the Corinthians should avoid the false wisdom of vain speculation, contenting themselves with Pauls proclamation of the cross, which is the fulfillment of Gods promises in the Old Testament (what is written). Inflated with pride: literally, ""puffed up,"" i.e., arrogant, filled with a sense of self-importance. The term is particularly Pauline, found in the New Testament only in <a href='/NABRE/46/4/6'>1CO 4:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/4/18'>18-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/5/2'>5:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/8/1'>8:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/13/4'>13:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/2/18'>COL 2:18</a> (cf. the related noun at <a href='/NABRE/47/12/20'>2CO 12:20</a>). It sometimes occurs in conjunction with the theme of ""boasting,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/46/4/6'>1CO 4:6-7</a> here."
NABRE,46,4,8,"[3] Satisfied…rich…kings: these three statements could also be punctuated as questions continuing the series begun in v 7. In any case these expressions reflect a tendency at Corinth toward an overrealized eschatology, a form of self-deception that draws Pauls irony. The underlying attitude has implications for the Corinthians thinking about other issues, notably morality and the resurrection, that Paul will address later in the letter."
NABRE,46,4,9,"[4] 4:9-13 A rhetorically effective catalogue of the circumstances of apostolic existence, in the course of which Paul ironically contrasts his own sufferings with the Corinthians illusion that they have passed beyond the folly of the passion and have already reached the condition of glory. His language echoes that of the beatitudes and woes, which assert a future reversal of present conditions. Their present sufferings (""to this very hour,"" 11) place the apostles in the class of those to whom the beatitudes promise future relief (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-23</a>); whereas the Corinthians image of themselves as ""already"" filled, rich, ruling (<a href='/NABRE/46/4/8'>1CO 4:8</a>), as wise, strong, and honored (<a href='/NABRE/46/4/10'>1CO 4:10</a>) places them paradoxically in the position of those whom the woes threaten with future undoing (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/24'>LUK 6:24-26</a>). They have lost sight of the fact that the reversal is predicted for the future."
NABRE,46,4,14,"[5] 4:14-17 My beloved children: the close of the argument is dominated by the tender metaphor of the father who not only gives his children life but also educates them. Once he has begotten them through his preaching, Paul continues to present the gospel to them existentially, by his life as well as by his word, and they are to learn, as children do, by imitating their parents (<a href='/NABRE/46/4/16'>1CO 4:16</a>). The reference to the rodin <a href='/NABRE/46/4/21'>1CO 4:21</a> belongs to the same image-complex. So does the image of the waysin <a href='/NABRE/46/4/17'>1CO 4:17</a>: the ways that Paul teaches everywhere, ""his ways in Christ Jesus,"" mean a behavior pattern quite different from the human ways along which the Corinthians are walking (<a href='/NABRE/46/3/3'>1CO 3:3</a>)."
NABRE,46,4,18,"[6] 4:18-21 <a href='/NABRE/46/4/20'>1CO 4:20</a> picks up the contrast between a certain kind of talk (logos) and true power (dynamis) from <a href='/NABRE/46/1/17'>1CO 1:17-18</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/2/4'>1CO 2:4-5</a>. The kingdom, which many of them imagine to be fully present in their lives (<a href='/NABRE/46/4/8'>1CO 4:8</a>), will be rather unexpectedly disclosed in the strength of Pauls encounter with them, if they make a powerful intervention on his part necessary. Compare the similar ending to an argument in <a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>2CO 13:1-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/13/10'>10</a>."
NABRE,46,5,1,"[1] 5:1-6:20 Paul now takes up a number of other matters that require regulation. These have come to his attention by hearsay (<a href='/NABRE/46/5/1'>1CO 5:1</a>), probably in reports brought by ""Chloes people"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/11'>1CO 1:11</a>)."
NABRE,46,5,1,[2] 5:1-13 Paul first deals with the incestuous union of a man with his stepmother (<a href='/NABRE/46/5/1'>1CO 5:1-8</a>) and then attempts to clarify general admonitions he has given about associating with fellow Christians guilty of immorality (<a href='/NABRE/46/5/9'>1CO 5:9-13</a>). Each of these three brief paragraphs expresses the same idea: the need of separation between the holy and the unholy.
NABRE,46,5,2,"[3] Inflated with pride: this remark and the reference to boastingin <a href='/NABRE/46/5/6'>1CO 5:6</a> suggest that they are proud of themselves despite the infection in their midst, tolerating and possibly even approving the situation. The attitude expressed in <a href='/NABRE/46/6/2'>1CO 6:2, 13</a> may be influencing their thinking in this case."
NABRE,46,5,5,"[4] Deliver this man to Satan: once the sinner is expelled from the church, the sphere of Jesus lordship and victory over sin, he will be in the region outside over which Satan is still master. For the destruction of his flesh: the purpose of the penalty is medicinal: through affliction, sins grip over him may be destroyed and the path to repentance and reunion laid open. With Pauls instructions for an excommunication ceremony here, contrast his recommendations for the reconciliation of a sinner in <a href='/NABRE/47/2/5'>2CO 2:5-11</a>."
NABRE,46,5,6,"[5] A little yeast: yeast, which induces fermentation, is a natural symbol for a source of corruption that becomes all-pervasive. The expression is proverbial."
NABRE,46,5,7,"[6] 5:7-8 In the Jewish calendar, Passover was followed immediately by the festival of Unleavened Bread. In preparation for this feast all traces of old bread were removed from the house, and during the festival only unleavened bread was eaten. The sequence of these two feasts provides Paul with an image of Christian existence: Christs death (the true Passover celebration) is followed by the life of the Christian community, marked by newness, purity, and integrity (a perpetual feast of unleavened bread). Paul may have been writing around Passover time (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/16/5'>1CO 16:5</a>); this is a little Easter homily, the earliest in Christian literature."
NABRE,46,5,9,[7] 5:9-13 Paul here corrects a misunderstanding of his earlier directives against associating with immoral fellow Christians. He concedes the impossibility of avoiding contact with sinners in society at large but urges the Corinthians to maintain the inner purity of their own community.
NABRE,46,6,1,"[1] 6:1-11 Christians at Corinth are suing one another before pagan judges in Roman courts. A barrage of rhetorical questions (<a href='/NABRE/46/6/1'>1CO 6:1-9</a>) betrays Pauls indignation over this practice, which he sees as an infringement upon the holiness of the Christian community."
NABRE,46,6,2,"[2] 6:2-3 The principle to which Paul appeals is an eschatological prerogative promised to Christians: they are to share with Christ the judgment of the world (cf. <a href='/NABRE/27/7/22'>DAN 7:22, 27</a>). Hence they ought to be able to settle minor disputes within the community."
NABRE,46,6,9,[3] 6:9-10 A catalogue of typical vices that exclude from the kingdom of God and that should be excluded from Gods church. Such lists (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/5/10'>1CO 5:10</a>) reflect the common moral sensibility of the New Testament period.
NABRE,46,6,9,"[4] The Greek word translated as boy prostitutesmay refer to catamites, i.e., boys or young men who were kept for purposes of prostitution, a practice not uncommon in the Greco-Roman world. In Greek mythology this was the function of Ganymede, the ""cupbearer of the gods,"" whose Latin name was Catamitus. The term translated sodomitesrefers to adult males who indulged in homosexual practices with such boys. See similar condemnations of such practices in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/26'>ROM 1:26-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/1/10'>1TM 1:10</a>."
NABRE,46,6,11,[5] 6:12-20 Paul now turns to the opinion of some Corinthians that sexuality is a morally indifferent area (<a href='/NABRE/46/6/12'>1CO 6:12-13</a>). This leads him to explain the mutual relation between the Lord Jesus and our bodies (<a href='/NABRE/46/6/13'>1CO 6:13</a>b) in a densely packed paragraph that contains elements of a profound theology of sexuality (<a href='/NABRE/46/6/15'>1CO 6:15-20</a>).
NABRE,46,6,12,"[6] 6:12-13 Everything is lawful for me: the Corinthians may have derived this slogan from Pauls preaching about Christian freedom, but they mean something different by it: they consider sexual satisfaction a matter as indifferent as food, and they attribute no lasting significance to bodily functions (<a href='/NABRE/46/6/13'>1CO 6:13</a>a). Paul begins to deal with the slogan by two qualifications, which suggest principles for judging sexual activity. Not everything is beneficial: cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/10/23'>1CO 10:23</a>, and the whole argument of <a href='/NABRE/46/8/1'>1CO 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>10</a> on the finality of freedom and moral activity. Not let myself be dominated: certain apparently free actions may involve in fact a secret servitude in conflict with the lordship of Jesus."
NABRE,46,6,15,"[7] 6:15b-16 A prostitute: the reference may be specifically to religious prostitution, an accepted part of pagan culture at Corinth and elsewhere; but the prostitute also serves as a symbol for any sexual relationship that conflicts with Christs claim over us individually. The two…will become one flesh: the text of <a href='/NABRE/1/2/24'>GEN 2:24</a> is applied positively to human marriage in Matthew and Mark, and in <a href='/NABRE/49/5/29'>EPH 5:29-32</a>: love of husband and wife reflect the love of Christ for his church. The application of the text to union with a prostitute is jarring, for such a union is a parody, an antitype of marriage, which does conflict with Christs claim over us. This explains the horror expressed in <a href='/NABRE/46/6/15'>1CO 6:15</a>b."
NABRE,46,6,18,"[8] Against his own body: expresses the intimacy and depth of sexual disorder, which violates the very orientation of our bodies."
NABRE,46,6,19,"[9] 6:19-20 Pauls vision becomes trinitarian. A temple: sacred by reason of Gods gift, his indwelling Spirit. Not your own: but ""for the Lord,"" who acquires ownership by the act of redemption. Glorify God in your body: the argument concludes with a positive imperative to supplement the negative ""avoid immorality"" of <a href='/NABRE/46/6/18'>1CO 6:18</a>. Far from being a terrain that is morally indifferent, the area of sexuality is one in which our relationship with God (and his Christ and his Spirit) is very intimately expressed: he is either highly glorified or deeply offended."
NABRE,46,7,1,"[1] 7:1-40 Paul now begins to answer questions addressed to him by the Corinthians (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/1'>1CO 7:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/11/1'>11:1</a>). The first of these concerns marriage. This chapter contains advice both to the married (1-16) and to the unmarried (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/25'>1CO 7:25-38</a>) or widowed (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/39'>1CO 7:39-40</a>); these two parts are separated by <a href='/NABRE/46/7/17'>1CO 7:17-24</a>, which enunciate a principle applicable to both."
NABRE,46,7,1,"[2] 7:1-16 It seems that some Christians in Corinth were advocating asceticism in sexual matters. The pattern it is a good thing…, butoccurs twice (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/1'>1CO 7:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/7/8'>8-9</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/7/26'>1CO 7:26</a>), suggesting that in this matter as in others the Corinthians have seized upon a genuine value but are exaggerating or distorting it in some way. Once again Paul calls them to a more correct perspective and a better sense of their own limitations. The phrase it is a good thing(<a href='/NABRE/46/7/1'>1CO 7:1</a>) may have been the slogan of the ascetic party at Corinth."
NABRE,46,7,1,"[3] 7:1-7 References to Pauls own behavior (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/7'>1CO 7:7-8</a>) suggest that his celibate way of life and his preaching to the unmarried (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/7/25'>1CO 7:25-35</a>) have given some the impression that asceticism within marriage, i.e., suspension of normal sexual relations, would be a laudable ideal. Paul points to their experience of widespread immorality to caution them against overestimating their own strength (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/2'>1CO 7:2</a>); as individuals they may not have the particular gift that makes such asceticism feasible (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/7'>1CO 7:7</a>) and hence are to abide by the principle to be explained in <a href='/NABRE/46/7/17'>1CO 7:17-24</a>."
NABRE,46,7,6,[4] By way of concession: this refers most likely to the concession mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/46/7/5'>1CO 7:5</a>a: temporary interruption of relations for a legitimate purpose.
NABRE,46,7,7,[5] A particular gift from God: use of the term charismasuggests that marriage and celibacy may be viewed in the light of Pauls theology of spiritual gifts (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/12'>1CO 7:12-14</a>).
NABRE,46,7,8,"[6] Paul was obviously unmarried when he wrote this verse. Some interpreters believe that he had previously been married and widowed; there is no clear evidence either for or against this view, which was expressed already at the end of the second century by Clement of Alexandria."
NABRE,46,7,10,"[7] 7:10-11 (Not I, but the Lord): Paul reminds the married of Jesus principle of nonseparation (<a href='/NABRE/41/10/9'>MAK 10:9</a>). This is one of his rare specific references to the teaching of Jesus."
NABRE,46,7,12,"[8] 7:12-14 To the rest: marriages in which only one partner is a baptized Christian. Jesus prohibition against divorce is not addressed to them, but Paul extends the principle of nonseparation to such unions, provided they are marked by peacefulness and shared sanctification."
NABRE,46,7,15,"[9] 7:15-16 If the unbeliever separates: the basis of the ""Pauline privilege"" in Catholic marriage legislation."
NABRE,46,7,16,"[10] 7:17-24 On the ground that distinct human conditions are less significant than the whole new existence opened up by Gods call, Paul urges them to be less concerned with changing their states of life than with answering Gods call where it finds them. The principle applies both to the married state (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/1'>1CO 7:1-16</a>) and to the unmarried (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/25'>1CO 7:25-38</a>)."
NABRE,46,7,25,"[11] 7:25-28 Paul is careful to explain that the principle of <a href='/NABRE/46/7/17'>1CO 7:17</a> does not bind under sin but that present earthly conditions make it advantageous for the unmarried to remain as they are (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/28'>1CO 7:28</a>). These remarks must be complemented by the statement about ""particular gifts"" from <a href='/NABRE/46/7/7'>1CO 7:7</a>."
NABRE,46,7,29,[12] 7:29-31 The world…is passing away: Paul advises Christians to go about the ordinary activities of life in a manner different from those who are totally immersed in them and unaware of their transitoriness.
NABRE,46,7,36,"[13] 7:36-38 The passage is difficult to interpret, because it is unclear whether Paul is thinking of a father and his unmarried daughter (or slave), or of a couple engaged in a betrothal or spiritual marriage. The general principles already enunciated apply: there is no question of sin, even if they should marry, but staying as they are is ""better"" (for the reasons mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/46/7/28'>1CO 7:28-35</a>). Once again the charismaof <a href='/NABRE/46/7/7'>1CO 7:7</a> which applies also to the unmarried (<a href='/NABRE/46/7/8'>1CO 7:8-9</a>), is to be presupposed."
NABRE,46,7,36,"[14] A critical moment has come: either because the woman will soon be beyond marriageable age, or because their passions are becoming uncontrollable (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/7/9'>1CO 7:9</a>)."
NABRE,46,7,39,"[15] 7:39-40 Application of the principles to the case of widows. If they do choose to remarry, they ought to prefer Christian husbands."
NABRE,46,7,40,"[16] 8:1-11:1 The Corinthians second question concerns meat that has been sacrificed to idols; in this area they were exhibiting a disordered sense of liberation that Paul here tries to rectify. These chapters contain a sustained and unified argument that illustrates Pauls method of theological reflection on a moral dilemma. Although the problem with which he is dealing is dated, the guidelines for moral decisions that he offers are of lasting validity. Essentially Paul urges them to take a communitarian rather than an individualistic view of their Christian freedom. Many decisions that they consider pertinent only to their private relationship with God have, in fact, social consequences. Nor can moral decisions be determined by merely theoretical considerations; they must be based on concrete circumstances, specifically on the value and needs of other individuals and on mutual responsibility within the community. Paul here introduces the theme of ""building up"" (oikodomē), i.e., of contributing by individual action to the welfare and growth of the community. This theme will be further developed in <a href='/NABRE/46/14/1'>1CO 14</a>; see note on <a href='/NABRE/46/14/3'>1CO 14:3</a>b-5. Several years later Paul would again deal with the problem of meat sacrificed to idols in <a href='/NABRE/45/14/1'>ROM 14:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/15/6'>15:6</a>."
NABRE,46,8,1,"[1] 8:1a Meat sacrificed to idols: much of the food consumed in the city could have passed through pagan religious ceremonies before finding its way into markets and homes. ""All of us have knowledge"": a slogan, similar to <a href='/NABRE/46/6/12'>1CO 6:12</a>, which reveals the self-image of the Corinthians. <a href='/NABRE/46/8/4'>1CO 8:4</a> will specify the content of this knowledge."
NABRE,46,8,6,"[2] This verse rephrases the monotheistic confession of v 4 in such a way as to contrast it with polytheism (<a href='/NABRE/46/8/5'>1CO 8:5</a>) and to express our relationship with the one God in concrete, i.e., in personal and Christian terms. And for whom we exist: since the Greek contains no verb here and the action intended must be inferred from the preposition eis, another translation is equally possible: ""toward whom we return."" Through whom all things: the earliest reference in the New Testament to Jesus role in creation."
NABRE,46,8,8,"[3] 8:8-9 Although the food in itself is morally neutral, extrinsic circumstances may make the eating of it harmful. A stumbling block: the image is that of tripping or causing someone to fall (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/8/13'>1CO 8:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/12'>9:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/10/12'>10:12, 32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/6/3'>2CO 6:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/14/13'>ROM 14:13</a>, <a href='/NABRE/45/14/20'>20-1</a>). This is a basic moral imperative for Paul, a counterpart to the positive imperative to ""build one another up""; compare the expression ""giving offense"" as opposed to ""pleasing"" in <a href='/NABRE/46/10/32'>1CO 10:32-33</a>."
NABRE,46,8,13,[4] His own course is clear: he will avoid any action that might harm another Christian. This statement prepares for the paradigmatic development in <a href='/NABRE/46/9/1'>1CO 9</a>.
NABRE,46,9,3,"[1] My defense against those who would pass judgment on me: the reference to a defense (apologia) is surprising, and suggests that Paul is incorporating some material here that he has previously used in another context. The defense will touch on two points: the fact of Pauls rights as an apostle (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/4'>1CO 9:4-12</a>a and <a href='/NABRE/46/9/13'>1CO 9:13-14</a>) and his nonuse of those rights (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/12'>1CO 9:12</a>b and <a href='/NABRE/46/9/15'>1CO 9:15-18</a>)."
NABRE,46,9,4,"[2] 9:4-12a Apparently some believe that Paul is not equal to the other apostles and therefore does not enjoy equal privileges. His defense on this point (here and in <a href='/NABRE/46/9/13'>1CO 9:13-14</a>) reinforces the assertion of his apostolic character in <a href='/NABRE/46/9/2'>1CO 9:2</a>. It consists of a series of analogies from natural equity (7) and religious custom (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/13'>1CO 9:13</a>) designed to establish his equal right to support from the churches (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/4'>1CO 9:4-6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/9/11'>11-12</a>a); these analogies are confirmed by the authority of the law (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/8'>1CO 9:8-10</a>) and of Jesus himself (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/14'>1CO 9:14</a>)."
NABRE,46,9,12,"[3] It appears, too, that suspicion or misunderstanding has been created by Pauls practice of not living from his preaching. The first reason he asserts in defense of this practice is an entirely apostolic one; it anticipates the developments to follow in <a href='/NABRE/46/9/19'>1CO 9:19-22</a>. He will give a second reason in <a href='/NABRE/46/9/15'>1CO 9:15-18</a>."
NABRE,46,9,13,"[4] 9:13-14 The position of these verses produces an interlocking of the two points of Pauls defense. These arguments by analogy (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/13'>1CO 9:13</a>) and from authority (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/14'>1CO 9:14</a>) belong with those of <a href='/NABRE/46/9/7'>1CO 9:7-10</a> and ground the first point. But Paul defers them until he has had a chance to mention ""the gospel of Christ"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/12'>1CO 9:12</a>b), after which it is more appropriate to mention Jesus injunction to his preachers and to argue by analogy from the sacred temple service to his own liturgical service, the preaching of the gospel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/9'>ROM 1:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/15/16'>15:16</a>)."
NABRE,46,9,15,"[5] 9:15-18 Paul now assigns a more personal motive to his nonuse of his right to support. His preaching is not a service spontaneously undertaken on his part but a stewardship imposed by a sort of divine compulsion. Yet to merit any reward he must bring some spontaneous quality to his service, and this he does by freely renouncing his right to support. The material here is quite similar to that contained in Pauls ""defense"" at <a href='/NABRE/47/11/5'>2CO 11:5-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>12:11-18</a>."
NABRE,46,9,19,[6] 9:19-23 In a rhetorically balanced series of statements Paul expands and generalizes the picture of his behavior and explores the paradox of apostolic freedom. It is not essentially freedom from restraint but freedom for service—a possibility of constructive activity.
NABRE,46,9,24,"[7] 9:24-27 A series of miniparables from sports, appealing to readers familiar with Greek gymnasia and the nearby Isthmian games."
NABRE,46,9,27,"[8] For fear that…I myself should be disqualified: a final paradoxical turn to the argument: what appears at first a free, spontaneous renunciation of rights (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/12'>1CO 9:12-18</a>) seems subsequently to be required for fulfillment of Pauls stewardship (to preach effectively he must reach his hearers wherever they are, <a href='/NABRE/46/9/19'>1CO 9:19-22</a>), and finally is seen to be necessary for his own salvation (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/23'>1CO 9:23-27</a>). Mention of the possibility of disqualification provides a transition to <a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>1CO 10</a>."
NABRE,46,10,1,"[1] 10:1-5 Paul embarks unexpectedly upon a panoramic survey of the events of the Exodus period. The privileges of Israel in the wilderness are described in terms that apply strictly only to the realities of the new covenant (""baptism,"" ""spiritual food and drink""); interpreted in this way they point forward to the Christian experience (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>1CO 10:1-4</a>). But those privileges did not guarantee Gods permanent pleasure (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/5'>1CO 10:5</a>)."
NABRE,46,10,4,"[2] A spiritual rock that followed them: the Torah speaks only about a rock from which water issued, but rabbinic legend amplified this into a spring that followed the Israelites throughout their migration. Paul uses this legend as a literary type: he makes the rock itself accompany the Israelites, and he gives it a spiritual sense. The rock was the Christ: in the Old Testament, Yahweh is the Rock of his people (cf. <a href='/NABRE/5/32/1'>DEU 32</a>, Moses song to Yahweh the Rock). Paul now applies this image to the Christ, the source of the living water, the true Rock that accompanied Israel, guiding their experiences in the desert."
NABRE,46,10,6,"[3] 10:6-13 This section explicitates the typological value of these Old Testament events: the desert experiences of the Israelites are examples, meant as warnings, to deter us from similar sins (idolatry, immorality, etc.) and from a similar fate."
NABRE,46,10,9,"[4] Christ: to avoid Pauls concept of Christ present in the wilderness events, some manuscripts read ""the Lord."""
NABRE,46,10,11,[5] Upon whom the end of the ages has come: it is our period in time toward which past ages have been moving and in which they arrive at their goal.
NABRE,46,10,12,"[6] 10:12-13 Take care not to fall: the point of the whole comparison with Israel is to caution against overconfidence, a sense of complete security (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/12'>1CO 10:12</a>). This warning is immediately balanced by a reassurance, based, however, on God (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/13'>1CO 10:13</a>)."
NABRE,46,10,13,"[7] 10:14-22 The warning against idolatry from <a href='/NABRE/46/10/7'>1CO 10:7</a> is now repeated (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/14'>1CO 10:14</a>) and explained in terms of the effect of sacrifices: all sacrifices, Christian (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/16'>1CO 10:16-17</a>), Jewish (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/18'>1CO 10:18</a>), or pagan (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/20'>1CO 10:20</a>), establish communion. But communion with Christ is exclusive, incompatible with any other such communion (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/21'>1CO 10:21</a>). Compare the line of reasoning at <a href='/NABRE/46/6/15'>1CO 6:15</a>."
NABRE,46,10,20,"[8] To demons: although Jews denied divinity to pagan gods, they often believed that there was some nondivine reality behind the idols, such as the dead, or angels, or demons. The explanation Paul offers in <a href='/NABRE/46/10/20'>1CO 10:20</a> is drawn from <a href='/NABRE/5/32/17'>DEU 32:17</a>: the power behind the idols, with which the pagans commune, consists of demonic powers hostile to God."
NABRE,46,10,22,[9] 10:23-11:1 By way of peroration Paul returns to the opening situation (<a href='/NABRE/46/8/1'>1CO 8</a>) and draws conclusions based on the intervening considerations (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/1'>1CO 9</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>10</a>).
NABRE,46,10,23,"[10] 10:23-24 He repeats in the context of this new problem the slogans of liberty from <a href='/NABRE/46/6/12'>1CO 6:12</a>, with similar qualifications. Liberty is not merely an individual perfection, nor an end in itself, but is to be used for the common good. The language of <a href='/NABRE/46/10/24'>1CO 10:24</a> recalls the descriptions of Jesus self-emptying in <a href='/NABRE/50/2/1'>PHL 2</a>."
NABRE,46,10,25,"[11] 10:25-30 A summary of specific situations in which the eating of meat sacrificed to idols could present problems of conscience. Three cases are considered. In the first (the marketplace, <a href='/NABRE/46/10/25'>1CO 10:25-26</a>) and the second (at table, <a href='/NABRE/46/10/27'>1CO 10:27</a>), there is no need to be concerned with whether food has passed through a pagan sacrifice or not, for the principle of <a href='/NABRE/46/8/4'>1CO 8:4-6</a> still stands, and the whole creation belongs to the one God. But in the third case (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/28'>1CO 10:28</a>), the situation changes if someone present explicitly raises the question of the sacrificial origin of the food; eating in such circumstances may be subject to various interpretations, some of which could be harmful to individuals. Paul is at pains to insist that the enlightened Christian conscience need not change its judgment about the neutrality, even the goodness, of the food in itself (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/29'>1CO 10:29-30</a>); yet the total situation is altered to the extent that others are potentially endangered, and this calls for a different response, for the sake of others."
NABRE,46,10,32,"[12] 10:32-11:1 In summary, the general rule of mutually responsible use of their Christian freedom is enjoined first negatively (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/32'>1CO 10:32</a>), then positively, as exemplified in Paul (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/33'>1CO 10:33</a>), and finally grounded in Christ, the pattern for Pauls behavior and theirs (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/1'>1CO 11:1</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/15/1'>ROM 15:1-3</a>)."
NABRE,46,11,2,"[1] 11:2-14:40 This section of the letter is devoted to regulation of conduct at the liturgy. The problems Paul handles have to do with the dress of women in the assembly (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/3'>1CO 11:3-16</a>), improprieties in the celebration of community meals (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/17'>1CO 11:17-34</a>), and the use of charisms or spiritual gifts (<a href='/NABRE/46/12/1'>1CO 12:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/14/40'>14:40</a>). The statement in <a href='/NABRE/46/11/2'>1CO 11:2</a> introduces all of these discussions, but applies more appropriately to the second (cf. the mention of praise in <a href='/NABRE/46/11/17'>1CO 11:17</a> and of tradition in <a href='/NABRE/46/11/23'>1CO 11:23</a>)."
NABRE,46,11,3,"[2] 11:3-16 Women have been participating in worship at Corinth without the head-covering normal in Greek society of the period. Pauls stated goal is to bring them back into conformity with contemporary practice and propriety. In his desire to convince, he reaches for arguments from a variety of sources, though he has space to develop them only sketchily and is perhaps aware that they differ greatly in persuasiveness."
NABRE,46,11,3,"[3] A husband the head of his wife: the specific problem suggests to Paul the model of the head as a device for clarifying relations within a hierarchical structure. The model is similar to that developed later in greater detail and nuance in <a href='/NABRE/49/5/21'>EPH 5:21-33</a>. It is a hybrid model, for it grafts onto a strictly theological scale of existence (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/3/21'>1CO 3:21-23</a>) the hierarchy of sociosexual relations prevalent in the ancient world: men, dominant, reflect the active function of Christ in relation to his church; women, submissive, reflect the passive role of the church with respect to its savior. This gives us the functional scale: God, Christ, man, woman."
NABRE,46,11,4,"[4] 11:4-6 From mans direct relation to Christ, Paul infers that his head should not be covered. But woman, related not directly to Christ on the scale but to her husband, requires a covering as a sign of that relationship. Shameful…to have her hair cut off: certain less honored classes in society, such as lesbians and prostitutes, are thought to have worn their hair close-cropped."
NABRE,46,11,7,"[5] 11:7-9 The hierarchy of v 3 is now expressed in other metaphors: the image (eikōn) and the reflected glory (doxa). Paul is alluding basically to the text of <a href='/NABRE/1/1/27'>GEN 1:27</a>, in which mankind as a whole, the male-female couple, is created in Gods image and given the command to multiply and together dominate the lower creation. But <a href='/NABRE/1/1/24'>GEN 1:24</a> is interpreted here in the light of the second creation narrative in <a href='/NABRE/1/2/1'>GEN 2</a>, in which each of the sexes is created separately (first the man and then the woman from man and for him, to be his helpmate, <a href='/NABRE/1/2/20'>GEN 2:20-23</a>), and under the influence of the story of the fall, as a result of which the husband rules over the woman (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/16'>GEN 3:16</a>). This interpretation splits the single image of God into two, at different degrees of closeness."
NABRE,46,11,10,"[6] A sign of authority: ""authority"" (exousia) may possibly be due to mistranslation of an Aramaic word for ""veil""; in any case, the connection with <a href='/NABRE/46/11/9'>1CO 11:9</a> indicates that the covering is a sign of womans subordination. Because of the angels: a surprising additional reason, which the context does not clarify. Presumably the reference is to cosmic powers who might inflict harm on women or whose function is to watch over women or the cult."
NABRE,46,11,11,"[7] 11:11-12 These parenthetical remarks relativize the argument from <a href='/NABRE/1/2/1'>GEN 2</a>-<a href='/NABRE/1/3/1'>3</a>. In the Lord: in the Christian economy the relation between the sexes is characterized by a mutual dependence, which is not further specified. And even in the natural order conditions have changed: the mode of origin described in <a href='/NABRE/1/2/1'>GEN 2</a> has been reversed (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/12'>1CO 11:12</a>a). But the ultimately significant fact is the origin that all things have in common (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/12'>1CO 11:12</a>b)."
NABRE,46,11,13,"[8] 11:13-16 The argument for conformity to common church practice is summed up and pressed home. <a href='/NABRE/46/11/14'>1CO 11:14-15</a> contain a final appeal to the sense of propriety that contemporary Greek society would consider ""natural"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/11/5'>1CO 11:5-6</a>)."
NABRE,46,11,17,"[9] 11:17-34 Paul turns to another abuse connected with the liturgy, and a more serious one, for it involves neglect of basic Christian tradition concerning the meaning of the Lords Supper. Paul recalls that tradition for them and reminds them of its implications."
NABRE,46,11,19,[10] That…those who are approved among you may become known: Paul situates their divisions within the context of the eschatological separation of the authentic from the inauthentic and the final revelation of the difference. The notion of authenticity-testing recurs in the injunction to self-examination in view of present and future judgment (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/28'>1CO 11:28-32</a>).
NABRE,46,11,23,[11] 11:23-25 This is the earliest written account of the institution of the Lords Supper in the New Testament. The narrative emphasizes Jesus action of self-giving (expressed in the words over the bread and the cup) and his double command to repeat his own action.
NABRE,46,11,27,"[12] It follows that the only proper way to celebrate the Eucharist is one that corresponds to Jesus intention, which fits with the meaning of his command to reproduce his action in the proper spirit. If the Corinthians eat and drink unworthily, i.e., without having grasped and internalized the meaning of his death for them, they will have to answer for the body and blood, i.e., will be guilty of a sin against the Lord himself (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/8/12'>1CO 8:12</a>)."
NABRE,46,11,28,"[13] Examine himself: the Greek word is similar to that for ""approved"" in <a href='/NABRE/46/11/19'>1CO 11:19</a>, which means ""having been tested and found true."" The self-testing required for proper eating involves discerning the body(<a href='/NABRE/46/11/29'>1CO 11:29</a>), which, from the context, must mean understanding the sense of Jesus death (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/26'>1CO 11:26</a>), perceiving the imperative to unity that follows from the fact that Jesus gives himself to all and requires us to repeat his sacrifice in the same spirit (<a href='/NABRE/46/11/18'>1CO 11:18-25</a>)."
NABRE,46,11,29,"[14] 11:29-32 Judgment: there is a series of wordplays in these verses that would be awkward to translate literally into English; it includes all the references to judgment (krima, <a href='/NABRE/46/11/29'>1CO 11:29, 34</a>; krinō, <a href='/NABRE/46/11/31'>1CO 11:31, 32</a>) discernment (diakrinō, <a href='/NABRE/46/11/29'>1CO 11:29, 31</a>), and condemnation (katakrinō, <a href='/NABRE/46/11/32'>1CO 11:32</a>). The judgment is concretely described as the illness, infirmity, and death that have visited the community. These are signs that the power of Jesus death is not yet completely recognized and experienced. Yet even the judgment incurred is an expression of Gods concern; it is a medicinal measure meant to rescue us from condemnation with Gods enemies."
NABRE,46,11,34,"[15] 12:1-14:40 Ecstatic and charismatic activity were common in early Christian experience, as they were in other ancient religions. But the Corinthians seem to have developed a disproportionate esteem for certain phenomena, especially tongues, to the detriment of order in the liturgy. Pauls response to this development provides us with the fullest exposition we have of his theology of the charisms."
NABRE,46,12,2,"[1] 12:2-3 There is an experience of the Spirit and an understanding of ecstatic phenomena that are specifically Christian and that differ, despite apparent similarities, from those of the pagans. It is necessary to discern which spirit is leading one; ecstatic phenomena must be judged by their effect (<a href='/NABRE/46/12/2'>1CO 12:2</a>). <a href='/NABRE/46/12/3'>1CO 12:3</a> illustrates this by an example: power to confess Jesus as Lord can come only from the Spirit, and it is inconceivable that the Spirit would move anyone to curse the Lord."
NABRE,46,12,4,"[2] 12:4-6 There are some features common to all charisms, despite their diversity: all are gifts(charismata), grace from outside ourselves; all are forms of service(diakoniai), an expression of their purpose and effect; and all are workings (energēmata), in which God is at work. Paul associates each of these aspects with what later theology will call one of the persons of the Trinity, an early example of ""appropriation."""
NABRE,46,12,11,"[3] 12:12-26 The image of a bodyis introduced to explain Christs relationship with believers (<a href='/NABRE/46/12/12'>1CO 12:12</a>). <a href='/NABRE/46/12/13'>1CO 12:13</a> applies this model to the church: by baptism all, despite diversity of ethnic or social origins, are integrated into one organism. <a href='/NABRE/46/12/14'>1CO 12:14-26</a> then develop the need for diversity of function among the parts of a body without threat to its unity."
NABRE,46,12,26,[4] 12:27-30 Paul now applies the image again to the church as a whole and its members (<a href='/NABRE/46/12/27'>1CO 12:27</a>). The lists in <a href='/NABRE/46/12/28'>1CO 12:28-30</a> spell out the parallelism by specifying the diversity of functions found in the church (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/12/6'>ROM 12:6-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/4/11'>EPH 4:11</a>).
NABRE,46,12,28,"[5] First, apostles: apostleship was not mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/46/12/8'>1CO 12:8-10</a>, nor is it at issue in these chapters, but Paul gives it pride of place in his listing. It is not just one gift among others but a prior and fuller gift that includes the others. They are all demonstrated in Pauls apostolate, but he may have developed his theology of charisms by reflecting first of all on his own grace of apostleship (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/3/5'>1CO 3:5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/4/14'>4:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/1'>9:1-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2CO 2:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/6/13'>6:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>10:1-13</a>:30, esp. <a href='/NABRE/46/11/23'>1CO 11:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/12/12'>12:12</a>)."
NABRE,46,13,1,"[1] 13:1-3 An inventory of gifts, arranged in careful gradation: neither tongues (on the lowest rung), nor prophecy, knowledge, or faith, nor even self-sacrifice has value unless informed by love."
NABRE,46,13,4,"[2] 13:4-7 This paragraph is developed by personification and enumeration, defining love by what it does or does not do. The Greek contains fifteen verbs; it is natural to translate many of them by adjectives in English."
NABRE,46,13,8,"[3] 13:8-13 The final paragraph announces its topic, Love never fails(<a href='/NABRE/46/13/8'>1CO 13:8</a>), then develops the permanence of love in contrast to the charisms (<a href='/NABRE/46/13/9'>1CO 13:9-12</a>), and finally asserts loves superiority even over the other ""theological virtues"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/13/13'>1CO 13:13</a>)."
NABRE,46,13,13,"[4] In speaking of love, Paul is led by spontaneous association to mention faith and hope as well. They are already a well-known triad (cf. <a href='/NABRE/52/1/3'>1TS 1:3</a>), three interrelated (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/13/7'>1CO 13:7</a>) features of Christian life, more fundamental than any particular charism. The greatest…is love: love is operative even within the other members of the triad (<a href='/NABRE/46/13/7'>1CO 13:7</a>), so that it has a certain primacy among them. Or, if the perspective is temporal, love will remain (cf. ""never fails,"" <a href='/NABRE/46/13/8'>1CO 13:8</a>) even when faith has yielded to sight and hope to possession."
NABRE,46,14,1,"[1] 14:1-5 <a href='/NABRE/46/14/1'>1CO 14:1</a>b returns to the thought of <a href='/NABRE/46/12/31'>1CO 12:31</a>a and reveals Pauls primary concern. The series of contrasts in <a href='/NABRE/46/14/2'>1CO 14:2-5</a> discloses the problem at Corinth: a disproportionate interest in tongues, with a corresponding failure to appreciate the worth of prophecy. Paul attempts to clarify the relative values of those gifts by indicating the kind of communication achieved in each and the kind of effect each produces."
NABRE,46,14,2,"[2] 14:2-3a They involve two kinds of communication: tongues, private speech toward God in inarticulate terms that need interpretation to be intelligible to others (see <a href='/NABRE/46/14/27'>1CO 14:27-28</a>); prophecy, communication with others in the community."
NABRE,46,14,3,"[3] 14:3b-5 They produce two kinds of effect. One who speaks in tongues builds himself up; it is a matter of individual experience and personal perfection, which inevitably recalls Pauls previous remarks about being inflated, seeking ones own good, pleasing oneself. But a prophet builds up the church: the theme of ""building up"" or ""edifying"" others, the main theme of the letter, comes to clearest expression in this chapter (<a href='/NABRE/46/14/3'>1CO 14:3, 4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/14/5'>5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/14/12'>12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/14/17'>17</a>). It has been anticipated at <a href='/NABRE/46/8/1'>1CO 8:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/10/23'>1CO 10:23</a>, and by the related concept of ""the beneficial"" in <a href='/NABRE/46/6/12'>1CO 6:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/10/23'>10:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/12/7'>12:7</a>; etc."
NABRE,46,14,6,"[4] 14:6-12 Sound, in order to be useful, must be intelligible. This principle is illustrated by a series of analogies from music (<a href='/NABRE/46/14/7'>1CO 14:7-8</a>) and from ordinary human speech (<a href='/NABRE/46/14/10'>1CO 14:10-11</a>); it is applied to the case at hand in <a href='/NABRE/46/14/9'>1CO 14:9, 12</a>."
NABRE,46,14,12,"[5] 14:13-19 The charism of interpretation lifts tongues to the level of intelligibility, enabling them to produce the same effect as prophecy (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/14/5'>1CO 14:5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/14/26'>26-28</a>)."
NABRE,46,14,14,"[6] 14:14-15 My spirit: Paul emphasizes the exclusively ecstatic, nonrational quality of tongues. The tongues at Pentecost are also described as an ecstatic experience (<a href='/NABRE/44/2/4'>ACT 2:4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/2/12'>12-13</a>), though Luke superimposes further interpretations of his own. My mind: the ecstatic element, dominant in earliest Old Testament prophecy as depicted in <a href='/NABRE/9/10/5'>1SM 10:5-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/9/19/20'>19:20-24</a>, seems entirely absent from Pauls notion of prophecy and completely relegated to tongues. He emphasizes the role of reason when he specifies instruction as a function of prophecy (<a href='/NABRE/46/14/6'>1CO 14:6, 19</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/14/31'>31</a>). But he does not exclude intuition and emotion; cf. references to encouragement and consolation (<a href='/NABRE/46/14/3'>1CO 14:3, 31</a>) and the scene describing the ideal exercise of prophecy (<a href='/NABRE/46/14/24'>1CO 14:24-25</a>)."
NABRE,46,14,20,"[7] 14:20-22 The Corinthians pride themselves on tongues as a sign of Gods favor, a means of direct communication with him (<a href='/NABRE/46/2/28'>2:28</a>). To challenge them to a more mature appraisal, Paul draws from scripture a less flattering explanation of what speaking in tongues may signify. Isaiah threatened the people that if they failed to listen to their prophets, the Lord would speak to them (in punishment) through the lips of Assyrian conquerors (<a href='/NABRE/23/28/11'>ISA 28:11-12</a>). Paul compresses Isaiahs text and makes God address his people directly. Equating tongues with foreign languages (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/14/10'>1CO 14:10-11</a>), Paul concludes from Isaiah that tongues are a sign not for those who believe, i.e., not a mark of Gods pleasure for those who listen to him but a mark of his displeasure with those in the community who are faithless, who have not heeded the message that he has sent through the prophets."
NABRE,46,14,23,"[8] 14:23-25 Paul projects the possible missionary effect of two hypothetical liturgical experiences, one consisting wholly of tongues, the other entirely of prophecy. Uninstructed(idiōtai): the term may simply mean people who do not speak or understand tongues, as in <a href='/NABRE/46/14/16'>1CO 14:16</a>, where it seems to designate Christians. But coupled with the term ""unbelievers"" it may be another way of designating those who have not been initiated into the community of faith; some believe it denotes a special class of non-Christians who are close to the community, such as catechumens. Unbelievers(apistoi): he has shifted from the inner-community perspective of <a href='/NABRE/46/14/22'>1CO 14:22</a>; the term here designates non-Christians (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/6/6'>1CO 6:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/7/15'>7:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/10/27'>10:27</a>)."
NABRE,46,14,26,"[9] 14:26-33a Paul concludes with specific directives regarding exercise of the gifts in their assemblies. Verse 26 enunciates the basic criterion in the use of any gift: it must contribute to ""building up."""
NABRE,46,14,33,"[10] 14:33b-36 Verse 33b may belong with what precedes, so that the new paragraph would begin only with <a href='/NABRE/46/14/34'>1CO 14:34</a>. <a href='/NABRE/46/14/34'>1CO 14:34-35</a> change the subject. These two verses have the theme of submission in common with <a href='/NABRE/46/14/11'>1CO 14:11</a> despite differences in vocabulary, and a concern with what is or is not becoming; but it is difficult to harmonize the injunction to silence here with <a href='/NABRE/46/11/1'>1CO 11</a> which appears to take it for granted that women do pray and prophesy aloud in the assembly (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/11/5'>1CO 11:5, 13</a>). Hence the verses are often considered an interpolation, reflecting the discipline of later churches; such an interpolation would have to have antedated our manuscripts, all of which contain them, though some transpose them to the very end of the chapter."
NABRE,46,15,1,"[1] 15:1-11 Paul recalls the tradition (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/3'>1CO 15:3-7</a>), which he can presuppose as common ground and which provides a starting point for his argument. This is the fundamental content of all Christian preaching and belief (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/1'>1CO 15:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/15/11'>11</a>)."
NABRE,46,15,3,"[2] 15:3-7 The language by which Paul expresses the essence of the ""gospel"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/1'>1CO 15:1</a>) is not his own but is drawn from older credal formulas. This credo highlights Jesus death for our sins (confirmed by his burial) and Jesus resurrection (confirmed by his appearances) and presents both of them as fulfillment of prophecy. In accordance with the scriptures: conformity of Jesus passion with the scriptures is asserted in <a href='/NABRE/40/16/1'>MAT 16:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/24/25'>LUK 24:25-27</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/24/32'>32</a>, <a href='/NABRE/42/24/44'>44-46</a>. Application of some Old Testament texts (<a href='/NABRE/19/2/7'>PS 2:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/16/8'>16:8-11</a>) to his resurrection is illustrated by <a href='/NABRE/44/2/27'>ACT 2:27-31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/29'>13:29-39</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/23/52/13'>ISA 52:13</a>-<a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>53:12</a> and <a href='/NABRE/28/6/2'>HOS 6:2</a> may also have been envisaged."
NABRE,46,15,9,"[3] 15:9-11 A persecutor may have appeared disqualified (ouk…hikanos) from apostleship, but in fact Gods grace has qualified him. Cf. the remarks in 2 Corinthians about his qualifications (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/16'>2CO 2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/3/5'>3:5</a>) and his greater labors (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/23'>2CO 11:23</a>). These verses are parenthetical, but a nerve has been touched (the references to his abnormal birth and his activity as a persecutor may echo taunts from Pauls opponents), and he is instinctively moved to self-defense."
NABRE,46,15,12,"[4] 15:12-19 Denial of the resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/12'>1CO 15:12</a>) involves logical inconsistencies. The basic one, stated twice (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/13'>1CO 15:13, 16</a>), is that if there is no such thing as (bodily) resurrection, then it has not taken place even in Christs case."
NABRE,46,15,17,"[5] 15:17-18 The consequences for the Corinthians are grave: both forgiveness of sins and salvation are an illusion, despite their strong convictions about both. Unless Christ is risen, their faith does not save."
NABRE,46,15,19,"[6] 15:20-28 After a triumphant assertion of the reality of Christs resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/20'>1CO 15:20</a>a), Paul explains its positive implications and consequences. As a soteriological event of both human (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/20'>1CO 15:20-23</a>) and cosmic (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/24'>1CO 15:24-28</a>) dimensions, Jesus resurrection logically and necessarily involves ours as well."
NABRE,46,15,20,"[7] The firstfruits: the portion of the harvest offered in thanksgiving to God implies the consecration of the entire harvest to come. Christs resurrection is not an end in itself; its finality lies in the whole harvest, ourselves."
NABRE,46,15,21,"[8] 15:21-22 Our human existence, both natural and supernatural, is corporate, involves solidarity. In Adam…in Christ: the Hebrew word ādāmin Genesis is both a common noun for mankind and a proper noun for the first man. Paul here presents Adam as at least a literary type of Christ; the parallelism and contrast between them will be developed further in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/45'>1CO 15:45-49</a> and in <a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>ROM 5:12-21</a>."
NABRE,46,15,24,"[9] 15:24-28 Pauls perspective expands to cosmic dimensions, as he describes the climax of history, the end. His viewpoint is still christological, as in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/20'>1CO 15:20-23</a>. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/24'>1CO 15:24, 28</a> describe Christs final relations to his enemies and his Father in language that is both royal and military; <a href='/NABRE/46/15/25'>1CO 15:25-28</a> insert a proof from scripture (<a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/8/6'>8:6</a>) into this description. But the viewpoint is also theological, for God is the ultimate agent and end, and likewise soteriological, for we are the beneficiaries of all the action."
NABRE,46,15,26,"[10] The last enemy…is death: a parenthesis that specifies the final fulfillment of the two Old Testament texts just referred to, <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/19/8/7'>PS 8:7</a>. Death is not just one cosmic power among many, but the ultimate effect of sin in the universe (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/56'>1CO 15:56</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>ROM 5:12</a>). Christ defeats death where it prevails, in our bodies. The destruction of the last enemy is concretely the ""coming to life"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/22'>1CO 15:22</a>) of ""those who belong to Christ"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/23'>1CO 15:23</a>)."
NABRE,46,15,27,"[11] 15:27b-28 The one who subjected everything to him: the Father is the ultimate agent in the drama, and the final end of the process, to whom the Son and everything else is ordered (24, 28). That God may be all in all: his reign is a dynamic exercise of creative power, an outpouring of life and energy through the universe, with no further resistance. This is the supremely positive meaning of ""subjection"": that God may fully be God."
NABRE,46,15,28,[12] 15:29-34 Paul concludes his treatment of logical inconsistencies with a listing of miscellaneous Christian practices that would be meaningless if the resurrection were not a fact.
NABRE,46,15,29,"[13] Baptized for the dead: this practice is not further explained here, nor is it necessarily mentioned with approval, but Paul cites it as something in their experience that attests in one more way to belief in the resurrection."
NABRE,46,15,30,"[14] 15:30-34 A life of sacrifice, such as Paul describes in <a href='/NABRE/46/4/9'>1CO 4:9-13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/4/2'>2</a> Corinthians, would be pointless without the prospect of resurrection; a life of pleasure, such as that expressed in the Epicurean slogan of <a href='/NABRE/46/15/32'>1CO 15:32</a>, would be far more consistent. I fought with beasts: since Paul does not elsewhere mention a combat with beasts at Ephesus, he may be speaking figuratively about struggles with adversaries."
NABRE,46,15,35,"[15] 15:35-58 Paul imagines two objections that the Corinthians could raise: one concerning the manner of the resurrection (how?), the other pertaining to the qualities of the risen body (what kind?). These questions probably lie behind their denial of the resurrection (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/12'>1CO 15:12</a>), and seem to reflect the presumption that no kind of body other than the one we now possess would be possible. Paul deals with these objections in inverse order, in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/36'>1CO 15:36-49</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/15/50'>1CO 15:50-58</a>. His argument is fundamentally theological and its appeal is to the understanding."
NABRE,46,15,35,"[16] 15:35-49 Paul approaches the question of the nature of the risen body (what kind of body?) by means of two analogies: the seed (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/36'>1CO 15:36-44</a>) and the first man, Adam (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/45'>1CO 15:45-49</a>)."
NABRE,46,15,36,"[17] 15:36-38 The analogy of the seed: there is a change of attributes from seed to plant; the old life-form must be lost for the new to emerge. By speaking about the seed as a bodythat dies and comes to life, Paul keeps the point of the analogy before the readers mind."
NABRE,46,15,39,"[18] 15:39-41 The expression ""its own body"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/38'>1CO 15:38</a>) leads to a development on the marvelous diversity evident in bodily life."
NABRE,46,15,42,"[19] 15:42-44 The principles of qualitative difference before and after death (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/36'>1CO 15:36-38</a>) and of diversity on different levels of creation (<a href='/NABRE/46/15/39'>1CO 15:39-41</a>) are now applied to the human body. Before: a body animated by a lower, natural life-principle (psychē) and endowed with the properties of natural existence (corruptibility, lack of glory, weakness). After: a body animated by a higher life-principle (pneuma; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/45'>1CO 15:45</a>) and endowed with other qualities (incorruptibility, glory, power, spirituality), which are properties of God himself."
NABRE,46,15,45,"[20] The analogy of the first man, Adam, is introduced by a citation from <a href='/NABRE/1/2/7'>GEN 2:7</a>. Paul alters the text slightly, adding the adjective first, and translating the Hebrew ādāmtwice, so as to give it its value both as a common noun (man) and as a proper name (Adam). <a href='/NABRE/46/15/45'>1CO 15:45</a>b then specifies similarities and differences between the two Adams. The last Adam, Christ (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/21'>1CO 15:21-22</a>) has become a…spirit(pneuma), a life-principle transcendent with respect to the natural soul (psychē) of the first Adam (on the terminology here, cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/46/3/1'>1CO 3:1</a>). Further, he is not just alive, but life-giving, a source of life for others."
NABRE,46,15,49,"[21] We shall also bear the image: although it has less manuscript support, this reading better fits the contexts emphasis on futurity and the transforming action of God; on future transformation as conformity to the image of the Son, cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/8/29'>ROM 8:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/3/21'>PHL 3:21</a>. The majority reading, ""let us bear the image,"" suggests that the image of the heavenly man is already present and exhorts us to conform to it."
NABRE,46,15,50,"[22] 15:50-57 These verses, an answer to the first question of <a href='/NABRE/46/15/35'>1CO 15:35</a>, explain theologically how the change of properties from one image to another will take place: God has the power to transform, and he will exercise it."
NABRE,46,15,50,"[23] 15:50-53 Flesh and blood…corruption: living persons and the corpses of the dead, respectively. In both cases, the gulf between creatures and God is too wide to be bridged unless God himself transforms us."
NABRE,46,15,51,"[24] 15:51-52 A mystery: the last moment in Gods plan is disclosed; cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/46/2/1'>1CO 2:1</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/2/7'>7-10</a>a. The final trumpet and the awakening of the dead are stock details of the apocalyptic scenario. We shall not all fall asleep: Paul expected that some of his contemporaries might still be alive at Christs return; after the death of Paul and his whole generation, copyists altered this statement in various ways. We will all be changed: the statement extends to all Christians, for Paul is not directly speaking about anyone else. Whether they have died before the end or happen still to be alive, all must be transformed."
NABRE,46,15,54,"[25] 15:54-55 Death is swallowed up in victory: scripture itself predicts deaths overthrow. O death: in his prophetic vision Paul may be making Hoseas words his own, or imagining this cry of triumph on the lips of the risen church."
NABRE,46,15,56,"[26] The sting of death is sin: an explanation of Hoseas metaphor. Death, scorpion-like, is equipped with a sting, sin, by which it injects its poison. Christ defeats sin, the cause of death (<a href='/NABRE/1/3/19'>GEN 3:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/5/12'>ROM 5:12</a>)."
NABRE,46,16,1,[1] 16:1-4 This paragraph contains our earliest evidence for a project that became a major undertaking of Pauls ministry. The collection for the church at Jerusalem was a symbol in his mind for the unity of Jewish and Gentile Christianity. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/2/10'>GAL 2:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/15/25'>ROM 15:25-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>9</a> and the notes to this last passage.
NABRE,46,16,1,"[2] In regard to the collection: it has already begun in Galatia and Macedonia (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>), and presumably he has already instructed the Corinthians about its purpose."
NABRE,46,16,4,[3] That I should go also: presumably Paul delivered the collection on his final visit to Jerusalem; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/15/25'>ROM 15:25-32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/24/14'>ACT 24:14</a>.
NABRE,46,16,4,[4] 16:5-12 The travel plans outlined here may not have materialized precisely as Paul intended; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/8'>2CO 1:8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/7/4'>7:4-16</a>.
NABRE,46,16,8,[5] In Ephesus until Pentecost: this tells us the place from which he wrote the letter and suggests he may have composed it about Easter time (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/5/7'>1CO 5:7-8</a>).
NABRE,46,16,19,"[6] 16:19-24 These paragraphs conform to the normal epistolary conclusion, but their language is overlaid with liturgical coloration as well. The greetingsof the Asian churches are probably to be read, along with the letter, in the liturgy at Corinth, and the union of the church is to be expressed by a holy kiss (<a href='/NABRE/46/16/19'>1CO 16:19-20</a>). Paul adds to this his own greeting (<a href='/NABRE/46/16/21'>1CO 16:21</a>) and blessings (<a href='/NABRE/46/16/23'>1CO 16:23-24</a>)."
NABRE,46,16,22,"[7] Accursed: literally, ""anathema."" This expression (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/12/3'>1CO 12:3</a>) is a formula for exclusion from the community; it may imply here a call to self-examination before celebration of the Eucharist, in preparation for the Lords coming and judgment (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/11/17'>1CO 11:17-34</a>). Marana tha: an Aramaic expression, probably used in the early Christian liturgy. As understood here (""O Lord, come!""), it is a prayer for the early return of Christ. If the Aramaic words are divided differently (Maran atha, ""Our Lord has come""), it becomes a credal declaration. The former interpretation is supported by what appears to be a Greek equivalent of this acclamation in <a href='/NABRE/66/22/20'>REV 22:20</a> ""Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!"""
NABRE,47,1,1,"[1] 1:1-11 The opening follows the usual Pauline form, except that the thanksgiving takes the form of a doxology or glorification of God (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/3'>2CO 1:3</a>). This introduces a meditation on the experience of suffering and encouragement shared by Paul and the Corinthians (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/4'>2CO 1:4-7</a>), drawn, at least in part, from Pauls reflections on a recent affliction (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/8'>2CO 1:8-10</a>). The section ends with a modified and delayed allusion to thanksgiving (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/11'>2CO 1:11</a>)."
NABRE,47,1,3,"[2] God of all encouragement: Paul expands a standard Jewish blessing so as to state the theme of the paragraph. The theme of ""encouragement"" or ""consolation"" (paraklēsis) occurs ten times in this opening, against a background formed by multiple references to ""affliction"" and ""suffering."""
NABRE,47,1,5,"[3] Through Christ: the Father of compassion is the Father of our Lord Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/3'>2CO 1:3</a>); Pauls sufferings and encouragement (or ""consolation"") are experienced in union with Christ. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/2/25'>LUK 2:25</a>: the ""consolation of Israel"" is Jesus himself."
NABRE,47,1,7,"[4] You also share in the encouragement: the eschatological reversal of affliction and encouragement that Christians expect (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/5/4'>MAT 5:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/6/24'>LUK 6:24</a>) permits some present experience of reversal in the Corinthians case, as in Pauls."
NABRE,47,1,8,"[5] Asia: a Roman province in western Asia Minor, the capital of which was Ephesus."
NABRE,47,1,9,[6] 1:9-10 The sentence of death: it is unclear whether Paul is alluding to a physical illness or to an external threat to life. The result of the situation was to produce an attitude of faith in God alone. God who raises the dead: rescue is the constant pattern of Gods activity; his final act of encouragement is the resurrection.
NABRE,47,1,12,"[7] 1:12-2:13 The autobiographical remarks about the crisis in Asia Minor lead into consideration of a crisis that has arisen between Paul and the Corinthians. Paul will return to this question, after a long digression, in <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5-16</a>. Both of these sections deal with travel plans Paul had made, changes in the plans, alternative measures adopted, a breach that opened between him and the community, and finally a reconciliation between them."
NABRE,47,1,12,"[8] 1:12-14 Since Pauls own conduct will be under discussion here, he prefaces the section with a statement about his habitual behavior and attitude toward the community. He protests his openness, single-mindedness, and conformity to Gods grace; he hopes that his relationship with them will be marked by mutual understanding and pride, which will constantly increase until it reaches its climax at the judgment. Two references to boasting frame this paragraph (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12, 14</a>), the first appearances of a theme that will be important in the letter, especially in <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a>; the term is used in a positive sense here (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/46/1/29'>1CO 1:29-31</a>)."
NABRE,47,1,15,"[9] I formerly intended to come: this plan reads like a revision of the one mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/46/16/5'>1CO 16:5</a>. Not until <a href='/NABRE/47/1/23'>2CO 1:23</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/2/1'>2:1</a> will Paul tell us something his original readers already knew, that he has canceled one or the other of these projected visits."
NABRE,47,1,17,"[10] Did I act lightly?: the subsequent change of plans casts suspicion on the original intention, creating the impression that Paul is vacillating and inconsistent or that human considerationskeep dictating shifts in his goals and projects (cf. the counterclaim of <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12</a>). ""Yes, yes"" and ""no, no"": stating something and denying it in the same or the next breath; being of two minds at once, or from one moment to the next."
NABRE,47,1,18,"[11] 1:18-22 As God is faithful: unable to deny the change in plans, Paul nonetheless asserts the firmness of the original plan and claims a profound constancy in his life and work. He grounds his defense in God himself, who is firm and reliable; this quality can also be predicated in various ways of those who are associated with him. Christ, Paul, and the Corinthians all participate in analogous ways in the constancy of God. A number of the terms here, which appear related only conceptually in Greek or English, would be variations of the same root, mn, in a Semitic language, and thus naturally associated in a Semitic mind, such as Pauls. These include the words yes(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/17'>2CO 1:17-20</a>), faithful(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/18'>2CO 1:18</a>), Amen(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/20'>2CO 1:20</a>), gives us security(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/21'>2CO 1:21</a>), faith, stand firm(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/24'>2CO 1:24</a>)."
NABRE,47,1,21,"[12] 1:21-22 The commercial terms gives us security, seal, first installmentare here used analogously to refer to the process of initiation into the Christian life, perhaps specifically to baptism. The passage is clearly trinitarian. The Spirit is the first installmentor ""down payment"" of the full messianic benefits that God guarantees to Christians. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/1/13'>EPH 1:13-14</a>."
NABRE,47,1,23,"[13] 1:23-24 I have not yet gone to Corinth: some suppose that Paul received word of some affair in Corinth, which he decided to regulate by letter even before the first of his projected visits (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/16'>2CO 1:16</a>). Others conjecture that he did pay the first visit, was offended there (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/2/5'>2CO 2:5</a>), returned to Ephesus, and sent a letter (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/3'>2CO 2:3-9</a>) in place of the second visit. The expressions to spare you(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/23'>2CO 1:23</a>) and work together for your joy(<a href='/NABRE/47/1/24'>2CO 1:24</a>) introduce the major themes of the next two paragraphs, which are remarkable for insistent repetition of key words and ideas. These form two clusters of terms in the English translation: (1) cheer, rejoice, encourage, joy; (2) pain, affliction, anguish. These clusters reappear when Paul resumes treatment of this subject in <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5-16</a>."
NABRE,47,2,3,"[1] 2:3-4 I wrote as I did: we learn for the first time about the sending of a letter in place of the proposed visit. Paul mentions the letter in passing, but emphasizes his motivation in sending it: to avoid being saddened by them (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/2/1'>1CO 2:1</a>), and to help them realize the depth of his love. Another motive will be added in <a href='/NABRE/47/7/12'>2CO 7:12</a>—to bring to light their own concern for him. With many tears: it has been suggested that we may have all or part of this ""tearful letter"" somewhere in the Corinthian correspondence, either in <a href='/NABRE/46/5/1'>1CO 5</a> (the case of the incestuous man), or in 1 Corinthians as a whole, or in <a href='/NABRE/47/2/10'>2CO 2:10-13</a>. None of these hypotheses is entirely convincing. See note on <a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>2CO 13:1</a>."
NABRE,47,2,4,"[2] 2:5-11 The nature of the pain(<a href='/NABRE/47/2/5'>2CO 2:5</a>) is unclear, though some believe an individual at Corinth rejected Pauls authority, thereby scandalizing many in the community. In any case, action has been taken, and Paul judges the measures adequate to right the situation (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/6'>2CO 2:6</a>). The follow-up directives he now gives are entirely positive: forgive, encourage, love. Overwhelmed(<a href='/NABRE/47/2/7'>2CO 2:7</a>): a vivid metaphor (literally ""swallowed"") that Paul employs positively at <a href='/NABRE/47/5/4'>2CO 5:4</a> and in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/54'>1CO 15:54</a> (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/7'>2CO 2:7</a>). It is often used to describe satanic activity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/60/5/8'>1PE 5:8</a>); note the reference to Satan here in <a href='/NABRE/47/2/11'>2CO 2:11</a>."
NABRE,47,2,11,"[3] 2:12-13 I had no relief: Paul does not explain the reason for his anxiety until he resumes the thread of his narrative at <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5</a>: he was waiting to hear how the Corinthians would respond to his letter. Since <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5-16</a> describes their response in entirely positive terms, we never learn in detail why he found it necessary to defend and justify his change of plans, as in <a href='/NABRE/47/1/15'>2CO 1:15-24</a>. Was this portion of the letter written before the arrival of Titus with his good news (<a href='/NABRE/47/7/6'>2CO 7:6-7</a>)?"
NABRE,47,2,13,[4] Macedonia: a Roman province in northern Greece.
NABRE,47,2,14,"[5] 2:14-7:4 This section constitutes a digression within the narrative of the crisis and its resolution (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2:13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5-16</a>). The main component (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2CO 2:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/6/10'>6:10</a>) treats the nature of Pauls ministry and his qualifications for it; this material bears some similarity to the defense of his ministry in chaps. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a>, but it may well come from a period close to the crisis. This is followed by a supplementary block of material quite different in character and tone (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/14'>2CO 6:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/7/1'>7:1</a>). These materials may have been brought together into their present position during final editing of the letter; appeals to the Corinthians link them to one another (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/11'>2CO 6:11-13</a>) and lead back to the interrupted narrative (<a href='/NABRE/47/7/2'>2CO 7:2-4</a>)."
NABRE,47,2,14,"[6] 2:14-6:10 The question of Pauls adequacy (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/16'>2CO 2:16</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/5'>2CO 3:5</a>) and his credentials (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>2CO 3:1-2</a>) has been raised. Paul responds by an extended treatment of the nature of his ministry. It is a ministry of glory (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>2CO 3:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/4/6'>4:6</a>), of life (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>2CO 4:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/5/10'>5:10</a>), of reconciliation (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/11'>2CO 5:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/6/10'>6:10</a>)."
NABRE,47,2,14,[7] 2:14-16a The initial statement plunges us abruptly into another train of thought. Paul describes his personal existence and his function as a preacher in two powerful images (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2CO 2:14</a>) that constitute a prelude to the development to follow.
NABRE,47,2,14,"[8] 2:14a Leads us in triumph in Christ: this metaphor of a festive parade in honor of a conquering military hero can suggest either a positive sharing in Christs triumph or an experience of defeat, being led in captivity and submission (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/4/8'>2CO 4:8-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/4/9'>1CO 4:9</a>). Paul is probably aware of the ambiguity, as he is in the case of the next metaphor."
NABRE,47,2,14,"[9] 2:14b-16a The odor of the knowledge of him: incense was commonly used in triumphal processions. The metaphor suggests the gradual diffusion of the knowledge of God through the apostolic preaching. The aroma of Christ: the image shifts from the fragrance Paul diffuses to the aroma that he is. Paul is probably thinking of the ""sweet odor"" of the sacrifices in the Old Testament (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/1/8/21'>GEN 8:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/2/29/18'>EXO 29:18</a>) and perhaps of the metaphor of wisdom as a sweet odor (<a href='/NABRE/71/24/15'>SIR 24:15</a>). Death…life: the aroma of Christ that comes to them through Paul is perceived differently by various classes of people. To some his preaching and his life (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/1/17'>1CO 1:17</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/2/6'>2:6</a>) are perceived as death, and the effect is death for them; others perceive him, despite appearances, as life, and the effect is life for them. This fragrance thus produces a separation and a judgment (cf. the function of the ""light"" in Johns gospel)."
NABRE,47,2,16,"[10] 2:16b-17 Qualified: Paul may be echoing either the self-satisfied claims of other preachers or their charges about Pauls deficiencies. No one is really qualified, but the apostle contrasts himself with those who dilute or falsify the preaching for personal advantage and insists on his totally good conscience: his ministry is from God, and he has exercised it with fidelity and integrity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/5'>2CO 3:5-6</a>)."
NABRE,47,3,1,"[1] Paul seems to allude to certain preachers who pride themselves on their written credentials. Presumably they reproach him for not possessing similar credentials and compel him to spell out his own qualifications (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/2'>2CO 4:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/5/12'>5:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/6/4'>6:4</a>). The Corinthians themselves should have performed this function for Paul (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/12'>2CO 5:12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>2CO 12:11</a>). Since he is forced to find something that can recommend him, he points to them: their very existence constitutes his letterof recommendation (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>2CO 3:1-2</a>). Others who engage in self-commendation will also be mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/47/10/12'>2CO 10:12-18</a>."
NABRE,47,3,2,"[2] 3:2-3 Mention of ""letters of recommendation"" generates a series of metaphors in which Paul plays on the word ""letter"": (1) the community is Pauls letter of recommendation (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/2'>2CO 3:2</a>a); (2) they are a letter engraved on his affections for all to see and read (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/2'>2CO 3:2</a>b); (3) they are a letter from Christ that Paul merely delivers (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>2CO 3:3</a>a); (4) they are a letter written by the Spirit on the tablets of human hearts (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>2CO 3:3</a>b). One image dissolves into another."
NABRE,47,3,3,"[3] This verse contrasts Pauls letter with those written…in ink(like the credentials of other preachers) and those written…on tablets of stone(like the law of Moses). These contrasts suggest that the other preachers may have claimed special relationship with Moses. If they were Judaizers zealous for the Mosaic law, that would explain the detailed contrast between the old and the new covenants (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>4:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/6/10'>6:10</a>). If they were charismatics who claimed Moses as their model, that would explain the extended treatment of Moses himself and his glory (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>2CO 3:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/4/6'>4:6</a>). Hearts of flesh: cf. Ezekiels contrast between the heart of flesh that the Spirit gives and the heart of stone that it replaces (<a href='/NABRE/26/36/26'>EZE 36:26</a>); the context is covenant renewal and purification that makes observance of the law possible."
NABRE,47,3,4,"[4] 3:4-6 These verses resume <a href='/NABRE/47/2/1'>2CO 2:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>3:3</a>. Pauls confidence (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/4'>2CO 3:4</a>) is grounded in his sense of God-given mission (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/17'>2CO 2:17</a>), the specifics of which are described in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>2CO 3:1-3</a>. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/5'>2CO 3:5-6</a> return to the question of his qualifications (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/16'>2CO 2:16</a>), attributing them entirely to God. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6</a> further spells out the situation described in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>2CO 3:3</a>b and ""names"" it: Paul is living within a new covenant, characterized by the Spirit, which gives life. The usage of a new covenantis derived from <a href='/NABRE/24/31/31'>JER 31:31-33</a> a passage that also speaks of writing on the heart; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/2'>2CO 3:2</a>."
NABRE,47,3,6,"[5] This verse serves as a topic sentence for <a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>2CO 3:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/6/10'>6:10</a>. For the contrast between letterand spirit, cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/2/29'>ROM 2:29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/7/5'>7:5-6</a>."
NABRE,47,3,7,"[6] 3:7-4:6 Paul now develops the contrast enunciated in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6</a>b in terms of the relative glory of the two covenants, insisting on the greater glory of the new. His polemic seems directed against individuals who appeal to the glorious Moses and fail to perceive any comparable glory either in Pauls life as an apostle or in the gospel he preaches. He asserts in response that Christians have a glory of their own that far surpasses that of Moses."
NABRE,47,3,7,"[7] The ministry of death: from his very first words, Paul describes the Mosaic covenant and ministry from the viewpoint of their limitations. They lead to deathrather than life (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6-7</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>2CO 4:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/5/10'>5:10</a>), to condemnationrather than reconciliation (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/9'>2CO 3:9</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/5/11'>2CO 5:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/6/10'>6:10</a>). Was so glorious: the basic text to which Paul alludes is <a href='/NABRE/2/34/29'>EXO 34:29-35</a> to which his opponents have undoubtedly laid claim. Going to fade: Paul concedes the glory of Moses covenant and ministry, but grants them only temporary significance."
NABRE,47,3,8,"[8] 3:8-11 How much more: the argument ""from the less to the greater"" is repeated three times (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/8'>2CO 3:8, 9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/3/11'>11</a>). <a href='/NABRE/47/3/10'>2CO 3:10</a> expresses another point of view: the difference in glory is so great that only the new covenant and ministry can properly be called ""glorious"" at all."
NABRE,47,3,12,"[9] Such hope: the glory is not yet an object of experience, but that does not lessen Pauls confidence. Boldly: the term parrēsiaexpresses outspoken declaration of Christian conviction (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/4/1'>2CO 4:1-2</a>). Paul has nothing to hide and no reason for timidity."
NABRE,47,3,13,"[10] 3:13-14a Not like Moses: in Exodus Moses veiled his face to protect the Israelites from Gods reflected glory. Without impugning Moses sincerity, Paul attributes another effect to the veil. Since it lies between Gods glory and the Israelites, it explains how they could fail to notice the glory disappearing. Their thoughts were rendered dull: the problem lay with their understanding. This will be expressed in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/14'>2CO 3:14</a>b-16 by a shift in the place of the veil: it is no longer over Moses face but over their perception."
NABRE,47,3,14,"[11] 3:14b-16 The parallelism in these verses makes it necessary to interpret corresponding parts in relation to one another. To this present day: this signals the shift of Pauls attention to his contemporaries; his argument is typological, as in <a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>1CO 10</a>. The Israelites of Moses time typify the Jews of Pauls time, and perhaps also Christians of Jewish origin or mentality who may not recognize the temporary character of Moses glory. When they read the old covenant: the lasting dullness prevents proper appraisal of Moses person and covenant. When his writings are read in the synagogue, a veil still impedes their understanding. Through Christ: i.e., in the new covenant. Whenever a person turns to the Lord: Moses in Exodus appeared before God without the veil and gazed on his face unprotected. Paul applies that passage to converts to Christianity: when they turn to the Lord fully and authentically, the impediment to their understanding is removed."
NABRE,47,3,17,"[12] The Lord is the Spirit: the ""Lord"" to whom the Christian turns (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/16'>2CO 3:16</a>) is the Spirit of whom Paul has been speaking, the life-giving Spirit of the living God (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6, 8</a>), the inaugurator of the new covenant and ministry, who is also the Spirit of Christ. The Spirit of the Lord: the Lord here is the living God (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>2CO 3:3</a>), but there may also be an allusion to Christ as Lord (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/14'>2CO 3:14, 16</a>). Freedom: i.e., from the ministry of death (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>2CO 3:7</a>) and the covenant that condemned (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/9'>2CO 3:9</a>)."
NABRE,47,3,18,"[13] Another application of the veil image. All of us…with unveiled face: Christians (Israelites from whom the veil has been removed) are like Moses, standing in Gods presence, beholding and reflecting his glory. Gazing: the verb may also be translated ""contemplating as in a mirror""; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/6'>2CO 4:6</a> would suggest that the mirror is Christ himself. Are being transformed: elsewhere Paul speaks of transformation, conformity to Jesus, Gods image, as a reality of the end time, and even <a href='/NABRE/47/3/12'>2CO 3:12</a> speaks of the glory as an object of hope. But the life-giving Spirit, the distinctive gift of the new covenant, is already present in the community (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/22'>2CO 1:22</a>, the ""first installment""), and the process of transformation has already begun. Into the same image: into the image of God, which is Christ (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/4'>2CO 4:4</a>)."
NABRE,47,4,1,[1] 4:1-2 A ministry of this sort generates confidence and forthrightness; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/2/17'>2:17</a>.
NABRE,47,4,3,"[2] 4:3-4 Though our gospel is veiled: the final application of the image. Paul has been reproached either for obscurity in his preaching or for his manner of presenting the gospel. But he confidently asserts that there is no veil over his gospel. If some fail to perceive its light, that is because of unbelief. The veil lies over their eyes (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/14'>2CO 3:14</a>), a blindness induced by Satan, and a sign that they are headed for destruction (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/2/15'>2CO 2:15</a>)."
NABRE,47,4,5,"[3] We do not preach ourselves: the light seen in his gospel is the glory of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/4'>2CO 4:4</a>). Far from preaching himself, the preacher should be a transparent medium through whom Jesus is perceived (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/4/10'>2CO 4:10-11</a>). Your slaves: Paul draws attention away from individuals as such and toward their role in relation to God, Christ, and the community; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/3/5'>1CO 3:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/1'>2CO 4:1</a>."
NABRE,47,4,6,"[4] Autobiographical allusion to the episode at Damascus clarifies the origin and nature of Pauls service; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/9/1'>ACT 9:1-19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/3'>22:3-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/26/2'>26:2-18</a>. ""Let light shine out of darkness"": Paul seems to be thinking of <a href='/NABRE/1/1/3'>GEN 1:3</a> and presenting his apostolic ministry as a new creation. There may also be an allusion to <a href='/NABRE/23/9/1'>ISA 9:1</a> suggesting his prophetic calling as servant of the Lord and light to the nations; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/42/6'>ISA 42:6, 16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/49/6'>49:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>60:1-2</a>, and the use of light imagery in <a href='/NABRE/44/26/13'>ACT 26:13-23</a>. To bring to light the knowledge: Pauls role in the process of revelation, expressed at the beginning under the image of the odor and aroma (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2CO 2:14-15</a>), is restated now, at the end of this first moment of the development, in the imagery of light and glory (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/3'>2CO 4:3-6</a>)."
NABRE,47,4,7,"[5] 4:7-5:10 Paul now confronts the difficulty that his present existence does not appear glorious at all; it is marked instead by suffering and death. He deals with this by developing the topic already announced in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>2CO 3:3, 6</a>, asserting his faith in the presence and ultimate triumph of life, in his own and every Christian existence, despite the experience of death."
NABRE,47,4,7,[6] This treasure: the glory that he preaches and into which they are being transformed. In earthen vessels: the instruments God uses are human and fragile; some imagine small terracotta lamps in which light is carried.
NABRE,47,4,8,"[7] 4:8-9 A catalogue of his apostolic trials and afflictions. Yet in these the negative never completely prevails; there is always some experience of rescue, of salvation."
NABRE,47,4,10,"[8] 4:10-11 Both the negative and the positive sides of the experience are grounded christologically. The logic is similar to that of <a href='/NABRE/47/1/3'>2CO 1:3-11</a>. His sufferings are connected with Christs, and his deliverance is a sign that he is to share in Jesus resurrection."
NABRE,47,4,12,"[9] 4:12-15 His experience does not terminate in himself, but in others (12, 15; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/4'>2CO 1:4-5</a>). Ultimately, everything is ordered even beyond the community, toward God (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/15'>2CO 4:15</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/11'>2CO 1:11</a>)."
NABRE,47,4,13,"[10] 4:13-14 Like the psalmist, Paul clearly proclaims his faith, affirming life within himself despite death (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/10'>2CO 4:10-11</a>) and the life-giving effect of his experience upon the church (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/12'>2CO 4:12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/4/14'>14-15</a>). And place us with you in his presence: Paul imagines God presenting him and them to Jesus at the parousia and the judgment; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/2'>2CO 11:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/14/10'>ROM 14:10</a>."
NABRE,47,4,16,"[11] 4:16-18 In a series of contrasts Paul explains the extent of his faith in life. Life is not only already present and revealing itself (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/8'>2CO 4:8-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/4/16'>16</a>) but will outlast his experience of affliction and dying: it is eternal (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/17'>2CO 4:17-18</a>)."
NABRE,47,4,16,"[12] Not discouraged: i.e., despite the experience of death. Paul is still speaking of himself personally, but he assumes his faith and attitude will be shared by all Christians. Our outer self: the individual subject of ordinary perception and observation, in contrast to the interior and hidden self, which undergoes renewal. Is being renewed day by day: this suggests a process that has already begun; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/18'>2CO 3:18</a>. The renewal already taking place even in Pauls dying is a share in the life of Jesus, but this is recognized only by faith (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/13'>2CO 4:13, 18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/5/7'>2CO 5:7</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,1,"[1] Our earthly dwelling: the same contrast is restated in the imagery of a dwelling. The language recalls Jesus saying about the destruction of the temple and the construction of another building not made with hands(<a href='/NABRE/41/14/58'>MAK 14:58</a>), a prediction later applied to Jesus own body (<a href='/NABRE/43/2/20'>JHN 2:20</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,2,"[2] 5:2-5 <a href='/NABRE/47/5/2'>2CO 5:2-3</a> and <a href='/NABRE/47/5/4'>4</a> are largely parallel in structure. We groan, longing: see note on <a href='/NABRE/47/5/5'>2CO 5:5</a>. Clothed with our heavenly habitation: Paul mixes his metaphors, adding the image of the garment to that of the building. Further clothed: the verb means strictly ""to put one garment on over another."" Paul may desire to put the resurrection body on over his mortal body, without dying; <a href='/NABRE/47/5/2'>2CO 5:2, 4</a> permit this meaning but do not impose it. Or perhaps he imagines the resurrection body as a garment put on over the Christ-garment first received in baptism (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/27'>GAL 3:27</a>) and preserved by moral behavior (<a href='/NABRE/45/13/12'>ROM 13:12-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/3/12'>COL 3:12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/22/11'>MAT 22:11-13</a>). Some support for this interpretation may be found in the context; cf. the references to baptism (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/5'>2CO 5:5</a>), to judgment according to works (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/10'>2CO 5:10</a>), and to present renewal (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/16'>2CO 4:16</a>), an idea elsewhere combined with the image of ""putting on"" a new nature (<a href='/NABRE/49/4/22'>EPH 4:22-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/3/1'>COL 3:1-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/51/3/9'>9-10</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,3,"[3] When we have taken it off: the majority of witnesses read ""when we have put it on,"" i.e., when we have been clothed (in the resurrection body), then we shall not be without a body (naked). This seems mere tautology, though some understand it to mean: whether we are ""found"" (by God at the judgment) clothed or naked depends upon whether we have preserved or lost our original investiture in Christ (cf. the previous note). In this case to ""put it on"" does not refer to the resurrection body, but to keeping intact the Christ-garment of baptism. The translation follows the western reading (Codex Bezae, Tertullian), the sense of which is clear: to ""take it off"" is to shed our mortal body in death, after which we shall be clothed in the resurrection body and hence not ""naked"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/51'>1CO 15:51-53</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,4,"[4] We do not wish to be unclothed: a clear allusion to physical death (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/16'>2CO 4:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/5/1'>5:1</a>). Unlike the Greeks, who found dissolution of the body desirable (cf. Socrates), Paul has a Jewish horror of it. He seems to be thinking of the ""intermediate period,"" an interval between death and resurrection. Swallowed up by life: cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/54'>1CO 15:54</a>."
NABRE,47,5,5,"[5] God has created us for resurrected bodily life and already prepares us for it by the gift of the Spirit in baptism. The Spirit as a first installment: the striking parallel to <a href='/NABRE/47/5/1'>2CO 5:1-5</a> in <a href='/NABRE/45/8/17'>ROM 8:17-30</a> describes Christians who have received the ""firstfruits"" (cf. ""first installment"" here) of the Spirit as ""groaning"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/5/2'>2CO 5:2, 4</a> here) for the resurrection, the complete redemption of their bodies. In place of clothing and building, <a href='/NABRE/45/8/1'>ROM 8</a> uses other images for the resurrection: adoption and conformity to the image of the Son."
NABRE,47,5,6,"[6] 5:6-9 Tension between present and future is expressed by another spatial image, the metaphor of the country and its citizens. At present we are like citizens in exile or far away from home. The Lord is the distant homeland, believed in but unseen (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/7'>2CO 5:7</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,10,"[7] We must all appear: the verb is ambiguous: we are scheduled to ""appear"" for judgment, at which we will be ""revealed"" as we are (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/1'>2CO 11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/10'>4:10-11</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,11,"[8] 5:11-15 This paragraph is transitional. Paul sums up much that has gone before. Still playing on the term ""appearance,"" he reasserts his transparency before God and the Corinthians, in contrast to the self-commendation, boasting, and preoccupation with externals that characterize some others (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>3:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/4/6'>4:6</a>). <a href='/NABRE/47/5/14'>2CO 5:14</a> recalls <a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>2CO 3:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/4/6'>4:6</a>, and sums up <a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>2CO 4:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/5/10'>5:10</a>."
NABRE,47,5,13,"[9] Out of our minds: this verse confirms that a concern for ecstasy and charismatic experience may lie behind the discussion about ""glory"" in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/7'>2CO 3:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/4/6'>4:6</a>. Paul also enjoys such experiences but, unlike others, does not make a public display of them or consider them ends in themselves. Rational: the Greek virtue sōphrosynē, to which Paul alludes, implies reasonableness, moderation, good judgment, self-control."
NABRE,47,5,14,"[10] 5:14-15 These verses echo <a href='/NABRE/47/4/14'>2CO 4:14</a> and resume the treatment of ""life despite death"" from <a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>2CO 4:7</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/5/10'>5:10</a>."
NABRE,47,5,16,"[11] 5:16-17 Consequently: the death of Christ described in <a href='/NABRE/47/5/14'>2CO 5:14-15</a> produces a whole new order (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/17'>2CO 5:17</a>) and a new mode of perception (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/16'>2CO 5:16</a>). According to the flesh: the natural mode of perception, characterized as ""fleshly,"" is replaced by a mode of perception proper to the Spirit. Elsewhere Paul contrasts what Christ looks like according to the old criteria (weakness, powerlessness, folly, death) and according to the new (wisdom, power, life); cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/5/15'>2CO 5:15, 21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/1/17'>1CO 1:17</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/3/3'>3:3</a>. Similarly, he describes the paradoxical nature of Christian existence, e.g., in <a href='/NABRE/47/4/10'>2CO 4:10-11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/4/14'>14</a>. A new creation: rabbis used this expression to describe the effect of the entrance of a proselyte or convert into Judaism or of the remission of sins on the Day of Atonement. The new order created in Christis the new covenant (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/6'>2CO 3:6</a>)."
NABRE,47,5,18,"[12] 5:18-21 Paul attempts to explain the meaning of Gods action by a variety of different categories; his attention keeps moving rapidly back and forth from Gods act to his own ministry as well. Who has reconciled us to himself: i.e., he has brought all into oneness. Not counting their trespasses: the reconciliation is described as an act of justification (cf. ""righteousness,"" <a href='/NABRE/47/5/21'>2CO 5:21</a>); this contrasts with the covenant that condemned (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/8'>2CO 3:8</a>). The ministry of reconciliation: Pauls role in the wider picture is described: entrusted with the message of reconciliation (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/19'>2CO 5:19</a>), he is Christs ambassador, through whom God appeals (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/20'>2CO 5:20</a>a). In v 20b Paul acts in the capacity just described."
NABRE,47,5,21,"[13] This is a statement of Gods purpose, expressed paradoxically in terms of sharing and exchange of attributes. As Christ became our righteousness (<a href='/NABRE/46/1/30'>1CO 1:30</a>), we become Gods righteousness (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/5/14'>2CO 5:14-15</a>)."
NABRE,47,6,1,"[1] 6:1-10 This paragraph is a single long sentence in the Greek, interrupted by the parenthesis of <a href='/NABRE/47/5/2'>2CO 5:2</a>. The one main verb is ""we appeal."" In this paragraph Paul both exercises his ministry of reconciliation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/5/20'>2CO 5:20</a>) and describes how his ministry is exercised: the ""message of reconciliation"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/19'>2CO 5:19</a>) is lived existentially in his apostolic experience."
NABRE,47,6,1,"[2] Not to receive…in vain: i.e., conform to the gift of justification and new creation. The context indicates how this can be done concretely: become Gods righteousness (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/21'>2CO 5:21</a>), not live for oneself (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/15'>2CO 5:15</a>) be reconciled with Paul (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/11'>2CO 6:11-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/7/2'>7:2-3</a>)."
NABRE,47,6,2,"[3] In an acceptable time: Paul cites the Septuagint text of <a href='/NABRE/23/49/8'>ISA 49:8</a>; the Hebrew reads ""in a time of favor""; it is parallel to ""on the day of salvation."" Now: God is bestowing favor and salvation at this very moment, as Paul is addressing his letter to them."
NABRE,47,6,3,"[4] Cause no one to stumble: the language echoes that of <a href='/NABRE/46/8/1'>1CO 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>10</a> as does the expression ""no longer live for themselves"" in <a href='/NABRE/47/5/15'>2CO 5:15</a>. That no fault may be found: i.e., at the eschatological judgment (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/4/2'>1CO 4:2-5</a>)."
NABRE,47,6,4,"[5] 6:4a This is the central assertion, the topic statement for the catalogue that follows. We commend ourselves: Pauls self-commendation is ironical (with an eye on the charges mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>2CO 3:1-3</a>) and paradoxical (pointing mostly to experiences that would not normally be considered points of pride but are perceived as such by faith). Cf. also the self-commendation in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/23'>2CO 11:23-29</a>. As ministers of God: the same Greek word, diakonos, means ""minister"" and ""servant""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/23'>2CO 11:23</a>, the central assertion in a similar context, and <a href='/NABRE/46/3/5'>1CO 3:5</a>."
NABRE,47,6,4,[6] 6:4b-5 Through much endurance: this phrase functions as a subtitle; it is followed by an enumeration of nine specific types of trials endured.
NABRE,47,6,6,"[7] 6:6-7a A list of virtuous qualities in two groups of four, the second fuller than the first."
NABRE,47,6,8,"[8] 6:8b-10 A series of seven rhetorically effective antitheses, contrasting negative external impressions with positive inner reality. Paul perceives his existence as a reflection of Jesus own and affirms an inner reversal that escapes outward observation. The final two members illustrate two distinct kinds of paradox or apparent contradiction that are characteristic of apostolic experience."
NABRE,47,6,11,"[9] 6:11-13 Pauls tone becomes quieter, but his appeal for acceptance and affection is emotionally charged. References to the heart and their mutual relations bring the development begun in <a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2CO 2:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/3/3'>3:3</a> to an effective conclusion."
NABRE,47,6,14,"[10] 6:14-7:1 Language and thought shift noticeably here. Suddenly we are in a different atmosphere, dealing with a quite different problem. Both the vocabulary and the thought, with their contrast between good and evil, are more characteristic of Qumran documents or the Book of Revelation than they are of Paul. Hence, critics suspect that this section was inserted by another hand."
NABRE,47,6,14,[11] 6:14-16a The opening injunction to separate from unbelievers is reinforced by five rhetorical questions to make the point that Christianity is not compatible with paganism. Their opposition is emphasized also by the accumulation of five distinct designations for each group. These verses are a powerful statement of Gods holiness and the exclusiveness of his claims.
NABRE,47,6,16,"[12] 6:16c-18 This is a chain of scriptural citations carefully woven together. Gods covenant relation to his people and his presence among them (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/16'>2CO 6:16</a>) is seen as conditioned on cultic separation from the profane and cultically impure (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/17'>2CO 6:17</a>); that relation is translated into the personal language of the parent-child relationship, an extension to the community of the language of <a href='/NABRE/10/7/14'>2SM 7:14</a> (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/18'>2CO 6:18</a>). Some remarkable parallels to this chain are found in the final chapters of Revelation. Gods presence among his people (<a href='/NABRE/66/21/22'>REV 21:22</a>) is expressed there, too, by applying <a href='/NABRE/10/7/14'>2SM 7:14</a> to the community (<a href='/NABRE/66/21/7'>REV 21:7</a>). There is a call to separation (<a href='/NABRE/66/18/4'>REV 18:4</a>) and exclusion of the unclean from the community and its liturgy (<a href='/NABRE/66/21/27'>REV 21:27</a>). The title ""Lord Almighty"" (Pantokratōr) occurs in the New Testament only here in <a href='/NABRE/47/6/18'>2CO 6:18</a> and nine times in Revelation."
NABRE,47,7,2,"[1] 7:2-4 These verses continue the thought of <a href='/NABRE/47/6/11'>2CO 6:11-13</a>, before the interruption of <a href='/NABRE/47/6/14'>2CO 6:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/7/1'>7:1</a>. <a href='/NABRE/47/7/4'>2CO 7:4</a> serves as a transition to the next section: the four themes it introduces (confidence; pride or ""boasting""; encouragement; joy in affliction) are developed in <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5-16</a>. All have appeared previously in the letter."
NABRE,47,7,5,"[2] 7:5-16 This section functions as a peroration or formal summing up of the whole first part of the letter, <a href='/NABRE/47/1/1'>2CO 1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/7/1'>7</a>. It deals with the restoration of right relations between Paul and the Corinthians, and it is marked by fullness and intensity of emotion."
NABRE,47,7,5,"[3] 7:5-7 Paul picks up the thread of the narrative interrupted at <a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2CO 2:13</a> (<a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5</a>) and describes the resolution of the tense situation there depicted (<a href='/NABRE/47/7/6'>2CO 7:6-7</a>). Finally Titus arrives and his coming puts an end to Pauls restlessness (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2CO 2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/7/5'>2CO 7:5</a>), casts out his fears, and reverses his mood. The theme of encouragement and affliction is reintroduced (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/3'>2CO 1:3-11</a>); here, too, encouragement is traced back to God and is described as contagious (<a href='/NABRE/47/7/6'>2CO 7:6</a>). The language of joy and sorrow also reappears in <a href='/NABRE/47/7/7'>2CO 7:7</a> (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/23'>2CO 1:23</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/2/1'>2:1</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/47/1/23'>2CO 1:23-24</a>)."
NABRE,47,7,5,[4] Macedonia: see note on <a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2CO 2:13</a>.
NABRE,47,7,8,"[5] 7:8-12 Paul looks back on the episode from the viewpoint of its ending. The goal of their common activity, promotion of their joy (<a href='/NABRE/47/1/24'>2CO 1:24</a>), has been achieved, despite and because of the sorrow they felt. That sorrow was God-given. Its salutary effects are enumerated fully and impressively in <a href='/NABRE/47/7/10'>2CO 7:10-11</a>; not the least important of these is that it has revealed to them the attachment they have to Paul."
NABRE,47,7,13,"[6] 7:13-16 Paul summarizes the effect of the experience on Titus: encouragement, joy, love, relief. Finally, he describes its effects on himself: encouragement, joy, confidence, pride or ""boasting"" (i.e., the satisfaction resulting from a boast that proves well-founded; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/7/4'>2CO 7:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>1:12, 14</a>)."
NABRE,47,8,1,"[1] 8:1-9:15 Paul turns to a new topic, the collection for the church in Jerusalem. There is an early precedent for this project in the agreement mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/48/2/6'>GAL 2:6-10</a>. According to Acts, the church at Antioch had sent Saul and Barnabas to Jerusalem with relief (<a href='/NABRE/44/11/27'>ACT 11:27-30</a>). Subsequently Paul organized a project of relief for Jerusalem among his own churches. Our earliest evidence for it comes in <a href='/NABRE/46/16/1'>1CO 16:1-4</a>—after it had already begun (see notes there); by the time Paul wrote <a href='/NABRE/45/15/25'>ROM 15:25-28</a> the collection was completed and ready for delivery. <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>9</a> contain what appear to be two letters on the subject. In them Paul gives us his fullest exposition of the meaning he sees in the enterprise, presenting it as an act of Christian charity and as an expression of the unity of the church, both present and eschatological. These chapters are especially rich in the recurrence of key words, on which Paul plays; it is usually impossible to do justice to these wordplays in the translation."
NABRE,47,8,1,"[2] 8:1-24 This is a letter of recommendation for Titus and two unnamed companions, written from Macedonia probably at least a year later than <a href='/NABRE/46/16/1'>1CO 16</a>. The recommendation proper is prefaced by remarks about the ideals of sharing and equality within the Christian community (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8:1-15</a>). <a href='/NABRE/50/4/10'>PHL 4:10-20</a> shows that Paul has reflected on his personal experience of need and relief in his relations with the community at Philippi; he now develops his reflections on the larger scale of relations between his Gentile churches and the mother church in Jerusalem."
NABRE,47,8,1,"[3] 8:1-5 The example of the Macedonians, a model of what ought to be happening at Corinth, provides Paul with the occasion for expounding his theology of ""giving."""
NABRE,47,8,1,"[4] The grace of God: the fundamental theme is expressed by the Greek noun charis, which will be variously translated throughout these chapters as ""grace"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/9/8'>9:8, 14</a>), ""favor"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/4'>2CO 8:4</a>), ""gracious act"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/6'>2CO 8:6, 7</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/8/9'>9</a>) or ""gracious work"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/19'>2CO 8:19</a>), to be compared to ""gracious gift"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/16/3'>1CO 16:3</a>). The related term, eucharistia, ""thanksgiving,"" also occurs at <a href='/NABRE/47/9/11'>2CO 9:11, 12</a>. The wordplay is not superficial; various mutations of the same root signal inner connection between aspects of a single reality, and Paul consciously exploits the similarities in vocabulary to highlight that connection."
NABRE,47,8,2,"[5] Three more terms are now introduced. Test(dokimē): the same root is translated as ""to test"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/8'>2CO 8:8</a>) and ""evidence"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/9/13'>2CO 9:13</a>); it means to be tried and found genuine. Abundance: variations on the same root lie behind ""overflow"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/2'>2CO 8:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/9/12'>9:12</a>), ""excel"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/7'>2CO 8:7</a>), ""surplus"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/14'>2CO 8:14</a>), ""superfluous"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>2CO 9:1</a>) ""make abundant"" and ""have an abundance"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/9/8'>2CO 9:8</a>). These expressions of fullness contrast with references to need (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/14'>2CO 8:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/9/12'>9:12</a>). Generosity: the word haplotēshas nuances of both simplicity and sincerity; here and in <a href='/NABRE/47/9/11'>2CO 9:11, 13</a> it designates the singleness of purpose that manifests itself in generous giving."
NABRE,47,8,3,"[6] 8:3-4 Paul emphasizes the spontaneity of the Macedonians and the nature of their action. They begged us insistently: the same root is translated as ""urge,"" ""appeal,"" ""encourage"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/8/6'>2CO 8:6, 17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/9/5'>9:5</a>). Taking part: the same word is translated ""contribution"" in <a href='/NABRE/47/9/13'>2CO 9:13</a> and a related term as ""partner"" in <a href='/NABRE/47/8/23'>2CO 8:23</a>. Service(diakonia): this word occurs also in <a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>2CO 9:1, 13</a> as ""service""; in <a href='/NABRE/47/9/12'>2CO 9:12</a> it is translated ""administration,"" and in <a href='/NABRE/47/8/19'>2CO 8:19, 20</a> the corresponding verb is rendered ""administer."""
NABRE,47,8,5,[7] They gave themselves…to the Lord and to us: on its deepest level their attitude is one of self-giving.
NABRE,47,8,6,"[8] Titus: <a href='/NABRE/46/16/1'>1CO 16</a> seemed to leave the organization up to the Corinthians, but apparently Paul has sent Titus to initiate the collection as well; <a href='/NABRE/47/8/16'>2CO 8:16-17</a> will describe Titus attitude as one of shared concern and cooperation."
NABRE,47,8,7,"[9] The charitable service Paul is promoting is seen briefly and in passing within the perspective of Pauls theology of the charisms. Earnestness(spoudē): this or related terms occur also in <a href='/NABRE/47/8/22'>2CO 8:22</a> (""earnest"") and <a href='/NABRE/47/8/8'>2CO 8:8, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/8/17'>17</a> (""concern"")."
NABRE,47,8,9,"[10] The dialectic of Jesus experience, expressed earlier in terms of life and death (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/15'>2CO 5:15</a>), sin and righteousness (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/21'>2CO 5:21</a>), is now rephrased in terms of poverty and wealth. Many scholars think this is a reference to Jesus preexistence with God (his ""wealth"") and to his incarnation and death (his ""poverty""), and they point to the similarity between this verse and <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-8</a>. Others interpret the wealth and poverty as succeeding phases of Jesus earthly existence, e.g., his sense of intimacy with God and then the desolation and the feeling of abandonment by God in his death (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/15/34'>MAK 15:34</a>)."
NABRE,47,8,11,"[11] Eager: the word prothymiaalso occurs in <a href='/NABRE/47/8/12'>2CO 8:12, 19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/9/2'>9:2</a>."
NABRE,47,8,12,"[12] 8:12-15 Paul introduces the principle of equalityinto the discussion. The goal is not impoverishment but sharing of resources; balance is achieved at least over the course of time. In <a href='/NABRE/47/8/15'>2CO 8:15</a> Paul grounds his argument unexpectedly in the experience of Israel gathering manna in the desert: equality was achieved, independently of personal exertion, by God, who gave with an even hand according to need. Paul touches briefly here on the theme of ""living from God."""
NABRE,47,8,15,"[13] 8:16-24 In recommending Titus and his companions, Paul stresses their personal and apostolic qualities, their good dispositions toward the Corinthians, and their authority as messengers of the churches and representatives of Christ."
NABRE,47,8,18,"[14] The brother: we do not know the identity of this co-worker of Paul, nor of the third companion mentioned below in <a href='/NABRE/47/8/22'>2CO 8:22</a>."
NABRE,47,8,20,"[15] 8:20-22 That anyone blame us: <a href='/NABRE/47/12/16'>2CO 12:16-18</a> suggests that misunderstandings may indeed have arisen concerning Pauls management of the collection through the messengers mentioned here, but those same verses seem to imply that the Corinthians by and large would recognize the honesty of Pauls conduct in this area as in others (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/6/3'>2CO 6:3</a>)."
NABRE,47,8,24,"[16] As Paul began by holding up the Macedonians as examples to be imitated, he closes by exhorting the Corinthians to show their love (by accepting the envoys and by cooperating as the Macedonians do), thus justifying the pride Paul demonstrates because of them before other churches."
NABRE,47,9,1,"[1] 9:1-15 Quite possibly this was originally an independent letter, though it deals with the same subject and continues many of the same themes. In that case, it may have been written a few weeks later than <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>, while the delegation there mentioned was still on its way."
NABRE,47,9,2,[2] Achaia: see note on <a href='/NABRE/45/15/26'>ROM 15:26</a>.
NABRE,47,9,3,"[3] I sent the brothers: the Greek aorist tense here could be epistolary, referring to the present; in that case Paul would be sending them now, and <a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>2CO 9</a> would merely conclude the letter of recommendation begun in <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>. But the aorist may also refer to a sending that is past as Paul writes; then <a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>2CO 9</a>, with its apparently fresh beginning, is a follow-up message entrusted to another carrier."
NABRE,47,9,8,"[4] 9:8-10 The behavior to which he exhorts them is grounded in Gods own pattern of behavior. God is capable of overwhelming generosity, as scripture itself attests (<a href='/NABRE/47/9/9'>2CO 9:9</a>), so that they need not fear being short. He will provide in abundance, both supplying their natural needs and increasing their righteousness. Paul challenges them to godlike generosity and reminds them of the fundamental motive for encouragement: God himself cannot be outdone."
NABRE,47,9,11,"[5] 9:11-15 Pauls vision broadens to take in all the interested parties in one dynamic picture. His language becomes liturgically colored and conveys a sense of fullness. With a final play on the words charisand eucharistia(see note on <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8:1</a>), he describes a circle that closes on itself: the movement of grace overflowing from God to them and handed on from them through Paul to others is completed by the prayer of praise and thanksgiving raised on their behalf to God."
NABRE,47,10,1,"[1] 10:1-13:10 These final chapters have their own unity of structure and theme and could well have formed the body of a separate letter. They constitute an apologiaon Pauls part, i.e., a legal defense of his behavior and his ministry; the writing is emotionally charged and highly rhetorical. In the central section (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/16'>2CO 11:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/12/10'>12:10</a>), the apologiatakes the form of a boast. This section is prepared for by a prologue (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/1'>2CO 11:1-15</a>) and followed by an epilogue (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>2CO 12:11-18</a>), which are similar in content and structure. These sections, in turn, are framed by an introduction (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-18</a>) and a conclusion (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/19'>2CO 12:19</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/10'>13:10</a>), both of which assert Pauls apostolic authority and confidence and define the purpose of the letter. The structure that results from this disposition of the material is chiastic, i.e., the first element corresponds to the last, the second to the second last, etc., following the pattern a b c b′ a′."
NABRE,47,10,1,[2] 10:1-18 Paul asserts his apostolic authority and expresses the confidence this generates in him. He writes in response to certain opinions that have arisen in the community and certain charges raised against him and in preparation for a forthcoming visit in which he intends to set things in order. This section gives us an initial glimpse of the situation in Corinth that Paul must address; much of its thematic material will be taken up again in the finale (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/19'>2CO 12:19</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/10'>13:10</a>).
NABRE,47,10,1,"[3] 10:1-2 A strong opening plunges us straight into the conflict. Contrasts dominate here: presence versus absence, gentleness-clemency-humility versus boldness-confidence-bravery. Through the gentleness and clemency of Christ: the figure of the gentle Christ, presented in a significant position before any specifics of the situation are suggested, forms a striking contrast to the picture of the bold and militant Paul (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/2'>2CO 10:2-6</a>); this tension is finally resolved in <a href='/NABRE/47/13/3'>2CO 13:3-4</a>. Absent…present: this same contrast, with a restatement of the purpose of the letter, recurs in <a href='/NABRE/47/13/10'>2CO 13:10</a>, which forms an inclusion with <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-2</a>."
NABRE,47,10,2,"[4] 10:2b-4a Flesh: the Greek word sarxcan express both the physical life of the body without any pejorative overtones (as in ""we are in the flesh,"" 3) and our natural life insofar as it is marked by limitation and weakness (as in the other expressions) in contrast to the higher life and power conferred by the Spirit; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/46/3/1'>1CO 3:1</a>. The wordplay is intended to express the paradoxical situation of a life already taken over by the Spirit but not yet seen as such except by faith. Lack of empirical evidence of the Spirit permits misunderstanding and misjudgment, but Paul resolutely denies that his behavior and effectiveness are as limited as some suppose."
NABRE,47,10,3,[5] 10:3b-6 Paul is involved in combat. The strong military language and imagery are both an assertion of his confidence in the divine power at his disposal and a declaration of war against those who underestimate his resources. The threat is echoed in <a href='/NABRE/47/13/2'>2CO 13:2-3</a>.
NABRE,47,10,7,"[6] 10:7-8 Belonging to Christ…so do we: these phrases already announce the pattern of Pauls boast in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/21'>2CO 11:21</a>b-29, especially <a href='/NABRE/47/11/22'>2CO 11:22-23</a>. For building you up and not for tearing you down: Paul draws on the language by which Jeremiah described the purpose of the prophetic power the Lord gave to him (<a href='/NABRE/24/1/9'>JER 1:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/12/16'>12:16-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/24/6'>24:6</a>). Though Pauls power may have destructive effects on others (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/2'>2CO 10:2-6</a>), its intended effect on the community is entirely constructive (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/13/10'>2CO 13:10</a>). I shall not be put to shame: his assertions will not be refuted; they will be revealed as true at the judgment."
NABRE,47,10,9,"[7] 10:9-10 Paul cites the complaints of some who find him lacking in personal forcefulness and holds out the threat of a personal parousia(both ""return"" and ""presence"") that will be forceful, indeed will be a demonstration of Christs own power (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/13/2'>2CO 13:2-4</a>)."
NABRE,47,10,12,"[8] 10:12-18 Paul now qualifies his claim to boldness, indicating its limits. He distinguishes his own behavior from that of others, revealing those ""others"" as they appear to him: as self-recommending, immoderately boastful, encroaching on territory not assigned to them, and claiming credit not due to them."
NABRE,47,10,13,"[9] Will keep to the limits: the notion of proper limits is expressed here by two terms with overlapping meanings, metronand kanōn, which are played off against several expressions denoting overreaching or expansion beyond a legitimate sphere."
NABRE,47,10,17,"[10] Boast in the Lord: there is a legitimate boasting, in contrast to the immoderate boasting to which <a href='/NABRE/47/10/13'>2CO 10:13, 15</a> allude. Gods work through Paul in the community is the object of his boast (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/13'>2CO 10:13-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12-14</a>) and constitutes his recommendation (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>2CO 3:1-3</a>). Cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12-14</a> and <a href='/NABRE/46/1/29'>1CO 1:29-31</a>."
NABRE,47,10,18,"[11] Approved: to be approved is to come successfully through the process of testing for authenticity (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/13/3'>2CO 13:3-7</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/47/8/2'>2CO 8:2</a>). Whom the Lord recommends: self-commendation is a premature and unwarranted anticipation of the final judgment, which the Lord alone will pass (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/4/3'>1CO 4:3-5</a>). Paul alludes to this judgment throughout <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a>, frequently in final or transitional positions; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/15'>2CO 11:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/19'>12:19a</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/13/3'>13:3-7</a>."
NABRE,47,11,1,"[1] 11:1-15 Although these verses continue to reveal information about Pauls opponents and the differences he perceives between them and himself, <a href='/NABRE/47/11/1'>2CO 11:1</a> signals a turn in Pauls thought. This section constitutes a prologue to the boasting that he will undertake in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/16'>2CO 11:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/12/10'>12:10</a>, and it bears remarkable similarities to the section that follows the central boast, <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>2CO 12:11-18</a>."
NABRE,47,11,1,[2] Put up with a little foolishness from me: this verse indicates more clearly than the general statement of intent in <a href='/NABRE/47/10/13'>2CO 10:13</a> the nature of the project Paul is about to undertake. He alludes ironically to the Corinthians toleration for others. Foolishness: Paul qualifies his project as folly from beginning to end; see note on <a href='/NABRE/47/11/16'>2CO 11:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/12/10'>12:10</a>.
NABRE,47,11,2,"[3] Paul gives us a sudden glimpse of the theological values that are at stake. The jealousy of God: the perspective is that of the covenant, described in imagery of love and marriage, as in the prophets; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/10/22'>1CO 10:22</a>. I betrothed you: Paul, like a father (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/12/14'>2CO 12:14</a>), betroths the community to Christ as his bride (cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/5/21'>EPH 5:21-33</a>) and will present her to him at his second coming. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/25/1'>MAT 25:1-13</a> and the nuptial imagery in <a href='/NABRE/66/21/1'>REV 21</a>."
NABRE,47,11,3,"[4] As the serpent deceived Eve: before Christ can return for the community Paul fears a repetition of the primal drama of seduction. Corruption of minds is satanic activity (see <a href='/NABRE/47/2/11'>2CO 2:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/4'>4:4</a>). Satanic imagery recurs in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/13'>2CO 11:13-15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/11/20'>20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/7'>12:7</a>b, 16-17; see notes on these passages."
NABRE,47,11,4,"[5] Preaches another Jesus: the danger is specified, and Pauls opponents are identified with the cunning serpent. The battle for minds has to do with the understanding of Jesus, the Spirit, the gospel; the Corinthians have flirted with another understanding than the one that Paul handed on to them as traditional and normative."
NABRE,47,11,5,"[6] These ""superapostles"": this term, employed again in <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>2CO 12:11</a>b, designates the opponents of whom Paul has spoken in <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a> and again in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/4'>2CO 11:4</a>. They appear to be intruders at Corinth. Their preaching is marked at least by a different emphasis and style, and they do not hesitate to accept support from the community. Perhaps these itinerants appeal to the authority of church leaders in Jerusalem and even carry letters of recommendation from them. But it is not those distant leaders whom Paul is attacking here. The intruders are ""superapostles"" not in the sense of the ""pillars"" at Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/1'>GAL 2</a>), but in their own estimation. They consider themselves superior to Paul as apostles and ministers of Christ, and they are obviously enjoying some success among the Corinthians. Paul rejects their claim to be apostles in any superlative sense (hyperlian), judging them bluntly as ""false apostles,"" ministers of Satan masquerading as apostles of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/13'>2CO 11:13-15</a>). On the contrary, he himself will claim to be a superminister of Christ (hyper egō, <a href='/NABRE/47/11/23'>2CO 11:23</a>)."
NABRE,47,11,6,"[7] Apparently found deficient in both rhetorical ability (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/10'>2CO 10:10</a>) and knowledge (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/5'>2CO 10:5</a>), Paul concedes the former charge but not the latter. In every way: in all their contacts with him revelation has been taking place. Paul, through whom God reveals the knowledge of himself (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/14'>2CO 2:14</a>), and in whom the death and life of Jesus are revealed (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/10'>2CO 4:10-11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/6/4'>2CO 6:4</a>), also demonstrates his own role as the bearer of true knowledge. Cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/1/18'>1CO 1:18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/2/16'>2:16</a>."
NABRE,47,11,7,[8] 11:7-10 Abruptly Paul passes to another reason for complaints: his practice of preaching without remuneration (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/9/3'>1CO 9:3-18</a>). He deftly defends his practice by situating it from the start within the pattern of Christs own self-humiliation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1</a>) and reduces objections to absurdity by rhetorical questions (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/12/13'>2CO 12:13</a>).
NABRE,47,11,11,"[9] 11:11-12 Paul rejects lack of affection as his motive (possibly imputed to him by his opponents) and states his real motive, a desire to emphasize the disparity between himself and the others (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/19'>2CO 11:19-21</a>). The topic of his gratuitous service will be taken up once more in <a href='/NABRE/47/12/13'>2CO 12:13-18</a>. <a href='/NABRE/46/9/15'>1CO 9:15-18</a> gives a different but complementary explanation of his motivation."
NABRE,47,11,13,"[10] 11:13-15 Paul picks up again the imagery of <a href='/NABRE/47/11/3'>2CO 11:3</a> and applies it to the opponents: they are false apostles of Christ, really serving another master. Deceitful…masquerade: deception and simulation, like cunning (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/3'>2CO 11:3</a>), are marks of the satanic. Angel of light: recalls the contrast between light and darkness, Christ and Beliar at <a href='/NABRE/47/6/14'>2CO 6:14-15</a>. Ministers of righteousness: recalls the earlier contrast between the ministry of condemnation and that of righteousness (<a href='/NABRE/47/3/9'>2CO 3:9</a>). Their end: the section closes with another allusion to the judgment, when all participants in the final conflict will be revealed or unmasked and dealt with as they deserve."
NABRE,47,11,16,"[11] 11:16-12:10 Paul now accepts the challenge of his opponents and indulges in boasting similar to theirs, but with differences that he has already signaled in <a href='/NABRE/47/10/12'>2CO 10:12-18</a> and that become clearer as he proceeds. He defines the nature of his project and unmistakably labels it as folly at the beginning and the end (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/16'>2CO 11:16-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>12:11</a>). Yet his boast does not spring from ignorance (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/21'>2CO 11:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/6'>12:6</a>) nor is it concerned merely with human distinctions (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/18'>2CO 11:18</a>). Paul boasts ""in moderation"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/13'>2CO 10:13, 15</a>) and ""in the Lord"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/17'>2CO 10:17</a>)."
NABRE,47,11,16,"[12] 11:16-29 The first part of Pauls boast focuses on labors and afflictions, in which authentic service of Christ consists."
NABRE,47,11,16,[13] 11:16-21 These verses recapitulate remarks already made about the foolishness of boasting and the excessive toleration of the Corinthians. They form a prelude to the boast proper.
NABRE,47,11,20,"[14] Paul describes the activities of the ""others"" in terms that fill out the picture drawn in vv 3-4, 13-15. Much of the vocabulary suggests fleshly or even satanic activity. Enslaves: cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/2/4'>GAL 2:4</a>. Devours: cf. <a href='/NABRE/60/5/8'>1PE 5:8</a>. Gets the better: the verb lambanōmeans ""to take,"" but is used in a variety of senses; here it may imply financial advantage, as in the English colloquialism ""to take someone."" It is similarly used at <a href='/NABRE/47/12/16'>2CO 12:16</a> and is there connected with cunning and deceit. Puts on airs: the same verb is rendered ""raise oneself"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/5'>2CO 10:5</a>) and ""be too elated"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/7'>2CO 12:7</a>)."
NABRE,47,11,21,"[15] Paul ironically concedes the charge of personal weakness from <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-18</a> but will refute the other charge there mentioned, that of lack of boldness, accepting the challenge to demonstrate it by his boast."
NABRE,47,11,22,"[16] The opponents apparently pride themselves on their ""Jewishness."" Paul, too, can claim to be a Jew by race, religion, and promise. Descendants of Abraham: elsewhere Paul distinguishes authentic from inauthentic heirs of Abraham and the promise (<a href='/NABRE/45/4/13'>ROM 4:13-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/9/7'>9:7-13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/11/1'>11:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/9'>GAL 3:9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/3/27'>27-29</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/8/33'>JHN 8:33-47</a>). Here he grants his opponents this title in order to concentrate on the principal claim that follows."
NABRE,47,11,23,[17] 11:23b-29 Service of the humiliated and crucified Christ is demonstrated by trials endured for him. This rhetorically impressive catalogue enumerates many of the labors and perils Paul encountered on his missionary journeys.
NABRE,47,11,23,[18] 11:23a Ministers of Christ…I am still more: the central point of the boast (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/47/11/5'>2CO 11:5</a>). Like an insane person: the climax of his folly.
NABRE,47,11,29,"[19] 11:30-12:10 The second part of Pauls boast, marked by a change of style and a shift in focus. After recalling the project in which he is engaged, he states a new topic: his weaknesses as matter for boasting. Everything in this section, even the discussion of privileges and distinctions, will be integrated into this perspective."
NABRE,47,11,31,[20] 11:31-32 The episode at Damascus is symbolic. It aptly illustrates Pauls weakness but ends in deliverance (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>2CO 4:7-11</a>).
NABRE,47,12,1,"[1] 12:1-4 In the body or out of the body: he seemed no longer confined to bodily conditions, but he does not claim to understand the mechanics of the experience. Caught up: i.e., in ecstasy. The third heaven…Paradise: ancient cosmologies depicted a multitiered universe. Jewish intertestamental literature contains much speculation about the number of heavens. Seven is the number usually mentioned, but the Testament of Levi (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/7'>2:7-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>3:1-4</a>) speaks of three; God himself dwelt in the third of these. Without giving us any clear picture of the cosmos, Paul indicates a mental journey to a nonearthly space, set apart by God, in which secrets were revealed to him. Ineffable things: i.e., privileged knowledge, which it was not possible or permitted to divulge."
NABRE,47,12,5,"[2] 12:5-7 This person: the indirect way of referring to himself has the effect of emphasizing the distance between that experience and his everyday life, just as the indirect someone in Christ(<a href='/NABRE/47/12/2'>2CO 12:2</a>) and all the passive verbs emphasize his passivity and receptivity in the experience. The revelations were not a personal achievement, nor were they meant to draw attention to any quality of his own."
NABRE,47,12,7,"[3] That I might not become too elated: God assures that there is a negative component to his experience, so that he cannot lose proper perspective; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/1/9'>2CO 1:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/7'>4:7-11</a>. A thorn in the flesh: variously interpreted as a sickness or physical disability, a temptation, or a handicap connected with his apostolic activity. But since Hebrew ""thorn in the flesh,"" like English ""thorn in my side,"" refers to persons (cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/33/55'>NUM 33:55</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/28/24'>EZE 28:24</a>), Paul may be referring to some especially persistent and obnoxious opponent. The language of <a href='/NABRE/47/12/7'>2CO 12:7-8</a> permits this interpretation. If this is correct, the frequent appearance of singular pronouns in depicting the opposition may not be merely a stylistic variation; the singular may be provoked and accompanied by the image of one individual in whom criticism of Pauls preaching, way of life, and apostolic consciousness is concentrated, and who embodies all the qualities Paul attributes to the group. An angel of Satan: a personal messenger from Satan; cf. the satanic language already applied to the opponents in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/3'>2CO 11:3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/11/13'>13-15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/11/20'>20</a>."
NABRE,47,12,8,"[4] Three times: his prayer was insistent, like that of Jesus in Gethsemane, a sign of how intolerable he felt the thorn to be."
NABRE,47,12,9,"[5] But he said to me: Pauls petition is denied; release and healing are withheld for a higher purpose. The Greek perfect tense indicates that Jesus earlier response still holds at the time of writing. My grace is sufficient for you: this is not a statement about the sufficiency of grace in general. Jesus speaks directly to Pauls situation. Is made perfect: i.e., is given most fully and manifests itself fully."
NABRE,47,12,9,"[6] 12:9b-10a Paul draws the conclusion from the autobiographical anecdote and integrates it into the subject of this part of the boast. Weaknesses: the apostolic hardships he must endure, including active personal hostility, as specified in a final catalogue (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/10'>2CO 12:10</a>a). That the power of Christ may dwell with me: Paul pinpoints the ground for the paradoxical strategy he has adopted in his self-defense."
NABRE,47,12,10,"[7] When I am weak, then I am strong: Paul recognizes a twofold pattern in the resolution of the weakness-power (and death-life) dialectic, each of which looks to Jesus as the model and is experienced in him. The first is personal, involving a reversal in oneself (Jesus, <a href='/NABRE/47/13/4'>2CO 13:4</a>a; Paul, <a href='/NABRE/47/1/9'>2CO 1:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/10'>4:10-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/6/9'>6:9</a>). The second is apostolic, involving an effect on others (Jesus, <a href='/NABRE/47/5/14'>2CO 5:14-15</a>; Paul, <a href='/NABRE/47/1/6'>2CO 1:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/4/12'>4:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/13/9'>13:9</a>). The specific kind of ""effectiveness in ministry"" that Paul promises to demonstrate on his arrival (<a href='/NABRE/47/13/4'>2CO 13:4</a>b; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-11</a>) involves elements of both; this, too, will be modeled on Jesus experience and a participation in that experience (<a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>2CO 9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/13/3'>13:3</a>b)."
NABRE,47,12,10,"[8] 12:11-18 This brief section forms an epilogue or concluding observation to Pauls boast, corresponding to the prologue in <a href='/NABRE/47/11/1'>2CO 11:1-15</a>. A four-step sequence of ideas is common to these two sections: Paul qualifies his boast as folly (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/1'>2CO 11:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>12:11</a>a), asserts his noninferiority to the ""superapostles"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/5'>2CO 11:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>12:11</a>b), exemplifies this by allusion to charismatic endowments (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/6'>2CO 11:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/12'>12:12</a>), and finally denies that he has been a financial burden to the community (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/7'>2CO 11:7-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/13'>12:13-18</a>)."
NABRE,47,12,12,"[9] Despite weakness and affliction (suggested by the mention of endurance), his ministry has been accompanied by demonstrations of power (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/2/3'>1CO 2:3-4</a>). Signs of an apostle: visible proof of belonging to Christ and of mediating Christs power, which the opponents require as touchstones of apostleship (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/11'>2CO 12:11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/13/3'>2CO 13:3</a>)."
NABRE,47,12,13,"[10] 12:13-18 Paul insists on his intention to continue refusing support from the community (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/8'>2CO 11:8-12</a>). In defending his practice and his motivation, he once more protests his love (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/11/11'>2CO 11:11</a>) and rejects the suggestion of secret self-enrichment. He has recourse here again to language applied to his opponents earlier: ""cunning"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/3'>2CO 11:3</a>), ""deceit"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/13'>2CO 11:13</a>), ""got the better of you"" (see note on <a href='/NABRE/47/11/20'>2CO 11:20</a>), ""take advantage"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/11'>2CO 2:11</a>)."
NABRE,47,12,18,"[11] 12:19-13:10 This concludes the development begun in <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>. In the chiastic arrangement of the material (see note on <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/10'>13:10</a>), this final part corresponds to the opening; there are important similarities of content between the two sections as well."
NABRE,47,12,19,"[12] This verse looks back at the previous chapters and calls them by their proper name, a defense, an apologia(cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/9/3'>1CO 9:3</a>). Yet Paul insists on an important distinction: he has indeed been speaking for their benefit, but the ultimate judgment to which he submits is Gods (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/4/3'>1CO 4:3-5</a>). This verse also leads into the final section, announcing two of its themes: judgment and building up."
NABRE,47,12,20,"[13] I fear that…: earlier Paul expressed fear that the Corinthians were being victimized, exploited, seduced from right thinking by his opponents (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/3'>2CO 11:3-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/11/19'>19-21</a>). Here he alludes unexpectedly to moral disorders among the Corinthians themselves. The catalogue suggests the effects of factions that have grown up around rival apostles."
NABRE,47,12,21,"[14] Again: one can also translate, ""I fear that when I come my God may again humiliate me."" Pauls allusion to the humiliation and mourning that may await him recall the mood he described in <a href='/NABRE/47/2/1'>2CO 2:1-4</a>, but there is no reference here to any individual such as there is in <a href='/NABRE/47/2/5'>2CO 2:5-11</a>. The crisis of <a href='/NABRE/47/2/1'>2CO 2</a> has happily been resolved by integration of the offender and repentance (<a href='/NABRE/47/7/4'>2CO 7:4-16</a>), whereas <a href='/NABRE/47/12/21'>2CO 12:21</a> is preoccupied with still unrepentant sinners. The sexual sins recall <a href='/NABRE/46/5/1'>1CO 5</a>-<a href='/NABRE/46/7/1'>7</a>."
NABRE,47,13,1,"[1] This third time I am coming: designation of the forthcoming visit as the ""third"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/12/14'>2CO 12:14</a>) may indicate that, in addition to his founding sojourn in Corinth, Paul had already made the first of two visits mentioned as planned in <a href='/NABRE/47/1/15'>2CO 1:15</a>, and the next visit will be the long-postponed second of these. If so, the materials in <a href='/NABRE/47/1/12'>2CO 1:12</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2:13</a> plus <a href='/NABRE/47/7/4'>2CO 7:4-16</a> and <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a> may date from the same period of time, presumably of some duration, between Pauls second and third visit, though it is not clear that they are addressing the same crisis. The chronology is too unsure and the relations between sections of 2 Corinthians too unclear to yield any certainty. The hypothesis that <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a> are themselves the ""tearful letter"" mentioned at <a href='/NABRE/47/2/3'>2CO 2:3-4</a> creates more problems than it solves."
NABRE,47,13,2,"[2] I warned those who sinned earlier: mention of unrepentant sinners (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/21'>2CO 12:21</a> and here) and of an oral admonition given them on an earlier visit complicates the picture at the very end of Pauls development. It provides, in fact, a second explanation for the show of power that has been threatened from the beginning (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-6</a>), but a different reason for it, quite unsuspected until now. It is not clear whether Paul is merely alluding to a dimension of the situation that he has not previously had occasion to mention, or whether some other community crisis, not directly connected with that behind <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a>, has influenced the final editing. I will not be lenient: contrast Pauls hesitation and reluctance to inflict pain in <a href='/NABRE/47/1/23'>2CO 1:23</a> and <a href='/NABRE/47/2/1'>2CO 2:1-4</a>. The next visit will bring the showdown."
NABRE,47,13,3,"[3] 13:3-4 Paul now gives another motive for severity when he comes, the charge of weakness leveled against him as an apostle. The motive echoes more closely the opening section (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-18</a>) and the intervening development (especially <a href='/NABRE/47/11/30'>2CO 11:30</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/12/10'>12:10</a>). Proof of Christ speaking in me: the threat of <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-2</a> is reworded to recall Pauls conformity with the pattern of Christ, his insertion into the interplay of death and life, weakness and power (cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/47/12/10'>2CO 12:10</a>b)."
NABRE,47,13,5,"[4] 13:5-9 Paul turns the challenge mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/47/13/3'>2CO 13:3</a> on them: they are to put themselves to the test to demonstrate whether Christ is in them. These verses involve a complicated series of plays on the theme of dokimē(testing, proof, passing and failing a test). Behind this stands the familiar distinction between present human judgment and final divine judgment. This is the final appearance of the theme (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/10/18'>2CO 10:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/11/15'>11:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/19'>12:19</a>)."
NABRE,47,13,10,"[5] Authority…to build up and not to tear down: Paul restates the purpose of his letter in language that echoes <a href='/NABRE/47/10/2'>2CO 10:2, 8</a>, emphasizing the positive purpose of his authority in their regard. This verse forms an inclusion with the topic sentence of the section (<a href='/NABRE/47/12/19'>2CO 12:19</a>), as well as with the opening of this entire portion of the letter (<a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10:1-2</a>)."
NABRE,47,13,11,"[6] 13:11-13 These verses may have originally concluded <a href='/NABRE/47/10/1'>2CO 10</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/13/1'>13</a>, but they have nothing specifically to do with the material of that section. It is also possible to consider them a conclusion to the whole of 2 Corinthians in its present edited form. The exhortations are general, including a final appeal for peace in the community. The letter ends calmly, after its many storms, with the prospect of ecclesial unity and divine blessing. The final verse is one of the clearest trinitarian passages in the New Testament."
NABRE,48,1,1,"[1] 1:1-5 See note on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1:1-7</a>, concerning the greeting."
NABRE,48,1,1,"[2] Apostle: because of attacks on his authority in Galatia, Paul defends his apostleship. He is not an apostle commissioned by a congregation (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/25'>PHL 2:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/8/23'>2CO 8:23</a>) or even by prophets (<a href='/NABRE/54/1/18'>1TM 1:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/4/14'>4:14</a>) but through Jesus Christ and God the Father."
NABRE,48,1,2,"[3] All the brothers: fellow believers in Christ, male and female; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/3/27'>GAL 3:27-28</a>. Paul usually mentions the co-sender(s) at the start of a letter, but the use of all is unique, adding weight to the letter. Galatia: central Turkey more likely than the Roman province of Galatia; see Introduction."
NABRE,48,1,4,[4] The greeting in v 3 is expanded by a christological formula that stresses deliverance through the Lord Jesus from a world dominated by Satan; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/4/4'>2CO 4:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/2/2'>EPH 2:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/6/12'>6:12</a>.
NABRE,48,1,6,"[5] 1:6-10 In place of the usual thanksgiving (see note on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/8'>ROM 1:8</a>), Paul, with little to be thankful for in the Galatian situation, expresses amazement at the way his converts are deserting the gospel of Christ for a perverted message. He reasserts the one gospel he has preached (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/7'>GAL 1:7-9</a>) and begins to defend himself (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/10'>GAL 1:10</a>)."
NABRE,48,1,6,"[6] The one who called you: God or Christ, though in actuality Paul was the divine instrument to call the Galatians."
NABRE,48,1,8,"[7] Accursed: in Greek, anathema; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/9/3'>ROM 9:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/12/3'>1CO 12:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/16/22'>16:22</a>."
NABRE,48,1,10,"[8] This charge by Pauls opponents, that he sought to conciliate people with flattery and to curry favor with God, might refer to his mission practices (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/9/19'>1CO 9:19-23</a>) but the word stillsuggests it refers to his pre-Christian days (cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/1/14'>GAL 1:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/3/6'>PHL 3:6</a>). The self-description slave of Christis one Paul often uses in a greeting (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1:1</a>)."
NABRE,48,1,11,"[9] 1:11-2:21 Pauls presentation on behalf of his message and of his apostleship reflects rhetorical forms of his day: he first narrates the facts about certain past events (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/12'>GAL 1:12</a>-<a href='/NABRE/48/2/14'>2:14</a>) and then states his contention regarding justification by faith as the gospel message (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/15'>GAL 2:15-21</a>). Further arguments follow from both experience and scripture in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/4/1'>4</a> before he draws out the ethical consequences (<a href='/NABRE/48/5/1'>GAL 5:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/48/6/10'>6:10</a>). The specific facts that he takes up here to show that his gospel is not a human invention (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/11'>GAL 1:11</a>) but came through a revelation of Jesus Christ(<a href='/NABRE/48/1/12'>GAL 1:12</a>) deal with his own calling as a Christian missionary (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/13'>GAL 1:13-17</a>), his initial relations with the apostles in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/18'>GAL 1:18-24</a>), a later journey to Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/1'>GAL 2:1-10</a>), and an incident in Antioch involving Cephas and persons from James (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/11'>GAL 2:11-14</a>). The content of Pauls revealed gospel is then set forth in the heart of the letter (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/15'>GAL 2:15-21</a>)."
NABRE,48,1,12,"[10] Although Paul received his gospel through a revelationfrom Christ, this did not exclude his use of early Christian confessional formulations. See note on <a href='/NABRE/48/1/4'>GAL 1:4</a>."
NABRE,48,1,13,"[11] 1:13-17 Along with <a href='/NABRE/50/3/4'>PHL 3:4-11</a>, which also moves from autobiography to its climax in a discussion on justification by faith (cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/2/15'>GAL 2:15-21</a>), this passage is Pauls chief account of the change from his former way of life(<a href='/NABRE/48/1/13'>GAL 1:13</a>) to service as a Christian missionary (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/16'>GAL 1:16</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/9/1'>ACT 9:1-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/4'>22:4-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/26/9'>26:9-18</a>. Paul himself does not use the term ""conversion"" but stresses revelation (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/12'>GAL 1:12, 16</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/48/1/15'>GAL 1:15</a> his language echoes the Old Testament prophetic call of Jeremiah. Unlike the account in Acts (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/22/4'>ACT 22:4-16</a>), the calling of Paul here includes the mission to proclaim Christ to the Gentiles(<a href='/NABRE/48/1/16'>GAL 1:16</a>)."
NABRE,48,1,16,[12] Flesh and blood: human authorities (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/17'>MAT 16:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/15/50'>1CO 15:50</a>). Pauls apostleship comes from God (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/1'>GAL 1:1</a>).
NABRE,48,1,17,"[13] Arabia: probably the region of the Nabataean Arabs, east and south of Damascus."
NABRE,48,1,18,"[14] 1:18-24 Pauls first journey to Jerusalem as a Christian, according to Galatians (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/9/23'>ACT 9:23-31</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/44/12/25'>ACT 12:25</a>). He is quite explicit about contacts there, testifying under oath (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/20'>GAL 1:20</a>). On returning to Syria(perhaps specifically Damascus, cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/1/17'>GAL 1:17</a>) and Cilicia(including his home town Tarsus, cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/9/30'>ACT 9:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/22/3'>22:3</a>), Paul most likely engaged in missionary work. He underscores the fact that Christians in Judea knew of him only by reputation."
NABRE,48,1,18,"[15] After three years: two years and more, since Pauls call. To confer withCephas may mean simply ""pay a visit"" or more specifically ""get information from"" him about Jesus, over a two-week period. Cephas: Aramaic name of Simon (Peter); cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/16/16'>MAT 16:16-18</a> and the notes there."
NABRE,48,1,19,"[16] James the brother of the Lord: not one of the Twelve, but a brother of Jesus (see note on <a href='/NABRE/41/6/3'>MAK 6:3</a>). He played an important role in the Jerusalem church (see note on <a href='/NABRE/48/2/9'>GAL 2:9</a>), the leadership of which he took over from Peter (<a href='/NABRE/44/12/17'>ACT 12:17</a>). Paul may have regarded James as an apostle."
NABRE,48,2,1,"[1] 2:1-10 Pauls second journey to Jerusalem, according to Galatians, involved a private meeting with those of repute(<a href='/NABRE/48/2/2'>GAL 2:2</a>). At issue was a Gentile, Titus, and the question of circumcision, which false brothers(<a href='/NABRE/48/2/4'>GAL 2:4</a>) evidently demanded for him. Paul insists that the gospel he preaches (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/2'>GAL 2:2</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/1/9'>GAL 1:9, 11</a>) remained intact with no addition by those of repute (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/6'>GAL 2:6</a>); that Tituswas not compelledto accept circumcision (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/3'>GAL 2:3</a>); and that he and the reputed pillarsin Jerusalem agreed on how each would advance the missionary task (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/7'>GAL 1:7-10</a>). Usually, <a href='/NABRE/48/1/1'>GAL 1:1-10</a> is equated with the ""Council of Jerusalem,"" as it is called, described in <a href='/NABRE/44/15/1'>ACT 15</a>. See notes on <a href='/NABRE/44/15/6'>ACT 15:6-12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/15/13'>13-35</a>, the latter concerning the ""decree"" that Paul does not mention."
NABRE,48,2,1,"[2] After fourteen years: thirteen or more years, probably reckoned from the return to Syria and Cilicia (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/21'>GAL 1:21</a>), though possibly from Pauls calling as a Christian (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/15'>GAL 1:15</a>). Barnabas: cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/2/9'>GAL 2:9, 13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/9/6'>1CO 9:6</a>. A Jewish Christian missionary, with whom Paul worked (<a href='/NABRE/44/4/36'>ACT 4:36-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/11/22'>11:22, 25</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/11/30'>30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/12/25'>12:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/1'>13:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/15/2'>15:2</a>). Titus: a missionary companion of Paul (<a href='/NABRE/47/2/13'>2CO 2:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/7/6'>7:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/7/13'>13-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/8/6'>8:6, 16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/47/8/23'>23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/12/18'>12:18</a>), non-Jewish (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/3'>GAL 2:3</a>), never mentioned in Acts."
NABRE,48,2,2,"[3] A revelation: cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/1/1'>GAL 1:1, 12</a>. Paul emphasizes it was Gods will, not Jerusalem authority, that led to the journey. <a href='/NABRE/44/15/2'>ACT 15:2</a> states that the church in Antioch appointed Paul and Barnabas for the task. Those of repute: leaders of the Jerusalem church; the term, while positive, may be slightly ironic (cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/1/6'>GAL 1:6, 9</a>). Run, in vain: while Paul presents a positive picture in what follows, his missionary work in Galatia would have been to no purpose if his opponents were correct that circumcision is needed for complete faith in Christ."
NABRE,48,2,3,"[4] Not evena Gentile Christian like Titus was compelled to receive the rite of circumcision. The Greek text could be interpreted that he voluntarily accepted circumcision, but this is unlikely in the overall argument."
NABRE,48,2,4,[5] False brothers: Jewish Christians who took the position that Gentile Christians must first become Jews through circumcision and observance of the Mosaic law in order to become Christians; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/15/1'>ACT 15:1</a>.
NABRE,48,2,5,"[6] The truth of the gospel: the true gospel, in contrast to the false one of the opponents (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/6'>GAL 1:6-9</a>); the gospel of grace, used as a norm (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/14'>GAL 2:14</a>)."
NABRE,48,2,7,"[7] 2:7-9 Some think that actual ""minutes"" of the meeting are here quoted. Pauls apostleship to the Gentiles (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/16'>GAL 1:16</a>) is recognized alongside that of Peter to the Jews. Moreover, the right to proclaim the gospel without requiring circumcision and the Jewish law is sealed by a handshake. That Paul and colleagues should go to the Gentilesdid not exclude his preaching to the Jews as well (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/13'>ROM 1:13-16</a>) or Cephas to Gentile areas."
NABRE,48,2,9,"[8] James and Cephas and John: see notes on <a href='/NABRE/48/1/18'>GAL 1:18, 19</a>; on Peter and John as leaders in the Jerusalem church, cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/3/1'>ACT 3:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/44/8/14'>ACT 8:14</a>. The order here, with James first, may reflect his prominence in Jerusalem after Peter (Cephas) departed (<a href='/NABRE/44/12/17'>ACT 12:17</a>)."
NABRE,48,2,10,[9] The poor: Jerusalem Christians or a group within the church there (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/15/26'>ROM 15:26</a>). The collection for them was extremely important in Pauls thought and labor (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/15/25'>ROM 15:25-28</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/16/1'>1CO 16:1-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/8/1'>2CO 8</a>-<a href='/NABRE/47/9/1'>9</a>).
NABRE,48,2,10,"[10] 2:11-14 The decision reached in Jerusalem (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/3'>GAL 2:3-7</a>) recognized the freedom of Gentile Christians from the Jewish law. But the problem of table fellowship between Jewish Christians, who possibly still kept kosher food regulations, and Gentile believers was not yet settled. When Cephas first came to the racially mixed community of Jewish and Gentile Christians in Antioch (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/12'>GAL 2:12</a>), he ate with non-Jews. Pressure from persons arriving later from Jerusalem caused him and Barnabas to draw back. Paul therefore publicly rebuked Peters inconsistency toward the gospel (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/14'>GAL 2:14</a>). Some think that what Paul said on that occasion extends through <a href='/NABRE/48/2/16'>GAL 2:16, 21</a>."
NABRE,48,2,11,"[11] Clearly was wrong: literally, ""stood condemned,"" by himself and also by Paul. His action in breaking table fellowship was especially grievous if the eating involved the meal at the Lords supper (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/11/17'>1CO 11:17-25</a>)."
NABRE,48,2,12,"[12] Some people came from James: strict Jewish Christians (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/15/1'>ACT 15:1, 5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/21/20'>21:20-21</a>), either sent by James (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/19'>GAL 1:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/2/9'>2:9</a>) or claiming to be from the leader of the Jerusalem church. The circumcised: presumably Jewish Christians, not Jews."
NABRE,48,2,13,"[13] The Jews: Jewish Christians, like Barnabas. Hypocrisy: literally, ""pretense,"" ""play-acting""; moral insincerity."
NABRE,48,2,14,"[14] Compel the Gentiles to live like Jews: that is, conform to Jewish practices, such as circumcision (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/3'>GAL 2:3-5</a>) or regulations about food (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/12'>GAL 2:12</a>)."
NABRE,48,2,14,"[15] 2:15-21 Following on the series of incidents cited above, Pauls argument, whether spoken to Cephas at Antioch or only now articulated, is pertinent to the Galatian situation, where believers were having themselves circumcised (<a href='/NABRE/48/6/12'>GAL 6:12-13</a>) and obeying other aspects of Jewish law (<a href='/NABRE/48/4/9'>GAL 4:9-10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/5/1'>5:1-4</a>). He insists that salvation is by faith in Christ, not by works of the law. His teaching on the gospel concerns justification by faith (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/16'>GAL 2:16</a>) in relation to sin (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/17'>GAL 2:17</a>), law (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/19'>GAL 2:19</a>), life in Christ (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/19'>GAL 2:19-20</a>), and grace (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/21'>GAL 2:21</a>)."
NABRE,48,2,16,[16] No one will be justified: <a href='/NABRE/19/143/2'>PS 143:2</a> is reflected.
NABRE,48,2,17,"[17] A minister of sin: literally, ""a servant of sin"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/15/8'>ROM 15:8</a>), an agent of sin, one who promotes it. This is possibly a claim by opponents that justification on the basis of faith in Christ makes Christ an abettor of sin when Christians are found to be sinners. Paul denies the conclusion (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>ROM 6:1-4</a>)."
NABRE,48,2,18,[18] To return to observance of the law as the means to salvation would entangle one not only in inevitable transgressions of it but also in the admission that it was wrong to have abandoned the law in the first place.
NABRE,48,2,19,"[19] Through the law I died to the law: this is variously explained: the law revealed sin (<a href='/NABRE/45/7/7'>ROM 7:7-9</a>) and led to death and then to belief in Christ; or, the law itself brought the insight that law cannot justify (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/16'>GAL 2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/19/143/2'>PS 143:2</a>); or, the ""law of Christ"" (<a href='/NABRE/48/6/2'>GAL 6:2</a>) led to abandoning the Mosaic law; or, the law put Christ to death (cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/3/13'>GAL 3:13</a>) and so provided a way to our salvation, through baptism into Christ, through which we die (crucified with Christ; see <a href='/NABRE/45/6/6'>ROM 6:6</a>). Cf. also <a href='/NABRE/48/3/19'>GAL 3:19-25</a> on the role of the law in reference to salvation."
NABRE,48,3,1,"[1] 3:1-14 Pauls contention that justification comes not through the law or the works of the law but by faith in Christ and in his death (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/16'>GAL 2:16, 21</a>) is supported by appeals to Christian experience (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3:1-5</a>) and to scripture (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/6'>GAL 3:6-14</a>). The gift of Gods Spirit to the Galatians came from the gospel received in faith, not from doing what the law enjoins. The story of Abraham shows that faith in God brings righteousness(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/6'>GAL 3:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/15/6'>GEN 15:6</a>). The promise to Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/8'>GAL 3:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/12/3'>GEN 12:3</a>) extends to the Gentiles (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/14'>GAL 3:14</a>)"
NABRE,48,3,1,"[2] Stupid: not just senseless, for they were in danger of deserting their salvation."
NABRE,48,3,2,"[3] Faith in what you heard: Pauls message received with faith. The Greek can also mean ""the proclamation of the faith"" or ""a hearing that comes from faith."""
NABRE,48,3,3,"[4] On the contrast of Spiritand flesh, cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/8/1'>ROM 8:1-11</a>. Having received the Spirit, they need not be circumcised now."
NABRE,48,3,4,[5] Experience so many things: probably the mighty deedsof <a href='/NABRE/48/1/5'>GAL 1:5</a> but possibly the experience of sufferings.
NABRE,48,3,6,[6] Abraham…righteousness: see <a href='/NABRE/1/15/6'>GEN 15:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/4/3'>ROM 4:3</a>. The Galatians like Abraham heard with faith and experienced justification. This first argument forms the basis for the further scriptural evidence that follows.
NABRE,48,3,7,"[7] 3:7-9 Faithis what matters, for Abrahamand the children of Abraham, in contrast to the claims of the opponents that circumcision and observance of the law are needed to bring the promised blessing of <a href='/NABRE/1/12/3'>GEN 12:3</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/18/18'>GEN 18:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/44/21'>SIR 44:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/3/25'>ACT 3:25</a>."
NABRE,48,3,10,"[8] 3:10-14 Those who dependnot on promise and faith but on works of the law are under a cursebecause they do not persevere in doing all the things written in the book of the law(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/10'>GAL 3:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/27/26'>DEU 27:26</a>) in order to gain life (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/12'>GAL 3:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/3/18/5'>LEV 18:5</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/10/5'>ROM 10:5</a>). But scripture teaches that no one is justified before God by the law(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/11'>GAL 3:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/2/4'>HEB 2:4</a>, adapted from the Greek version of Habakkuk; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/17'>ROM 1:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/10/38'>HEB 10:38</a>). Salvation, then, depends on faith in Christ who died on the cross (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/13'>GAL 3:13</a>), taking upon himself a curse found in <a href='/NABRE/5/21/23'>DEU 21:23</a> (about executed criminals hanged in public view), to free us from the curse of the law(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/13'>GAL 3:13</a>). That the Gentile Galatians have received the promised Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/14'>GAL 3:14</a>) by faith and in no other way returns the argument to the experience cited in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3:1-5</a>."
NABRE,48,3,15,"[9] 3:15-18 A third argument to support Pauls position that salvation is not through the law but by promise (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3:1-14</a>) comes from legal practice and scriptural history. A legal agreement or human will, duly ratified, is unalterable (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/15'>GAL 3:15</a>). Gods covenantwith Abrahamand its repeated promises (<a href='/NABRE/1/12/2'>GEN 12:2-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/1/12/7'>7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/13/15'>13:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/17/7'>17:7-8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/22/16'>22:16-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/24/7'>24:7</a>) is not superseded by the law, which came much later, in the time of Moses. The inheritance(of the Spirit and the blessings) is by promise, not by law (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/18'>GAL 3:18</a>). Pauls argument hinges on the fact that the same Greek word, diathēkē, can be rendered as willor testament (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/15'>GAL 3:15</a>) and as covenant(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/17'>GAL 3:17</a>)."
NABRE,48,3,16,"[10] Descendant: literally, ""and to his seed."" The Hebrew, as in <a href='/NABRE/1/12/7'>GEN 12:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/15/18'>15:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/22/17'>22:17-18</a>, is a collective singular, traditionally rendered as a plural, descendants, but taken by Paul in its literal number to refer to Christas descendant of Abraham."
NABRE,48,3,17,"[11] Four hundred and thirty years afterward: follows <a href='/NABRE/2/12/40'>EXO 12:40</a> in the Greek (Septuagint) version, in contrast to <a href='/NABRE/1/15/13'>GEN 15:13</a> and <a href='/NABRE/44/7/6'>ACT 7:6</a>, for chronology."
NABRE,48,3,18,[12] This refutes the opponents contention that the promises of God are fulfilled only as a reward for human observance of the law.
NABRE,48,3,19,"[13] 3:19-22 A digression: if the Mosaic law, then, does not save or bring life, why was it given? Elsewhere, Paul says the law served to show what sin is (<a href='/NABRE/45/3/20'>ROM 3:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/7/7'>7:7-8</a>). Here the further implication is that the law in effect served to produce transgressions. Moreover, it was received at second hand by angels, through a mediator, not directly from God (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/19'>GAL 3:19</a>). The law does not, however, oppose Gods purposes, for it carries out its function (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/22'>GAL 3:22</a>), so that righteousnesscomes by faithand promise, not by human works of the law."
NABRE,48,3,19,"[14] The descendant: Christ (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/16'>GAL 3:16</a>). By angels: <a href='/NABRE/5/33/2'>DEU 33:2-4</a> stressed their presence as enhancing the importance of the law; Paul uses their role to diminish its significance (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/7/38'>ACT 7:38, 53</a>). A mediator: Moses. But in a covenant of promise, where all depends on the one God, no mediator is needed (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/20'>GAL 3:20</a>)."
NABRE,48,3,22,"[15] 3:23-29 Paul adds a further argument in support of righteousness or justification by faith and through Gods promise rather than by works of the law (<a href='/NABRE/48/2/16'>GAL 2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/22'>3:22</a>): as children of God, baptized into Christ, the Galatians are all Abrahams descendantand heirsof the promiseto Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/8'>GAL 3:8, 14</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/3/16'>16-18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/3/29'>29</a>). The teaching in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/23'>GAL 3:23-25</a>, that since faith(Christianity) has come, we are no longer underthe law, could be taken with the previous paragraph on the role of the Mosaic law, but it also fits here as a contrast between the situation before faith(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/23'>GAL 3:23</a>) and the results after faith has come (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/25'>GAL 3:25-29</a>)."
NABRE,48,3,24,"[16] 3:24-25 Disciplinarian: the Greek paidagōgosreferred to a slave who escorted a child to school but did not teach or tutor; hence, a guardian or monitor. Applying this to the law fits the role of the law described in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/19'>GAL 3:19-25</a>."
NABRE,48,3,26,"[17] Children of God: literally ""sons,"" in contrast to the young child under the disciplinarian in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/24'>GAL 3:24-25</a>. The term includes males and females (<a href='/NABRE/48/3/28'>GAL 3:28</a>)."
NABRE,48,3,27,"[18] 3:27-28 Likely a formula used at baptism that expresses racial, social-economic, and sexual equality in Christ (cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/3/11'>COL 3:11</a>)."
NABRE,48,3,27,"[19] Clothed yourselves with Christ: literally, ""have put on Christ""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/13/14'>ROM 13:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/4/24'>EPH 4:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/3/10'>COL 3:10</a>. Baptismal imagery, traceable to the Old Testament (<a href='/NABRE/18/29/14'>JOB 29:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/59/17'>ISA 59:17</a>) but also found in pagan mystery cults."
NABRE,48,4,1,"[1] 4:1-7 What Paul has argued in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/26'>GAL 3:26-29</a> is now elaborated in terms of the Christian as the heir(<a href='/NABRE/48/4/1'>GAL 4:1, 7</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/3/18'>GAL 3:18, 29</a>) freed from control by others. Again, as in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/2'>GAL 3:2-5</a>, the proof that Christians are children of God is the gift of the Spirit of Christ relating them intimately to God."
NABRE,48,4,1,"[2] 4:1, 3 Not of age: an infant or minor."
NABRE,48,4,3,"[3] The elemental powers of the world: while the term can refer to the ""elements"" like earth, air, fire, and water or to elementary forms of religion, the sense here is more likely that of celestial beings that were thought in pagan circles to control the world; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/4/8'>GAL 4:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/51/2/8'>COL 2:8, 20</a>."
NABRE,48,4,6,"[4] Children: see note on <a href='/NABRE/48/3/26'>GAL 3:26</a>; here in contrast to the infant or young person not of age(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3:1, 3</a>). Abba: cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/36'>MAK 14:36</a> and the note; <a href='/NABRE/45/8/15'>ROM 8:15</a>."
NABRE,48,4,7,"[5] 4:8-11 On the basis of the arguments advanced from <a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3:1</a> through <a href='/NABRE/48/4/7'>GAL 4:7</a>, Paul now launches his appeal to the Galatians with the question, how can you turn backto the slavery of the law (<a href='/NABRE/48/4/9'>GAL 4:9</a>)? The question is posed with reference to bondage to the elemental powers(see note on <a href='/NABRE/48/4/3'>GAL 4:3</a>) because the Galatians had originally been converted to Christianity from paganism, not Judaism (<a href='/NABRE/48/4/8'>GAL 4:8</a>).

NABRE,48,4,11,[9] 4:12-20 A strongly personal section. Paul appeals to past ties between the Galatians and himself. He speaks sharply of the opponents (<a href='/NABRE/48/4/17'>GAL 4:17-18</a>) and pastorally to the Galatians (<a href='/NABRE/48/4/19'>GAL 4:19-20</a>).
NABRE,48,4,12,"[10] Because I have also become as you are: a terse phrase in Greek, meaning ""Be as I, Paul, am,"" i.e., living by faith, independent of the law, for, in spite of my background in Judaism (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/13'>GAL 1:13</a>), I have become as you Galatians are now, a brother in Christ."

It involves the relationship of Abraham(<a href='/NABRE/48/3/6'>GAL 3:6-16</a>) to his wife, Sarah, the freeborn woman, and to Hagar, the slave woman, and the contrast between the sons born to each, Isaac, child of promise, and Ishmael, son of Hagar (<a href='/NABRE/1/16/1'>GEN 16</a>; 21). Only through Isaac is the promise of God preserved. This allegory(<a href='/NABRE/48/4/24'>GAL 4:24</a>), with its equation of the Sinai covenant and Mosaic law with slavery and of the promise of God with freedom, Paul uses only in light of previous arguments. His quotation of <a href='/NABRE/1/21/10'>GEN 21:10</a> at <a href='/NABRE/48/4/30'>GAL 4:30</a> suggests on a scriptural basis that the Galatians should expel those who are troubling them (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/7'>GAL 1:7</a>)."

NABRE,49,2,14,"[7] 2:14-16 The elaborate imagery here combines pictures of Christ as our peace(<a href='/NABRE/23/9/5'>ISA 9:5</a>), his crucifixion, the ending of the Mosaic law (cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/2/14'>COL 2:14</a>), reconciliation (<a href='/NABRE/47/5/18'>2CO 5:18-21</a>), and the destruction of the dividing wallsuch as kept people from God in the temple or a barrier in the heavens."
NABRE,49,2,15,"[8] One new person: a corporate body, the Christian community, made up of Jews and Gentiles, replacing ancient divisions; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/16'>ROM 1:16</a>."
NABRE,49,2,20,[9] Capstone: the Greek can also mean cornerstone or keystone.
NABRE,49,3,1,"[1] 3:1-13 Paul reflects on his mission to the Gentiles. He alludes to his call and appointment to the apostolic office (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/2'>EPH 3:2-3</a>) and how his insightthrough revelation, as well as that of the other apostles and charismatic prophets in the church (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/4'>EPH 3:4-5</a>), has deepened understanding of Gods plan of salvation in Christ. Paul is the special herald (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/7'>EPH 3:7</a>) of a new promiseto the Gentiles(<a href='/NABRE/49/3/6'>EPH 3:6</a>): that the divine plan includes them in the spiritual benefits promised to Israel. Not only is this unique apostolic role his; Paul also has been given the task of explaining to all the divine planof salvation (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/8'>EPH 3:8-9</a>), once hidden. Through the church, Gods plan to save through Christ is becoming manifest to angelic beings (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/10'>EPH 3:10</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/1/21'>EPH 1:21</a>), in accord with Gods purpose(<a href='/NABRE/49/3/11'>EPH 3:11</a>). The fulfillment of the plan in Christ gives the whole church more confidencethrough faithin God (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/12'>EPH 3:12</a>). The readers of this letter are also thereby encouraged to greater confidence despite Pauls imprisonment (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/13'>EPH 3:13</a>)."
NABRE,49,3,1,"[2] A prisoner of Christ: see Introduction. Paul abruptly departs from his train of thought at the end of <a href='/NABRE/49/3/1'>EPH 3:1</a>, leaving an incomplete sentence."
NABRE,49,3,2,[3] Stewardship: the Greek is the same term employed at <a href='/NABRE/49/1/10'>EPH 1:10</a> for the planthat God administers (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/25'>COL 1:25</a>) and in which Paul plays a key role.
NABRE,49,3,3,[4] 3:3-4 The mystery: Gods resolve to deliver Gentiles along with Israel through Christ; cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/49/1/10'>EPH 1:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/3/9'>3:9</a>.
NABRE,49,3,9,"[5] [For all]: while some think this phrase was added so as to yield the sense ""to enlighten all about the plan…,"" it is more likely that some manuscripts and Fathers omitted it accidentally or to avoid the idea that allconflicted with Pauls assignment to preach to the Gentiles(<a href='/NABRE/49/3/8'>EPH 3:8</a>) specifically."
NABRE,49,3,10,[6] Principalities and authorities: see note on <a href='/NABRE/49/1/15'>EPH 1:15-23</a> regarding <a href='/NABRE/49/3/21'>EPH 3:21</a>.
NABRE,49,3,13,"[7] 3:14-21 The apostle prays that those he is addressing may, like the rest of the church, deepen their understanding of Gods plan of salvation in Christ. It is a plan that affects the whole universe (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/15'>EPH 3:15</a>) with the breadth and length and height and depthof Gods love in Christ (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/18'>EPH 3:18</a>) or possibly the universe in all its dimensions. The apostle prays that they may perceive the redemptive love of Christ for them and be completely immersed in the fullness of God (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/19'>EPH 3:19</a>). The prayer concludes with a doxology to God (<a href='/NABRE/49/3/20'>EPH 3:20-21</a>)."
NABRE,49,3,15,"[8] 3:14-15 Every family: in the Greek there is wordplay on the word for the Father(patria, patēr). The phrase could also mean ""Gods whole family"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/2/21'>EPH 2:21</a>)."
NABRE,49,4,1,"[1] 4:1-16 A general plea for unity in the church. Christians have been fashioned through the Spiritinto a single harmonious religious community (one body, <a href='/NABRE/49/4/4'>EPH 4:4, 12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/4/16'>EPH 4:16</a>), belonging to a single Lord(in contrast to the many gods of the pagan world), and by one way of salvation through faith, brought out especially by the significance of baptism(<a href='/NABRE/49/4/1'>EPH 4:1-6</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>ROM 6:1-11</a>). But Christian unity is more than adherence to a common belief. It is manifested in the exalted Christs gifts to individuals to serve so as to make the community more Christlike (<a href='/NABRE/49/4/11'>EPH 4:11-16</a>). This teaching on Christ as the source of the gifts is introduced in <a href='/NABRE/49/4/8'>EPH 4:8</a> by a citation of <a href='/NABRE/19/68/18'>PS 68:18</a>, which depicts Yahweh triumphantly leading Israel to salvation in Jerusalem. It is here understood of Christ, ascending above all the heavens, the headof the church; through his redemptive death, resurrection, and ascension he has become the source of the churchs spiritual gifts. The ""descent"" of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/49/4/9'>EPH 4:9-10</a>) refers more probably to the incarnation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-8</a>) than to Christs presence after his death in the world of the dead (cf. <a href='/NABRE/60/3/19'>1PE 3:19</a>)."
NABRE,49,4,4,"[2] 4:4-6 The ""seven unities"" (church, Spirit, hope; Lord, faithin Christ [<a href='/NABRE/49/1/13'>EPH 1:13</a>], baptism; one God) reflect the triune structure of later creeds in reverse."
NABRE,49,4,8,"[3] 4:8-10 While the emphasis is on an ascension and gift-giving by Christ, there is also a reference in taking prisoners captiveto the aeons and powers mentioned at <a href='/NABRE/49/1/21'>EPH 1:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/2/2'>2:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/3/10'>3:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/6/12'>6:12</a>."
NABRE,49,4,11,"[4] Concerning this list of ministers, cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/12/28'>1CO 12:28</a> and <a href='/NABRE/45/12/6'>ROM 12:6-8</a>. Evangelists: missionary preachers (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/21/8'>ACT 21:8</a>; <a href='/NABRE/55/4/5'>2TM 4:5</a>), not those who wrote gospels. Pastors and teachers: a single group in the Greek, shepherding congregations."
NABRE,49,4,12,[5] The ministerial leaders in <a href='/NABRE/49/4/11'>EPH 4:11</a> are to equip the whole people of God for their work of ministry.
NABRE,49,4,13,"[6] Mature manhood: literally, ""a perfect man"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/1/28'>COL 1:28</a>), possibly the ""one new person"" of <a href='/NABRE/49/2/15'>EPH 2:15</a>, though there anthrōpossuggests humanity, while here anēris the term for male. This personage becomes visible in the churchs growing to its fullness in the unity of those who believe in Christ."
NABRE,49,4,15,"[7] 4:15-16 The head, Christ: cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/1/18'>COL 1:18</a> and contrast <a href='/NABRE/46/12/12'>1CO 12:12-27</a> and <a href='/NABRE/45/12/4'>ROM 12:4-5</a> where Christ is identified with the whole body, including the head. The imagery may derive from ancient views in medicine, the headcoordinating and caring for the body, each ligament(perhaps the ministers of <a href='/NABRE/49/4/11'>EPH 4:11</a>) supporting the whole. But as at <a href='/NABRE/49/2/19'>EPH 2:19-22</a>, where the temple is depicted as a growing organism, there may also be the idea here of growing toward the capstone, Christ."
NABRE,49,4,16,"[8] 4:17-24 Paul begins to indicate how the new life in Christ contrasts with the Gentiles old way of existence. Literally, the old self(<a href='/NABRE/49/4/22'>EPH 4:22</a>) and the new self(<a href='/NABRE/49/4/24'>EPH 4:24</a>) are ""the old man"" and ""the new man"" (anthrōpos, person), as at <a href='/NABRE/49/2/15'>EPH 2:15</a>; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/49/4/13'>EPH 4:13</a>."

NABRE,49,5,14,"[3] An early Christian hymn, possibly from a baptismal liturgy. For the content compare <a href='/NABRE/49/2/5'>EPH 2:5-6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/3/9'>3:9</a> and <a href='/NABRE/23/60/1'>ISA 60:1</a>."
NABRE,49,5,15,"[4] 5:15-16, 19-20 The wording is similar to <a href='/NABRE/51/4/5'>COL 4:5</a> and <a href='/NABRE/49/3/16'>EPH 3:16-17</a>."
NABRE,49,5,21,"[5] 5:21-6:9 Cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/51/3/18'>COL 3:18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/51/4/1'>4:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/60/2/18'>1PE 2:18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/60/3/7'>3:7</a> for a similar listing of household duties where the inferior is admonished first (wives, <a href='/NABRE/49/5/22'>EPH 5:22</a>; children, <a href='/NABRE/49/6/1'>EPH 6:1</a>; slaves, <a href='/NABRE/49/6/5'>EPH 6:5</a>), then the superior (husbands, <a href='/NABRE/49/5/25'>EPH 5:25</a>; fathers, <a href='/NABRE/49/6/4'>EPH 6:4</a>; masters, <a href='/NABRE/49/6/9'>EPH 6:9</a>). Paul varies this pattern by an emphasis on mutuality (see <a href='/NABRE/49/5/20'>EPH 5:20</a>); use of Old Testament material about father and motherin <a href='/NABRE/49/6/2'>EPH 6:2</a>; the judgment to come for slave-owners (you have a Master in heaven, <a href='/NABRE/49/6/9'>EPH 6:9</a>); and above all the initial principle of subordination to one anotherunder Christ, thus effectively undermining exclusive claims to domination by one party. Into the section on wivesand husbandsan elaborate teaching on Christand the churchhas been woven (<a href='/NABRE/49/5/22'>EPH 5:22-33</a>)."
NABRE,49,5,21,"[6] 5:21-33 The apostle exhorts married Christians to a strong mutual love. Holding with <a href='/NABRE/1/2/24'>GEN 2:24</a> that marriage is a divine institution (<a href='/NABRE/49/5/31'>EPH 5:31</a>), Paul sees Christian marriage as taking on a new meaning symbolic of the intimate relationship of love between Christ and the church. The wife should serve her husband in the same spirit as that of the churchs service to Christ (<a href='/NABRE/49/5/22'>EPH 5:22, 24</a>), and the husband should care for his wife with the devotion of Christ to the church (<a href='/NABRE/49/5/25'>EPH 5:25-30</a>). Paul gives to the Genesis passage its highest meaning in the light of the union of Christ and the church, of which Christlike loyalty and devotion in Christian marriage are a clear reflection (<a href='/NABRE/49/5/31'>EPH 5:31-33</a>)."
NABRE,49,6,10,"[1] 6:10-20 A general exhortation to courage and prayer. Drawing upon the imagery and ideas of <a href='/NABRE/23/11/5'>ISA 11:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/59/16'>59:16-17</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/70/5/17'>WIS 5:17-23</a>, Paul describes the Christian in terms of the dress and equipment of Roman soldiers. He observes, however, that the Christians readiness for combat is not directed against human beings but against the spiritual powers of evil (<a href='/NABRE/49/6/10'>EPH 6:10-17</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/1/21'>EPH 1:21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/2/2'>2:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/3/10'>3:10</a>). Unique importance is placed upon prayer (<a href='/NABRE/49/6/18'>EPH 6:18-20</a>)."
NABRE,49,6,21,"[2] 6:21-24 Tychicus: the bearer of the letter; see note on <a href='/NABRE/51/4/7'>COL 4:7</a>. <a href='/NABRE/49/6/21'>EPH 6:21-22</a> parallel <a href='/NABRE/51/4/7'>COL 4:7-8</a>, often word for word. If Ephesians is addressed to several Christian communities (see Introduction), it is understandable that no greetings to individual members of these communities should have been included in it."
NABRE,50,1,1,"[1] 1:1-2 See note on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/1'>ROM 1:1-7</a>, concerning the greeting."
NABRE,50,1,1,"[2] Slaves: Paul usually refers to himself at the start of a letter as an apostle. Here he substitutes a term suggesting the unconditional obligation of himself and Timothy to the service of Christ, probably because, in view of the good relationship with the Philippians, he wishes to stress his status as a co-servant rather than emphasize his apostolic authority. Reference to Timothy is a courtesy: Paul alone writes the letter, as the singular verb throughout shows (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/3'>PHL 1:3-26</a>), and the reference (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/19'>PHL 2:19-24</a>) to Timothy in the third person. Overseers: the Greek term episkoposliterally means ""one who oversees"" or ""one who supervises,"" but since the second century it has come to designate the ""bishop,"" the official who heads a local church. In New Testament times this office had not yet developed into the form that it later assumed, though it seems to be well on the way to such development in the Pastorals; see <a href='/NABRE/54/3/2'>1TM 3:2</a> and <a href='/NABRE/56/1/7'>TIT 1:7</a>, where it is translated bishop. At Philippi, however (and at Ephesus, according to <a href='/NABRE/44/20/28'>ACT 20:28</a>), there was more than one episkopos, and the precise function of these officials is uncertain. In order to distinguish this office from the later stages into which it developed, the term is here translated as overseers. Ministers: the Greek term diakonoiis used frequently in the New Testament to designate ""servants,"" ""attendants,"" or ""ministers."" Paul refers to himself and to other apostles as ""ministers of God"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/6/4'>2CO 6:4</a>) or ""ministers of Christ"" (<a href='/NABRE/47/11/23'>2CO 11:23</a>). In the Pastorals (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/8'>1TM 3:8, 12</a>) the diakonoshas become an established official in the local church; hence the term is there translated as deacon. The diakonoiat Philippi seem to represent an earlier stage of development of the office; we are uncertain about their precise functions. Hence the term is here translated as ministers. See <a href='/NABRE/45/16/1'>ROM 16:1</a>, where Phoebe is described as a diakonos(minister) of the church of Cenchreae."
NABRE,50,1,2,"[3] The gifts come fromChrist the Lord, not simply through him from the Father; compare the christology in <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-11</a>."
NABRE,50,1,2,"[4] 1:3-11 As in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/8'>ROM 1:8-15</a> and all the Pauline letters except Galatians, a thanksgiving follows, including a direct prayer for the Philippians (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/9'>PHL 1:9-11</a>); see note on <a href='/NABRE/45/1/8'>ROM 1:8</a>. On their partnership for the gospel(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/5'>PHL 1:5</a>), cf. <a href='/NABRE/50/1/29'>PHL 1:29-30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/4/10'>4:10-20</a>. Their devotion to the faith and to Paul made them his pride and joy (<a href='/NABRE/50/4/1'>PHL 4:1</a>). The characteristics thus manifested are evidence of the communitys continuing preparation for the Lords parousia (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/6'>PHL 1:6, 10</a>). Pauls especially warm relationship with the Philippians is suggested here (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/7'>PHL 1:7-8</a>) as elsewhere in the letter. The eschatology serves to underscore a concern for ethical growth (<a href='/NABRE/49/1/9'>EPH 1:9-11</a>), which appears throughout the letter."
NABRE,50,1,6,"[5] The day of Christ Jesus: the parousia or triumphant return of Christ, when those loyal to him will be with him and share in his eternal glory; cf. <a href='/NABRE/50/1/10'>PHL 1:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/2/16'>2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/3/20'>3:20-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/4/17'>1TS 4:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/5/10'>5:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/53/1/10'>2TS 1:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/1/8'>1CO 1:8</a>."
NABRE,50,1,12,"[6] 1:12-26 The body of the letter begins with an account of Pauls present situation, i.e., his imprisonment(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/12'>PHL 1:12-13</a>; see Introduction), and then goes on with advice for the Philippians (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/27'>PHL 1:27</a>-<a href='/NABRE/50/2/18'>2:18</a>). The advanceof the gospel(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/12'>PHL 1:12</a>) and the progressof the Philippians in the faith(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/25'>PHL 1:25</a>) frame what is said."
NABRE,50,1,13,[7] Praetorium: either the praetorian guard in the city where Paul was imprisoned or the governors official residence in a Roman province (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/15/16'>MAK 15:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/23/35'>ACT 23:35</a>). See Introduction on possible sites.
NABRE,50,1,14,"[8] 1:14-18 Although Paul is imprisoned, Christians there nonetheless go on preaching Christ. But they do so with varied motives, somewith personal hostility toward Paul, others out of personal ambition."
NABRE,50,1,18,[9] Rejoice: a major theme in the letter; see Introduction.
NABRE,50,1,19,"[10] 1:19-25 Paul earnestly debates his prospects of martyrdom or continued missionary labor. While he may long to depart this lifeand thus be with Christ(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/23'>PHL 1:23</a>), his overall and final expectation is that he will be delivered from this imprisonment and continue in the serviceof the Philippians and of others (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/19'>PHL 1:19, 25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/2/24'>PHL 2:24</a>). In either case, Christ is central (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/20'>PHL 1:20-21</a>); if to live means Christ for Paul, death means to be united with Christ in a deeper sense."
NABRE,50,1,19,"[11] Result in deliverance for me: an echo of <a href='/NABRE/18/13/16'>JOB 13:16</a>, hoping that God will turn suffering to ultimate good and deliverance from evil."
NABRE,50,1,27,"[12] 1:27-30 Ethical admonition begins at this early point in the letter, emphasizing steadfastness and congregational unity in the face of possible suffering. The opponents(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/28'>PHL 1:28</a>) are those in Philippi, probably pagans, who oppose the gospel cause. This is proof…(<a href='/NABRE/50/1/28'>PHL 1:28</a>) may refer to the whole outlook and conduct of the Philippians, turning out for their salvation but to the judgment of the opponents (cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/2/15'>2CO 2:15-16</a>), or possibly the sentence refers to the opinion of the opponents, who hold that the obstinacy of the Christians points to the destruction of such people as defy Roman authority (though in reality, Paul holds, such faithfulness leads to salvation)."
NABRE,50,1,30,[13] A reference to Pauls earlier imprisonment in Philippi (<a href='/NABRE/44/16/19'>ACT 16:19-24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/2/2'>1TS 2:2</a>) and to his present confinement.
NABRE,50,2,1,"[1] 2:1-11 The admonition to likemindedness and unity (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/2'>PHL 2:2-5</a>) is based on the believers threefold experience with Christ, Gods love, and the Spirit. The appeal to humility (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/3'>PHL 2:3</a>) and to obedience (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/12'>PHL 2:12</a>) is rooted in christology, specifically in a statement about Christ Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-11</a>) and his humbling of self and obedience to the point of death (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/8'>PHL 2:8</a>)."
NABRE,50,2,5,"[2] Have…the same attitude that is also yours in Christ Jesus: or, ""that also Christ Jesus had."" While it is often held that Christ here functions as a model for moral imitation, it is not the historical Jesus but the entire Christ event that <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-11</a> depict. Therefore, the appeal is to have in relations among yourselves that same relationship you have in Jesus Christ, i.e., serving one another as you serve Christ (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/4'>PHL 2:4</a>)."
NABRE,50,2,6,"[3] 2:6-11 Perhaps an early Christian hymn quoted here by Paul. The short rhythmic lines fall into two parts, <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-8</a> where the subject of every verb is Christ, and <a href='/NABRE/50/2/9'>PHL 2:9-11</a> where the subject is God. The general pattern is thus of Christs humiliation and then exaltation. More precise analyses propose a division into six three-line stanzas (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6</a>; 7abc, 7d-8, 9, 10, 11) or into three stanzas (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-7</a>ab, 7cd-8, 9-11). Phrases such as even death on a cross(<a href='/NABRE/50/2/8'>PHL 2:8</a>c) are considered by some to be additions (by Paul) to the hymn, as are <a href='/NABRE/50/2/10'>PHL 2:10</a>c, 11c."
NABRE,50,2,6,"[4] Either a reference to Christs preexistence and those aspects of divinity that he was willing to give up in order to serve in human form, or to what the man Jesus refused to grasp at to attain divinity. Many see an allusion to the Genesis story: unlike Adam, Jesus, though…in the form of God(<a href='/NABRE/1/1/26'>GEN 1:26-27</a>), did not reach out for equality with God, in contrast with the first Adam in <a href='/NABRE/1/3/5'>GEN 3:5-6</a>."

While it is common to take <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6, 7</a> as dealing with Christs preexistence and <a href='/NABRE/50/2/8'>PHL 2:8</a> with his incarnate life, so that lines <a href='/NABRE/50/2/7'>PHL 2:7</a>b, 7c are parallel, it is also possible to interpret so as to exclude any reference to preexistence (see note on <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6</a>) and to take <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-8</a> as presenting two parallel stanzas about Jesus human state (<a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-7</a>b; 7cd-8); in the latter alternative, coming in human likenessbegins the second stanza and parallels 6a to some extent."

While the verb could also be translated ""good-bye"" or ""farewell,"" although it is never so used in Greek epistolography, the theme of joy has been frequent in the letter (<a href='/NABRE/50/1/18'>PHL 1:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/2/2'>2:2, 18</a>); note also <a href='/NABRE/50/4/4'>PHL 4:4</a> and the addition of ""always"" there as evidence for the meaning ""rejoice.""

NABRE,50,3,2,"[2] 3:2-21 An abrupt change in content and tone, either because Paul at this point responds to disturbing news he has just heard about a threat to the faith of the Philippians in the form of false teachers, or because part of another Pauline letter was inserted here; see Introduction. The chapter describes these teachers in strong terms as dogs. The persons meant are evidently different from the rival preachers of <a href='/NABRE/50/1/14'>PHL 1:14-18</a> and the opponents of <a href='/NABRE/50/1/28'>PHL 1:28</a>. Since <a href='/NABRE/50/3/2'>PHL 3:2-4</a> emphasize Jewish terms like circumcision(<a href='/NABRE/50/3/2'>PHL 3:2-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/50/3/5'>5</a>), some relate them to the ""Judaizers"" of the Letter to the Galatians. Other phrases make them appear more like the false teachers of <a href='/NABRE/47/11/12'>2CO 11:12-15</a>, the evil-workers. The latter part of the chapter depicts the manywho are enemiesof Christs cross in terms that may sound more Gentile or even ""gnostic"" than Jewish (<a href='/NABRE/50/3/18'>PHL 3:18-19</a>). Accordingly, some see two groups of false teachers in <a href='/NABRE/50/3/1'>PHL 3</a>, others one group characterized by a claim of having attained ""perfect maturity"" (<a href='/NABRE/50/3/12'>PHL 3:12-15</a>)."
NABRE,50,3,2,"[3] 3:2-11 Paul sets forth the Christian claim, especially using personal, autobiographical terms that are appropriate to the situation. He presents his own experience in coming to know Christ Jesus in terms of righteousnessor justification (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/16'>ROM 1:16-17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/3/21'>3:21</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/5/11'>5:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/2/5'>GAL 2:5-11</a>), contrasting the righteousness from Godthrough faith and that of ones own based on the lawas two exclusive ways of pleasing God."
NABRE,50,3,2,"[4] Beware of the mutilation: literally, ""incision,"" an ironic wordplay on ""circumcision""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/5/12'>GAL 5:12</a>. There may be an association with the self-inflicted mutilations of the prophets of Baal (<a href='/NABRE/11/18/28'>1KG 18:28</a>) and of devotees of Cybele who slashed themselves in religious frenzy."

NABRE,50,3,7,[7] Loss: his knowledge of Christ led Paul to reassess the ways of truly pleasing and serving God.

NABRE,51,1,15,"[6] 1:15-20 As the poetic arrangement indicates, these lines are probably an early Christian hymn, known to the Colossians and taken up into the letter from liturgical use (cf. <a href='/NABRE/50/2/6'>PHL 2:6-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/3/16'>1TM 3:16</a>). They present Christ as the mediator of creation (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/15'>COL 1:15-18</a>a) and of redemption (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/18'>COL 1:18</a>b-20). There is a parallelism between firstborn of all creation(<a href='/NABRE/51/1/15'>COL 1:15</a>) and firstborn from the dead(<a href='/NABRE/51/1/18'>COL 1:18</a>). While many of the phrases were at home in Greek philosophical use and even in gnosticism, the basic ideas also reflect Old Testament themes about Wisdom found in <a href='/NABRE/20/8/22'>PRO 8:22-31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/7/22'>WIS 7:22</a>-<a href='/NABRE/70/8/1'>8:1</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/71/1/4'>SIR 1:4</a>.

NABRE,51,1,15,"[7] Image: cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/1/27'>GEN 1:27</a>. Whereas the man and the woman were originally created in the image and likeness of God (see also <a href='/NABRE/1/1/26'>GEN 1:26</a>), Christ as image (<a href='/NABRE/47/4/4'>2CO 4:4</a>) of the invisible God(<a href='/NABRE/43/1/18'>JHN 1:18</a>) now shares this new nature in baptism with those redeemed (cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/3/10'>COL 3:10-11</a>)."
NABRE,51,1,16,"[8] 1:16-17 Christ (though not mentioned by name) is preeminent and supreme as Gods agent in the creation of all things(cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/3'>JHN 1:3</a>), as prior to all things(<a href='/NABRE/51/1/17'>COL 1:17</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/1/3'>HEB 1:3</a>)."
NABRE,51,1,18,"[9] Church: such a reference seemingly belongs under ""redemption"" in the following lines, not under the ""creation"" section of the hymn. Stoic thought sometimes referred to the world as ""the body of Zeus."" Pauline usage is to speak of the church as the body of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/46/12/12'>1CO 12:12-27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/12/4'>ROM 12:4-5</a>). Some think that the author of Colossians has inserted the reference to the church here so as to define ""head of the body"" in Pauls customary way. See <a href='/NABRE/51/1/24'>COL 1:24</a>. Preeminent: when Christ was raised by God as firstborn from the dead(cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/26/23'>ACT 26:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/1/5'>REV 1:5</a>), he was placed over the community, the church, that he had brought into being, but he is also indicated as crown of the whole new creation, over all things. His further role is to reconcile all things(<a href='/NABRE/51/1/20'>COL 1:20</a>) for God or possibly ""to himself."""
NABRE,51,1,19,"[10] Fullness: in gnostic usage this term referred to a spiritual world of beings above, between God and the world; many later interpreters take it to refer to the fullness of the deity(<a href='/NABRE/51/2/9'>COL 2:9</a>); the reference could also be to the fullness of grace (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/16'>JHN 1:16</a>)."
NABRE,51,1,20,"[11] The blood of his cross: the most specific reference in the hymn to redemption through Christs death, a central theme in Paul; cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/2/14'>COL 2:14-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/1/17'>1CO 1:17, 18</a>, <a href='/NABRE/46/1/23'>23</a>. [Through him]: the phrase, lacking in some manuscripts, seems superfluous but parallels the reference to reconciliation through Christ earlier in the verse."
NABRE,51,1,21,"[12] 1:21-23 Paul, in applying this hymn to the Colossians, reminds them that they have experienced the reconciling effect of Christs death. He sees the effects of the cross in the redemption of human beings, not of cosmic powers such as those referred to in <a href='/NABRE/51/1/16'>COL 1:16, 20</a> (all things). Paul also urges adherence to Christ in faith and begins to point to his own role as minister (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/23'>COL 1:23</a>), sufferer (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/24'>COL 1:24</a>), and proclaimer (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/27'>COL 1:27-28</a>) of this gospel."
NABRE,51,1,23,"[13] 1:24-2:3 As the community at Colossae was not personally known to Paul (see Introduction), he here invests his teaching with greater authority by presenting a brief sketch of his apostolic ministry and sufferings as they reflect those of Christ on behalf of the church (24). The preaching of Gods word (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/25'>COL 1:25</a>) carries out the divine plan (the mystery, <a href='/NABRE/51/1/26'>COL 1:26</a>) to make Christ known to the Gentiles (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/27'>COL 1:27</a>). It teaches the God-given wisdom about Christ (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/28'>COL 1:28</a>), whose power works mightily in the apostle (<a href='/NABRE/51/1/29'>COL 1:29</a>). Even in those communities that do not know him personally (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/1'>COL 2:1</a>), he can increase the perception of God in Christ, unite the faithful more firmly in love, and so bring encouragement to them (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/2'>COL 2:2</a>). He hopes that his apostolic authority will make the Colossians perceive more readily the defects in the teaching of others who have sought to delude them, the next concern in the letter."
NABRE,51,1,24,"[14] What is lacking: although variously interpreted, this phrase does not imply that Christs atoning death on the cross was defective. It may refer to the apocalyptic concept of a quota of ""messianic woes"" to be endured before the end comes; cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/13/8'>MAK 13:8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/13/19'>19-20</a>, <a href='/NABRE/41/13/24'>24</a> and the note on <a href='/NABRE/40/23/29'>MAT 23:29-32</a>.

They do not require circumcision(<a href='/NABRE/51/2/11'>COL 2:11</a>), for in baptismtheir whole being has been affected by Christ (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/12'>COL 2:12</a>) through forgiveness of sin and resurrection to a new life (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/13'>COL 2:13</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/3/1'>COL 3:1</a> and <a href='/NABRE/45/6/1'>ROM 6:1-11</a>). On the cross Christ canceled the record of the debt that stood against us with all its claims (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/14'>COL 2:14</a>), i.e., he eliminated the law (cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/2/15'>EPH 2:15</a>) that human beings could not observe—and that could not save them. He forgave sins against the law (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/14'>COL 2:14</a>) and exposed as false and misleading (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/15'>COL 2:15</a>) all other powers (cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/1/16'>COL 1:16</a>) that purport to offer salvation. Therefore, the Colossians are not to accept judgments from such teachers on food and drinkor to keep certain religious festivals or engage in certain cultic practices (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/16'>COL 2:16</a>), for the Colossians would thereby risk severing themselves from Christ (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/19'>COL 2:19</a>). If, when they accepted the gospel, they believed in Christ as their savior, they must be convinced that their salvation cannot be achieved by appeasing ruling spirits through dietary practices or through a wisdom gained simply by means of harsh asceticism (<a href='/NABRE/51/2/20'>COL 2:20-23</a>)."

NABRE,52,2,4,"[1] Judged worthy: Paul regards ""worthiness"" not as grounded in ones own talent or moral self-righteousness but in Gods discernment of genuinely selfless attitudes and actions (see <a href='/NABRE/47/10/17'>2CO 10:17-18</a>)."
NABRE,52,2,7,"[2] Gentle: many excellent manuscripts read ""infants"" (nēpioi), but ""gentle"" (ēpioi) better suits the context here."
NABRE,52,2,14,[3] Lukes picture of the persecutions at Philippi (by Gentiles) and in Thessalonica and Beroea (by Jews) seems to be considerably schematized (<a href='/NABRE/44/16/11'>ACT 16:11-40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/17/1'>17:1-15</a>). Paul pictures the Thessalonian community as composed of converts from paganism (<a href='/NABRE/52/1/9'>1TS 1:9</a>) and speaks here of persecution by their (pagan) compatriots rather than by Jews.
NABRE,52,2,15,"[4] 2:15-16 Paul is speaking of historical opposition on the part of Palestinian Jews in particular and does so only some twenty years after Jesus crucifixion. Even so, he quickly proceeds to depict the persecutors typologically, in apocalyptic terms. His remarks give no grounds for anti-Semitism to those willing to understand him, especially in view of Pauls pride in his own ethnic and religious background (<a href='/NABRE/45/9/1'>ROM 9:1-5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/10/1'>10:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/11/1'>11:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/50/3/4'>PHL 3:4-6</a>). Sinful conduct (<a href='/NABRE/52/2/16'>1TS 2:16</a>) is itself an anticipation of the ultimate wrath or judgment of God (<a href='/NABRE/45/1/18'>ROM 1:18</a>-<a href='/NABRE/45/2/5'>2:5</a>), whether or not it is perceived as such."
NABRE,52,3,3,[1] We are destined: the Greek phraseology and the context suggest Pauls concern to alert his readers to difficulties he knew they would necessarily face and to enable them to see their present experience in the light of what he warned them would happen in the future. This line of thought is followed in <a href='/NABRE/53/2/1'>2TS 2:1-15</a>.
NABRE,52,3,9,"[2] 3:9-10 The tension between Pauls optimism concerning the Thessalonians faith and his worries about their perseverance remains unresolved. Perhaps this is accounted for not only by the continuing harassment but also by the shortness of his own stay in Thessalonica (even if that were over twice as long as the conventional three weeks that Luke assigns to it, <a href='/NABRE/44/17/2'>ACT 17:2</a>)."
NABRE,52,4,2,"[1] Instructions: these include specific guidelines on the basis of the Lords authority, not necessarily sayings Jesus actually uttered. More profoundly, as <a href='/NABRE/52/4/8'>1TS 4:8</a> implies, the instructions are practical principles that Paul worked out in accordance with his understanding of the role of the Spirit."
NABRE,52,4,2,"[2] 4:3-8 Many think that this passage deals with a variety of moral regulations (fornication, adultery, sharp business practices). It can be more specifically interpreted as bringing general norms to bear on a specific problem, namely, marriage within degrees of consanguinity (as between uncle and niece) forbidden in Jewish law but allowed according to a Greek heiress law, which would insure retention of an inheritance within the family and perhaps thereby occasion divorce. In that case, ""immorality"" (<a href='/NABRE/52/4/3'>1TS 4:3</a>) should be rendered as ""unlawful marriage"" and ""this matter"" (<a href='/NABRE/52/4/6'>1TS 4:6</a>) as ""a lawsuit."" The phrase in <a href='/NABRE/52/4/4'>1TS 4:4</a>, ""acquire a wife for himself,"" has often been interpreted to mean ""control ones body."""
NABRE,52,4,15,"[3] Coming of the Lord: Paul here assumes that the second coming, or parousia, will occur within his own lifetime but insists that the time or season is unknown (<a href='/NABRE/52/5/1'>1TS 5:1-2</a>). Nevertheless, the most important aspect of the parousia for him was the fulfillment of union with Christ. His pastoral exhortation focuses first on hope for the departed faithful, then (<a href='/NABRE/52/5/1'>1TS 5:1-3</a>) on the need of preparedness for those who have to achieve their goal."
NABRE,52,4,17,"[4] Will be caught up together: literally, snatched up, carried off; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/12/2'>2CO 12:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/12/5'>REV 12:5</a>. From the Latin verb here used, rapiemur, has come the idea of ""the rapture,"" when believers will be transported away from the woes of the world; this construction combines this verse with <a href='/NABRE/40/24/40'>MAT 24:40-41</a> (see note there) || <a href='/NABRE/42/17/34'>LUK 17:34-35</a> and passages from Revelation in a scheme of millennial dispensationalism."
NABRE,52,5,5,"[1] Children of the light: that is, belonging to the daylight of Gods personal revelation and expected to achieve it (an analogous development of imagery that appears in <a href='/NABRE/43/12/36'>JHN 12:36</a>)."
NABRE,52,5,10,"[2] Characteristically, Paul plays on words suggesting ultimate and anticipated death and life. Union with the crucified and risen Lord at his parousia is anticipated in some measure in contrasted states of our temporal life. The essential element he urges is our indestructible personal union in Christs own life (see <a href='/NABRE/45/5/1'>ROM 5:1-10</a>)."
NABRE,52,5,19,[3] 5:19-21 Pauls buoyant encouragement of charismatic freedom sometimes occasioned excesses that he or others had to remedy (see <a href='/NABRE/46/14/1'>1CO 14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/53/2/1'>2TS 2:1-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/61/3/1'>2PE 3:1-16</a>).
NABRE,52,5,23,"[4] Another possible translation is, ""May the God of peace himself make you perfectly holy and sanctify your spirit fully, and may both soul and body be preserved blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ."" In either case, Paul is not offering an anthropological or philosophical analysis of human nature. Rather, he looks to the wholeness of what may be called the supernatural and natural aspects of a persons service of God."
NABRE,52,5,26,"[5] Kiss: the holy embrace (see <a href='/NABRE/45/16/16'>ROM 16:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/16/20'>1CO 16:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/13/12'>2CO 13:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/60/5/14'>1PE 5:14</a>) was a greeting of respect and affection, perhaps given during a liturgy at which Pauls letter would have been read."

Pauls gratitude to God for the faith and love of the Thessalonians (<a href='/NABRE/53/1/3'>2TS 1:3</a>) and his Christian pride in their faithful endurance (<a href='/NABRE/53/1/4'>2TS 1:4-5</a>) contrast with the condemnation announced for those who afflict them, a judgment to be carried out at the parousia (<a href='/NABRE/53/1/6'>2TS 1:6-10</a>), which is described in vivid language drawn from Old Testament apocalyptic. A prayer for the fulfillment of Gods purpose in the Thessalonians (<a href='/NABRE/53/1/11'>2TS 1:11-12</a>) completes the section, as is customary in a Pauline letter (cf. <a href='/NABRE/52/1/2'>1TS 1:2-3</a>)."
NABRE,53,1,10,"[3] Among his holy ones: in the Old Testament, this term can refer to an angelic throng (cf. also <a href='/NABRE/65/1/14'>JUD 1:14</a>), but here, in parallel with among all who have believed, it can refer to the triumphant people of God."
NABRE,53,1,12,"[4] The grace of our God and Lord Jesus Christ: the Greek can also be translated, ""the grace of our God and of the Lord Jesus Christ."""
NABRE,53,2,1,"[1] 2:1-17 The Thessalonians have been shakenby a message purporting to come from Paul himself that the day of the Lordis already present. He warns against this deception in eschatology by citing a scenario of events that must first occur (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/3'>2TS 2:3-12</a>) before the end will come. The overall point Paul makes is the need to reject such lies as Satan sends; he also reaffirms the Thessalonians in their calling (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/13'>2TS 2:13-14</a>). They are to uphold what Paul himself has taught (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/15'>2TS 2:15</a>). There is a concluding prayer for their strengthening (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/16'>2TS 2:16-17</a>). As in <a href='/NABRE/53/1/8'>2TS 1:8-10</a>, the Old Testament provides a good deal of coloring; cf. especially <a href='/NABRE/23/14/13'>ISA 14:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/66/15'>66:15</a>, <a href='/NABRE/23/66/18'>18-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/26/28/2'>EZE 28:2-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/11/36'>DAN 11:36-37</a>. The contents of <a href='/NABRE/53/2/3'>2TS 2:3</a>b-8 may come from a previously existing apocalypse. The details have been variously interpreted. An alternative to the possibilities noted below understands that an oracular utterance, supposedly coming from a prophetic spirit (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/2'>2TS 2:2-3</a>a), has so disrupted the communitys thinking that its effects may be compared to those of the mania connected with the worship of the Greek god Dionysus. On this view, the writer seems to allude in <a href='/NABRE/53/2/6'>2TS 2:6-8</a> to Dionysiac ""seizure,"" although, of course, ironically, somewhat as Paul alludes to witchcraft (""an evil eye"") in <a href='/NABRE/48/3/1'>GAL 3:1</a> in speaking of the threat to faith posed by those disturbing the Galatians (<a href='/NABRE/48/1/6'>GAL 1:6-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/5/10'>5:10</a>b). On this view of <a href='/NABRE/53/2/1'>2TS 2</a>, the Greek participles katechon(rendered above as what is restraining) and katechōn(the one who restrains) are to be translated ""the seizing power"" in <a href='/NABRE/53/2/6'>2TS 2:6</a> and ""the seizer"" in <a href='/NABRE/53/2/7'>2TS 2:7</a>. They then allude to a pseudocharismatic force or spirit of Dionysiac character that has suddenly taken hold of the Thessalonian community (see <a href='/NABRE/53/2/2'>2TS 2:2</a>). The addressees know(<a href='/NABRE/53/2/6'>2TS 2:6</a>) this force or spirit because of the problem it is causing. This pseudocharismatic force or spirit is a kind of anticipation and advance proof of the ultimate, climactic figure (the lawless oneor the rebel, <a href='/NABRE/53/2/3'>2TS 2:3</a>), of which the community has been warned (see note on <a href='/NABRE/52/3/3'>1TS 3:3</a>). It is, however, only the beginning of the end that the latters manifestation entails; the end is not yet. For in the course of the mystery of lawlessness(<a href='/NABRE/53/2/7'>2TS 2:7</a>), false prophetism, after it ceases in the Thessalonian community, will be manifested in the world at large (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/8'>2TS 2:8-12</a>), where it will also be eliminated in turn by the Lord Jesus."
NABRE,53,2,2,"[2] ""Spirit"": a Spirit-inspired utterance or ecstatic revelation. An oral statement: literally, a ""word"" or pronouncement, not necessarily of ecstatic origin. A letter allegedly sent by us: possibly a forged letter, so that Paul calls attention in <a href='/NABRE/53/3/17'>2TS 3:17</a> to his practice of concluding a genuine letter with a summary note or greeting in his own hand, as at <a href='/NABRE/48/6/11'>GAL 6:11-18</a> and elsewhere."
NABRE,53,2,3,"[3] 2:3b-5 This incomplete sentence (anacoluthon, <a href='/NABRE/53/2/4'>2TS 2:4</a>) recalls what the Thessalonians had already been taught, an apocalyptic scenario depicting, in terms borrowed especially from <a href='/NABRE/27/11/36'>DAN 11:36-37</a> and related verses, human self-assertiveness against God in the temple of Goditself. The lawless onerepresents the climax of such activity in this account."
NABRE,53,2,4,"[4] Seat himself in the temple of God: a reflection of the language in <a href='/NABRE/27/7/23'>DAN 7:23-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/8/9'>8:9-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/9/27'>9:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/11/36'>11:36-37</a>; <a href='/NABRE/27/12/11'>12:11</a> about the attempt of Antiochus IV Epiphanes to set up a statue of Zeus in the Jerusalem temple and possibly of the Roman emperor Caligula to do a similar thing (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/14'>MAK 13:14</a>). Here the imagery suggests an attempt to install someone in the place of God, claiming that he is a god(cf. <a href='/NABRE/26/28/2'>EZE 28:2</a>). Usually, it is the Jerusalem temple that is assumed to be meant; on the alternative view sketched above (see note on <a href='/NABRE/53/2/1'>2TS 2:1-17</a>), the templerefers to the Christian community."
NABRE,53,2,6,"[5] 2:6-7 What is restraining…the one who restrains: neuter and masculine, respectively, of a force and person holding back the lawless one. The Thessalonians know what is meant (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/6'>2TS 2:6</a>), but the terms, seemingly found only in this passage and in writings dependent on it, have been variously interpreted. Traditionally, <a href='/NABRE/53/2/6'>2TS 2:6</a> has been applied to the Roman empire and <a href='/NABRE/53/2/7'>2TS 2:7</a> to the Roman emperor (in Pauls day, Nero) as bulwarks holding back chaos (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/13/1'>ROM 13:1-7</a>). A second interpretation suggests that cosmic or angelic powers are binding Satan (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/9'>2TS 2:9</a>) and so restraining him; some relate this to an anti-Christ figure (<a href='/NABRE/62/2/18'>1JN 2:18</a>) or to Michael the archangel (<a href='/NABRE/66/12/7'>REV 12:7-9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/20/1'>20:1-3</a>). A more recent view suggests that it is the preaching of the Christian gospel that restrains the end, for in Gods plan the end cannot come until the gospel is preached to all nations (<a href='/NABRE/41/13/10'>MAK 13:10</a>); in that case, Paul as missionary preacher par excellence is ""the one who restrains,"" whose removal (death) will bring the end (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/7'>2TS 2:7</a>). On the alternative view (see note on <a href='/NABRE/53/2/1'>2TS 2:1-17</a>), the phrases should be referred to that which and to him who seizes (a prophet) in ecstasy so as to have him speak pseudo-oracles."
NABRE,53,2,7,"[6] 2:7-12 The lawless oneand the one who restrainsare involved in an activity or process, the mystery of lawlessness, behind which Satanstands (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/9'>2TS 2:9</a>). The action of the Lord [Jesus]in overcoming the lawless one is described in Old Testament language (with the breath of his mouth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/4'>ISA 11:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/4/9'>JOB 4:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/19/15'>REV 19:15</a>). His comingis literally the Lords ""parousia."" The biblical concept of the ""holy war,"" eschatologically conceived, may underlie the imagery."
NABRE,53,2,13,"[7] As the firstfruits: there is also strong manuscript evidence for the reading, ""God chose you from the beginning,"" thus providing a focus on Gods activity from beginning to end; firstfruitsis a Pauline term, however; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/8/23'>ROM 8:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/11/16'>11:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/16/5'>16:5</a> among other references."

NABRE,53,3,6,"[1] Some members of the community, probably because they regarded the parousia as imminent or the new age of the Lord to be already here (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/2'>2TS 2:2</a>), had apparently ceased to work for a living. The disciplinary problem they posed could be rooted in distorted thinking about Pauls own teaching (cf. <a href='/NABRE/52/2/16'>1TS 2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/3/3'>3:3-4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/5/4'>5:4-5</a>) or, more likely, in a forged letter (<a href='/NABRE/53/2/2'>2TS 2:2</a>) and the type of teaching dealt with in <a href='/NABRE/53/2/1'>2TS 2:1-15</a>. The apostles own moral teaching, reflected in his selfless labors for others, was rooted in a deep doctrinal concern for the gospel message (cf. <a href='/NABRE/52/2/3'>1TS 2:3-10</a>)."

NABRE,54,1,8,"[4] 1:8-11 Those responsible for the speculations that are to be suppressed by Timothy do not present the Old Testament from the Christian viewpoint. The Christian values the Old Testament not as a system of law but as the first stage in Gods revelation of his saving plan, which is brought to fulfillment in the good news of salvation through faith in Jesus Christ."

NABRE,54,1,11,"[6] 1:12-17 Present gratitude for the Christian apostleship leads Paul to recall an earlier time when he had been a fierce persecutor of the Christian communities (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/26/9'>ACT 26:9-11</a>) until his conversion by intervention of divine mercy through the appearance of Jesus. This and his subsequent apostolic experience testify to the saving purpose of Jesus incarnation. The fact of his former ignorance of the truth has not kept the apostle from regarding himself as having been the worst of sinners (<a href='/NABRE/54/1/15'>1TM 1:15</a>). Yet he was chosen to be an apostle, that God might manifest his firm will to save sinful humanity through Jesus Christ (<a href='/NABRE/54/1/16'>1TM 1:16</a>). The recounting of so great a mystery leads to a spontaneous outpouring of adoration (<a href='/NABRE/54/1/17'>1TM 1:17</a>)."
NABRE,54,1,15,[7] This saying is trustworthy: this phrase regularly introduces in the Pastorals a basic truth of early Christian faith; cf. <a href='/NABRE/54/3/1'>1TM 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/4/9'>4:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/55/2/11'>2TM 2:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/56/3/8'>TIT 3:8</a>.

NABRE,54,1,17,"[9] 1:18-20 Timothy is to be mindful of his calling, which is here compared to the way Barnabas and Saul were designated by Christ as prophets for missionary service; cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/13/1'>ACT 13:1-3</a>. Such is probably the sense of the allusion to the prophetic words (<a href='/NABRE/54/1/18'>1TM 1:18</a>). His task is not to yield, whether in doctrine or in conduct, to erroneous opinions, taking warning from what has already happened at Ephesus in the case of Hymenaeus and Alexander (<a href='/NABRE/54/1/19'>1TM 1:19-20</a>)."
NABRE,54,1,18,"[10] The prophetic words once spoken about you: the Greek may also be translated, ""the prophecies that led (me) to you."" It probably refers to testimonies given by charismatic figures in the Christian communities. Fight a good fight: this translation preserves the play on words in Greek. The Greek terms imply a lengthy engagement in battle and might well be translated ""wage a good campaign."""
NABRE,54,1,20,"[11] Hymenaeus: mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/55/2/17'>2TM 2:17</a> as saying that the resurrection has already taken place (in baptism). Alexander: probably the Alexander mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/55/4/14'>2TM 4:14</a> as the coppersmith who ""did me a great deal of harm."" Whom I have handed over to Satan: the same terms are used in the condemnation of the incestuous man in <a href='/NABRE/46/5/5'>1CO 5:5</a>."
NABRE,54,2,1,"[1] 2:1-7 This marked insistence that the liturgical prayer of the community concern itself with the needs of all, whether Christian or not, and especially of those in authority, may imply that a disposition existed at Ephesus to refuse prayer for pagans. In actuality, such prayer aids the community to achieve peaceful relationships with non-Christians (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/2'>1TM 2:2</a>) and contributes to salvation, since it derives its value from the presence within the community of Christ, who is the one and only savior of all (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/3'>1TM 2:3-6</a>). The vital apostolic mission to the Gentiles (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/7'>1TM 2:7</a>) reflects Christs purpose of universal salvation. <a href='/NABRE/54/2/5'>1TM 2:5</a> contains what may well have been a very primitive creed. Some interpreters have called it a Christian version of the Jewish shema: ""Hear, O Israel, the Lordis our God, the Lordalone…"" (<a href='/NABRE/5/6/4'>DEU 6:4-5</a>). The assertion in <a href='/NABRE/54/2/7'>1TM 2:7</a>, ""I am speaking the truth, I am not lying,"" reminds one of similar affirmations in <a href='/NABRE/45/9/1'>ROM 9:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/47/11/31'>2CO 11:31</a>; and <a href='/NABRE/48/1/20'>GAL 1:20</a>."

At the liturgical assembly the dress of women should be appropriate to the occasion (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/9'>1TM 2:9</a>); their chief adornment is to be reputation for good works (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/10'>1TM 2:10</a>). Women are not to take part in the charismatic activity of the assembly (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/11'>1TM 2:11-12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/14/34'>1CO 14:34</a>) or exercise authority; their conduct there should reflect the role of mans helpmate (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/13'>1TM 2:13</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/18'>GEN 2:18</a>) and not the later relationship of Eve to Adam (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/14'>1TM 2:14</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/3/6'>GEN 3:6-7</a>).

NABRE,54,3,1,"[1] 3:1-7 The passage begins by commending those who aspire to the office of bishop (episkopos; see note on <a href='/NABRE/50/1/1'>PHL 1:1</a>) within the community, but this first sentence (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/1'>1TM 3:1</a>) may also imply a warning about the great responsibilities involved. The writer proceeds to list the qualifications required: personal stability and graciousness; talent for teaching (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/2'>1TM 3:2</a>); moderation in habits and temperament (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/3'>1TM 3:3</a>); managerial ability (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/4'>1TM 3:4</a>); and experience in Christian living (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/5'>1TM 3:5-6</a>). Moreover, the candidates previous life should provide no grounds for the charge that he did not previously practice what he now preaches. No list of qualifications for presbyters appears in 1 Timothy. The presbyter-bishops here and in Titus (see note on <a href='/NABRE/56/1/5'>TIT 1:5-9</a>) lack certain functions reserved here for Paul and Timothy."
NABRE,54,3,1,"[2] This saying is trustworthy: the saying introduced is so unlike others after this phrase that some later Western manuscripts read, ""This saying is popular."" It is understood by some interpreters as concluding the preceding section (<a href='/NABRE/54/2/8'>1TM 2:8-15</a>). Bishop: literally, ""overseer""; see note on <a href='/NABRE/50/1/1'>PHL 1:1</a>."
NABRE,54,3,6,[3] The devils punishment: this phrase could mean the punishment once incurred by the devil (objective genitive) or a punishment brought about by the devil (subjective genitive).
NABRE,54,3,8,"[4] 3:8-13 Deacons, besides possessing the virtue of moderation (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/8'>1TM 3:8</a>), are to be outstanding for their faith (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/9'>1TM 3:9</a>) and well respected within the community (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/10'>1TM 3:10</a>). Women in the same role, although some interpreters take them to mean wives of deacons, must be dignified, temperate, dedicated, and not given to malicious talebearing (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/11'>1TM 3:11</a>). Deacons must have shown stability in marriage and have a good record with their families (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/12'>1TM 3:12</a>), for such experience prepares them well for the exercise of their ministry on behalf of the community (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/13'>1TM 3:13</a>). See further the note on <a href='/NABRE/50/1/1'>PHL 1:1</a>."
NABRE,54,3,11,"[5] Women: this seems to refer to women deacons but may possibly mean wives of deacons. The former is preferred because the word is used absolutely; if deacons wives were meant, a possessive ""their"" would be expected. Moreover, they are also introduced by the word ""similarly,"" as in <a href='/NABRE/54/3/8'>1TM 3:8</a>; this parallel suggests that they too exercised ecclesiastical functions."
NABRE,54,3,13,"[6] 3:14-16 In case there is some delay in the visit to Timothy at Ephesus planned for the near future, the present letter is being sent on ahead to arm and enlighten him in his task of preserving sound Christian conduct in the Ephesian church. The care he must exercise over this community is required by the profound nature of Christianity. It centers in Christ, appearing in human flesh, vindicated by the holy Spirit; the mystery of his person was revealed to the angels, announced to the Gentiles, and accepted by them in faith. He himself was taken up (through his resurrection and ascension) to the divine glory (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/16'>1TM 3:16</a>). This passage apparently includes part of a liturgical hymn used among the Christian communities in and around Ephesus. It consists of three couplets in typical Hebrew balance: flesh-spirit (contrast), seen-proclaimed (complementary), world-glory (contrast)."
NABRE,54,3,16,"[7] Who: the reference is to Christ, who is himself ""the mystery of our devotion."" Some predominantly Western manuscripts read ""which,"" harmonizing the gender of the pronoun with that of the Greek word for mystery; many later (eighth/ninth century on), predominantly Byzantine manuscripts read ""God,"" possibly for theological reasons."
NABRE,54,4,1,"[1] 4:1-5 Doctrinal deviations from the true Christian message within the church have been prophesied, though the origin of the prophecy is not specified (<a href='/NABRE/54/4/1'>1TM 4:1-2</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/20/29'>ACT 20:29-30</a>.

NABRE,54,4,5,"[2] The invocation of God in prayer: literally, ""the word of God and petition."" The use of ""word of God"" without an article in Greek suggests that it refers to the name of God being invoked in blessing rather than to the ""word of God"" proclaimed to the community."

NABRE,54,4,13,"[7] Reading: the Greek word refers to private or public reading. Here, it probably designates the public reading of scripture in the Christian assembly."
NABRE,54,4,14,"[8] Prophetic word: this may mean the utterance of a Christian prophet designating the candidate or a prayer of blessing accompanying the rite. Imposition of hands: this gesture was used in the Old Testament to signify the transmission of authority from Moses to Joshua (<a href='/NABRE/4/27/18'>NUM 27:18-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/34/9'>DEU 34:9</a>). The early Christian community used it as a symbol of installation into an office: the Seven (<a href='/NABRE/44/6/6'>ACT 6:6</a>) and Paul and Barnabas (<a href='/NABRE/44/13/3'>ACT 13:3</a>). Of the presbyterate: this would mean that each member of the college of presbyters imposed hands and appears to contradict <a href='/NABRE/55/1/6'>2TM 1:6</a>, in which Paul says that he imposed hands on Timothy. This latter text, however, does not exclude participation by others in the rite. Some prefer to translate ""for the presbyterate,"" and thus understand it to designate the office into which Timothy was installed rather than the agents who installed him."
NABRE,54,5,1,"[1] 5:1-16 After a few words of general advice based on common sense (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/1'>1TM 5:1-2</a>), the letter takes up, in its several aspects, the subject of widows. The first responsibility for their care belongs to the family circle, not to the Christian community as such (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/3'>1TM 5:3-4</a>, <a href='/NABRE/54/5/16'>16</a>). The widow left without the aid of relatives may benefit the community by her prayer, and the community should consider her material sustenance its responsibility (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/5'>1TM 5:5-8</a>). Widows who wish to work directly for the Christian community should not be accepted unless they are well beyond the probability of marriage, i.e., sixty years of age, married only once, and with a reputation for good works (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/9'>1TM 5:9-10</a>). Younger widows are apt to be troublesome and should be encouraged to remarry (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/11'>1TM 5:11-15</a>)."
NABRE,54,5,16,"[2] Woman believer: some early Latin manuscripts and Fathers have a masculine here, while most later manuscripts and patristic quotations conflate the two readings, perhaps to avoid unfair restriction to women."
NABRE,54,5,16,"[3] 5:17-25 The function of presbyters is not exactly the same as that of the episkopos, ""bishop"" (<a href='/NABRE/54/3/1'>1TM 3:1</a>); in fact, the relation of the two at the time of this letter is obscure (but cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/56/1/5'>TIT 1:5-9</a>). The Pastorals seem to reflect a transitional stage that developed in many regions of the church into the monarchical episcopate of the second and third centuries. The presbyters possess the responsibility of preaching and teaching, for which functions they are supported by the community (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/17'>1TM 5:17-18</a>). The realization that their position subjects them to adverse criticism is implied in the direction to Timothy (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/19'>1TM 5:19-20</a>) to make sure of the truth of any accusation against them before public reproof is given. He must be as objective as possible in weighing charges against presbyters (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/21'>1TM 5:21</a>), learning from his experience to take care in selecting them (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/22'>1TM 5:22</a>). Some scholars take <a href='/NABRE/54/5/22'>1TM 5:22</a> as a reference not to ordination of presbyters but to reconciliation of public sinners. The letter now sounds an informal note of personal concern in its advice to Timothy not to be so ascetic that he even avoids wine (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/23'>1TM 5:23</a>). Judgment concerning the fitness of candidates to serve as presbyters is easy with persons of open conduct, more difficult and prolonged with those of greater reserve (<a href='/NABRE/54/5/24'>1TM 5:24-25</a>)."

The suggestion seems to be that the important gain that religion brings is spiritual, but that there is material gain, too, up to the point of what is needed for physical sustenance (cf. <a href='/NABRE/54/6/17'>1TM 6:17-19</a>)."

Characteristic of the various gnostic systems of speculation was an elaborate mythology of innumerable superhuman intermediaries, on a descending scale (""genealogies""), between God and the world. Thus would be explained the emphasis upon Christs being the one mediator (as in <a href='/NABRE/54/2/5'>1TM 2:5</a>).

NABRE,58,1,1,"[16] 1:1-4 The letter opens with an introduction consisting of a reflection on the climax of Gods revelation to the human race in his Son. The divine communication was initiated and maintained during Old Testament times in fragmentary and varied ways through the prophets(<a href='/NABRE/58/1/1'>HEB 1:1</a>), including Abraham, Moses, and all through whom God spoke. But now in these last days(<a href='/NABRE/58/1/2'>HEB 1:2</a>) the final age, Gods revelation of his saving purpose is achieved through a son, i.e., one who is Son, whose role is redeemer and mediator of creation. He was made heir of all thingsthrough his death and exaltation to glory, yet he existed before he appeared as man; through him God created the universe. <a href='/NABRE/58/1/3'>HEB 1:3-4</a>, which may be based upon a liturgical hymn, assimilate the Son to the personified Wisdom of the Old Testament as refulgence ofGods gloryand imprint of his being(<a href='/NABRE/58/1/3'>HEB 1:3</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/70/7/26'>WIS 7:26</a>). These same terms are used of the Logos in Philo. The author now turns from the cosmological role of the preexistent Son to the redemptive work of Jesus: he brought about purification from sins and has been exalted to the right hand of God (see <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a>). The once-humiliated and crucified Jesus has been declared Gods Son, and this name shows his superiority to the angels. The reason for the authors insistence on that superiority is, among other things, that in some Jewish traditions angels were mediators of the old covenant (see <a href='/NABRE/44/7/53'>ACT 7:53</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/19'>GAL 3:19</a>). Finally, Jesus superiority to the angels emphasizes the superiority of the new covenant to the old because of the heavenly priesthood of Jesus."
NABRE,58,1,5,"[17] 1:5-14 Jesus superiority to the angels is now demonstrated by a series of seven Old Testament texts. Some scholars see in the stages of Jesus exaltation an order corresponding to that of enthronement ceremonies in the ancient Near East, especially in Egypt, namely, elevation to divine status (<a href='/NABRE/58/1/5'>HEB 1:5-6</a>); presentation to the angels and proclamation of everlasting lordship (<a href='/NABRE/58/1/7'>HEB 1:7-12</a>); enthronement and conferral of royal power (<a href='/NABRE/58/1/13'>HEB 1:13</a>). The citations from the Psalms in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/5'>HEB 1:5, 13</a> were traditionally used of Jesus messianic sonship (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/13/33'>ACT 13:33</a>) through his resurrection and exaltation (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/2/33'>ACT 2:33-35</a>); those in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/8'>HEB 1:8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/1/10'>10-12</a> are concerned with his divine kingship and his creative function. The central quotation in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/7'>HEB 1:7</a> serves to contrast the angels with the Son. The author quotes it according to the Septuagint translation, which is quite different in meaning from that of the Hebrew (""You make the winds your messengers, and flaming fire your ministers""). The angels are only sent to serve…those who are to inherit salvation(<a href='/NABRE/58/1/14'>HEB 1:14</a>)."
NABRE,58,1,6,"[18] And again, when he leads: the Greek could also be translated ""And when he again leads"" in reference to the parousia."
NABRE,58,1,8,"[19] 1:8-12 O God: the application of the name ""God"" to the Son derives from the preexistence mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/2'>HEB 1:2-3</a>; the psalmist had already used it of the Hebrew king in the court style of the original. See note on <a href='/NABRE/19/45/7'>PS 45:7</a>. It is also important for the authors christology that in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/10'>HEB 1:10-12</a> an Old Testament passage addressed to God is redirected to Jesus."
NABRE,58,2,1,"[1] 2:1-4 The author now makes a transition into exhortation, using an a fortiori argument (as at <a href='/NABRE/58/7/21'>HEB 7:21-22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/9/13'>9:13-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/10/28'>10:28-29</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/12/25'>12:25</a>). The word announced through angels(<a href='/NABRE/58/2/2'>HEB 2:2</a>), the Mosaic law, is contrasted with the more powerful word that Christians have received (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/3'>HEB 2:3-4</a>). Christs supremacy strengthens Christians against being carried awayfrom their faith."
NABRE,58,2,4,"[2] 2:5-18 The humanity and the suffering of Jesus do not constitute a valid reason for relinquishing the Christian faith. <a href='/NABRE/19/8/6'>PS 8:6-7</a> is also applied to Jesus in <a href='/NABRE/46/15/27'>1CO 15:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/1/22'>EPH 1:22</a>; and probably <a href='/NABRE/60/3/22'>1PE 3:22</a>. This christological interpretation, therefore, probably reflects a common early Christian tradition, which may have originated in the expression the son of man(<a href='/NABRE/58/2/6'>HEB 2:6</a>). The psalm contrasts Gods greatness with mans relative insignificance but also stresses the superiority of man to the rest of creation, of which he is lord. Hebrews applies this christologically: Jesus lived a truly human existence, lower than the angels, in the days of his earthly life, particularly in his suffering and death; now, crowned with glory and honor, he is raised above all creation. The author considers all things as already subject to himbecause of his exaltation (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/8'>HEB 2:8-9</a>), though we do not seethis yet. The reference to Jesus as leader(<a href='/NABRE/58/2/10'>HEB 2:10</a>) sounds the first note of an important leitmotif in Hebrews: the journey of the people of God to the sabbath rest (<a href='/NABRE/58/4/9'>HEB 4:9</a>), the heavenly sanctuary, following Jesus, their ""forerunner"" (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/20'>HEB 6:20</a>). It was fitting that God should make him perfect through suffering, consecrated by obedient suffering. Because he is perfected as high priest, Jesus is then able to consecrate his people (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/11'>HEB 2:11</a>); access to God is made possible by each of these two consecrations. If Jesus is able to help human beings, it is because he has become one of us; we are his ""brothers."" The author then cites three Old Testament texts as proofs of this unity between ourselves and the Son. <a href='/NABRE/19/22/23'>PS 22:23</a> is interpreted so as to make Jesus the singer of this lament, which ends with joyful praise of the Lord in the assembly of ""brothers."" The other two texts are from <a href='/NABRE/23/8/17'>ISA 8:17, 18</a>. The first of these seems intended to display in Jesus an example of the trust in God that his followers should emulate. The second curiously calls these followers ""children""; probably this is to be understood to mean children of Adam, but the point is our solidarity with Jesus. By sharing human nature, including the ban of death, Jesus broke the power of the devil over death (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/14'>HEB 2:14</a>); the author shares the view of Hellenistic Judaism that death was not intended by God and that it had been introduced into the world by the devil. The fear of death(<a href='/NABRE/58/2/15'>HEB 2:15</a>) is a religious fear based on the false conception that death marks the end of a persons relations with God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/115/17'>PS 115:17-18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/38/18'>ISA 38:18</a>). Jesus deliberately allied himself with the descendants of Abraham(<a href='/NABRE/58/2/16'>HEB 2:16</a>) in order to be a merciful and faithful high priest. This is the first appearance of the central theme of Hebrews, Jesus the great high priest expiating the sins of the people(<a href='/NABRE/58/2/17'>HEB 2:17</a>), as one who experienced the same tests as they (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/18'>HEB 2:18</a>)."
NABRE,58,3,1,"[1] 3:1-6 The author now takes up the two qualities of Jesus mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/58/2/17'>HEB 2:17</a>, but in inverse order: faithfulness (<a href='/NABRE/58/3/1'>HEB 3:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/58/4/13'>4:13</a>) and mercy (<a href='/NABRE/58/4/14'>HEB 4:14</a>-<a href='/NABRE/58/5/10'>5:10</a>). Christians are called holy ""brothers""because of their common relation to him (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/11'>HEB 2:11</a>), the apostle, a designation for Jesus used only here in the New Testament (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/13/16'>JHN 13:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/17/3'>17:3</a>), meaning one sent as Gods final word to us (<a href='/NABRE/58/1/2'>HEB 1:2</a>). He is compared with Moses probably because he is seen as mediator of the new covenant (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/15'>HEB 9:15</a>) just as Moses was of the old (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/19'>HEB 9:19-22</a>, including his sacrifice). But when the author of Hebrews speaks of Jesus sacrifice, he does not consider Moses as the Old Testament antitype, but rather the high priest on the Day of Atonement (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/6'>HEB 9:6-15</a>). Moses faithfulness ""in [all] his house""refers back to <a href='/NABRE/4/12/7'>NUM 12:7</a>, on which this section is a midrashic commentary. In <a href='/NABRE/58/3/3'>HEB 3:3-6</a>, the author does not indicate that he thinks of either Moses or Christ as the founder of the household. His house(<a href='/NABRE/58/3/2'>HEB 3:2, 5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/3/6'>6</a>) means Gods house, not that of Moses or Christ; in the case of Christ, compare <a href='/NABRE/58/3/6'>HEB 3:6</a> with <a href='/NABRE/58/10/21'>HEB 10:21</a>. The houseof <a href='/NABRE/58/3/6'>HEB 3:6</a> is the Christian community; the author suggests its continuity with Israel by speaking not of two houses but of only one. <a href='/NABRE/58/3/6'>HEB 3:6</a> brings out the reason why Jesus is superior to Moses: the latter was the faithful servantlaboring inthe house founded by God, but Jesus is Gods son, placed overthe house."
NABRE,58,3,6,"[2] The majority of manuscripts add ""firm to the end,"" but these words are not found in the three earliest and best witnesses and are probably an interpolation derived from <a href='/NABRE/58/3/14'>HEB 3:14</a>."
NABRE,58,3,7,"[3] 3:7-4:13 The author appeals for steadfastness of faith in Jesus, basing his warning on the experience of Israel during the Exodus. In the Old Testament the Exodus had been invoked as a symbol of the return of Israel from the Babylonian exile (<a href='/NABRE/23/42/9'>ISA 42:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/43/16'>43:16-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/23/51/9'>51:9-11</a>). In the New Testament the redemption was similarly understood as a new exodus, both in the experience of Jesus himself (<a href='/NABRE/42/9/31'>LUK 9:31</a>) and in that of his followers (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/1'>1CO 10:1-4</a>). The author cites <a href='/NABRE/19/95/7'>PS 95:7-11</a>, a salutary example of hardness of heart, as a warning against the danger of growing weary and giving up the journey. To call God living(<a href='/NABRE/58/3/12'>HEB 3:12</a>) means that he reveals himself in his works (cf. <a href='/NABRE/6/3/10'>JOS 3:10</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/10/11'>JER 10:11</a>). The rest(<a href='/NABRE/58/3/11'>HEB 3:11</a>) into which Israel was to enter was only a foreshadowing of that rest to which Christians are called. They are to remember the example of Israels revolt in the desert that cost a whole generation the loss of the promised land (<a href='/NABRE/58/3/15'>HEB 3:15-19</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/4/14/20'>NUM 14:20-29</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/58/4/1'>HEB 4:1-11</a>, the symbol of restis seen in deeper dimension: because the promise to the ancient Hebrews foreshadowed that given to Christians, it is good news; and because the promised land was the place of rest that God provided for his people, it was a share in his own rest, which he enjoyed after he had finished his creative work (<a href='/NABRE/58/3/3'>HEB 3:3-4</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/2/2'>GEN 2:2</a>). The author attempts to read this meaning of Gods rest into <a href='/NABRE/19/95/7'>PS 95:7-11</a> (<a href='/NABRE/58/3/6'>HEB 3:6-9</a>). The Greek form of the name of Joshua, who led Israel into the promised land, is Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/58/3/8'>HEB 3:8</a>). The author plays upon the name but stresses the superiority of Jesus, who leads his followers into heavenly rest. <a href='/NABRE/58/3/12'>HEB 3:12, 13</a> are meant as a continuation of the warning, for the word of God brings judgment as well as salvation. Some would capitalize the word of Godand see it as a personal title of Jesus, comparable to that of <a href='/NABRE/43/1/1'>JHN 1:1-18</a>."
NABRE,58,4,14,"[1] 4:14-16 These verses, which return to the theme first sounded in <a href='/NABRE/58/2/16'>HEB 2:16</a>-<a href='/NABRE/58/3/1'>3:1</a>, serve as an introduction to the section that follows. The author here alone calls Jesus a great high priest(<a href='/NABRE/58/4/14'>HEB 4:14</a>), a designation used by Philo for the Logos; perhaps he does so in order to emphasize Jesus superiority over the Jewish high priest. He has been tested in every way, yet without sin(<a href='/NABRE/58/4/15'>HEB 4:15</a>); this indicates an acquaintance with the tradition of Jesus temptations, not only at the beginning (as in <a href='/NABRE/41/1/13'>MAK 1:13</a>) but throughout his public life (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/22/28'>LUK 22:28</a>). Although the reign of the exalted Jesus is a theme that occurs elsewhere in Hebrews, and Jesus throne is mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/8'>HEB 1:8</a>, the throne of grace(<a href='/NABRE/58/4/16'>HEB 4:16</a>) refers to the throne of God. The similarity of <a href='/NABRE/58/4/16'>HEB 4:16</a> to <a href='/NABRE/58/10/19'>HEB 10:19-22</a> indicates that the author is thinking of our confident access to God, made possible by the priestly work of Jesus."
NABRE,58,5,1,"[1] 5:1-10 The true humanity of Jesus (see note on <a href='/NABRE/58/2/5'>HEB 2:5-18</a>) makes him a more rather than a less effective high priest to the Christian community. In Old Testament tradition, the high priest was identified with the people, guilty of personal sin just as they were (<a href='/NABRE/58/5/1'>HEB 5:1-3</a>). Even so, the office was of divine appointment (<a href='/NABRE/58/5/4'>HEB 5:4</a>), as was also the case with the sinless Christ (<a href='/NABRE/58/5/5'>HEB 5:5</a>). For <a href='/NABRE/58/5/6'>HEB 5:6</a>, see note on <a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a>. Although Jesus was Son of God, he was destined as a human being to learn obedience by accepting the suffering he had to endure (<a href='/NABRE/58/5/8'>HEB 5:8</a>). Because of his perfection through this experience of human suffering, he is the cause of salvation for all (<a href='/NABRE/58/5/9'>HEB 5:9</a>), a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek(<a href='/NABRE/58/5/10'>HEB 5:10</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/5/6'>HEB 5:6</a> and <a href='/NABRE/58/7/3'>HEB 7:3</a>)."
NABRE,58,5,1,"[2] To offer gifts and sacrifices for sins: the author is thinking principally of the Day of Atonement rite, as is clear from <a href='/NABRE/58/9/7'>HEB 9:7</a>. This ritual was celebrated to atone for ""all the sins of the Israelites"" (<a href='/NABRE/3/16/34'>LEV 16:34</a>)."
NABRE,58,5,2,[3] Deal patiently: the Greek word metriopatheinoccurs only here in the Bible; this term was used by the Stoics to designate the golden mean between excess and defect of passion. Here it means rather the ability to sympathize.
NABRE,58,5,6,"[4] 5:6-8 The author of Hebrews is the only New Testament writer to cite <a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a>, here and in <a href='/NABRE/58/7/17'>HEB 7:17, 21</a>, to show that Jesus has been called by God to his role as priest. <a href='/NABRE/58/5/7'>HEB 5:7-8</a> deal with his ability to sympathize with sinners, because of his own experience of the trials and weakness of human nature, especially fear of death. In his present exalted state, weakness is foreign to him, but he understands what we suffer because of his previous earthly experience."
NABRE,58,5,7,"[5] He offered prayers…to the one who was able to save him from death: at Gethsemane (cf. <a href='/NABRE/41/14/35'>MAK 14:35</a>), though some see a broader reference (see note on <a href='/NABRE/43/12/27'>JHN 12:27</a>)."
NABRE,58,5,8,"[6] Son though he was: two different though not incompatible views of Jesus sonship coexist in Hebrews, one associating it with his exaltation, the other with his preexistence. The former view is the older one (cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/1/4'>ROM 1:4</a>)."
NABRE,58,5,11,"[7] 5:11-6:20 The central section of Hebrews (<a href='/NABRE/58/5/11'>5:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/58/10/39'>10:39</a>) opens with a reprimand and an appeal. Those to whom the author directs his teaching about Jesus priesthood, which is difficult to explain, have become sluggish in hearingand forgetful of even the basic elements(<a href='/NABRE/58/5/12'>HEB 5:12</a>). But rather than treating of basic teachings, the author apparently believes that the challenge of more advanced ones may shake them out of their inertia (therefore, <a href='/NABRE/58/6/1'>HEB 6:1</a>). The six examples of basic teachingin <a href='/NABRE/58/6/1'>HEB 6:1-3</a> are probably derived from a traditional catechetical list. No effort is made to address apostates, for their very hostility to the Christian message cuts them off completely from Christ (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/4'>HEB 6:4-8</a>). This harsh statement seems to rule out repentance after apostasy, but perhaps the author deliberately uses hyperbole in order to stress the seriousness of abandoning Christ. With <a href='/NABRE/58/6/9'>HEB 6:9</a> a milder tone is introduced, and the criticism of the community (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/1'>HEB 6:1-3</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/6/9'>9</a>) is now balanced by an expression of confidence that its members are living truly Christian lives, and that God will justly reward their efforts (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/10'>HEB 6:10</a>). The author is concerned especially about their persevering (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/11'>HEB 6:11-12</a>), citing in this regard the achievement of Abraham, who relied on Gods promise and on Gods oath (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/13'>HEB 6:13-18</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/22/16'>GEN 22:16</a>), and proposes to them as a firm anchor of Christian hope the high priesthood of Christ, who is now living with God (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/19'>HEB 6:19-20</a>)."
NABRE,58,6,2,"[1] Instruction about baptisms: not simply about Christian baptism but about the difference between it and similar Jewish rites, such as proselyte baptism, Johns baptism, and the washings of the Qumran sectaries. Laying on of hands: in <a href='/NABRE/44/8/17'>ACT 8:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/19/6'>19:6</a> this rite effects the infusion of the holy Spirit; in <a href='/NABRE/44/6/6'>ACT 6:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/13/3'>13:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/4/14'>1TM 4:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/5/22'>5:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/55/1/6'>2TM 1:6</a> it is a means of conferring some ministry or mission in the early Christian community."
NABRE,58,6,4,"[2] Enlightened and tasted the heavenly gift: this may refer to baptism and the Eucharist, respectively, but more probably means the neophytes enlightenment by faith and their experience of salvation."
NABRE,58,6,5,[3] Tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come: the proclamation of the word of Godwas accompanied by signs of the Spirits power (<a href='/NABRE/52/1/5'>1TS 1:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/2/4'>1CO 2:4</a>).
NABRE,58,6,6,"[4] They are recrucifying the Son of God for themselves: a colorful description of the malice of apostasy, which is portrayed as again crucifying and deriding the Son of God."
NABRE,58,6,12,"[5] Imitators of those…inheriting the promises: the author urges the addressees to imitate the faith of the holy people of the Old Testament, who now possess the promised goods of which they lived in hope. This theme will be treated fully in <a href='/NABRE/58/6/11'>HEB 6:11</a>."
NABRE,58,6,13,"[6] He swore by himself: Gods promise to Abraham, which he confirmed by an oath (""I swear by myself,"" <a href='/NABRE/1/22/16'>GEN 22:16</a>) was the basis for the hope of all Abrahams descendants."
NABRE,58,6,15,[7] He obtained the promise: this probably refers not to Abrahams temporary possession of the land but to the eschatological blessings that Abraham and the other patriarchs have now come to possess.
NABRE,58,6,18,"[8] Two immutable things: the promise and the oath, both made by God."
NABRE,58,6,19,"[9] Anchor…into the interior behind the veil: a mixed metaphor. The Holy of Holies, beyond the veil that separates it from the Holy Place (<a href='/NABRE/2/26/31'>EXO 26:31-33</a>), is seen as the earthly counterpart of the heavenly abode of God. This theme will be developed in <a href='/NABRE/58/9/1'>HEB 9</a>."
NABRE,58,7,1,"[1] 7:1-3 Recalling the meeting between Melchizedek and Abraham described in <a href='/NABRE/1/14/17'>GEN 14:17-20</a>, the author enhances the significance of this priest by providing the popular etymological meaning of his name and that of the city over which he ruled (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/2'>HEB 7:2</a>). Since Genesis gives no information on the parentage or the death of Melchizedek, he is seen here as a type of Christ, representing a priesthood that is unique and eternal (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/3'>HEB 7:3</a>)."
NABRE,58,7,1,[2] The author here assumes that Melchizedek was a priest of the God of Israel (cf. <a href='/NABRE/1/14/22'>GEN 14:22</a> and the note there).
NABRE,58,7,2,"[3] In <a href='/NABRE/1/14/1'>GEN 14</a>, the Hebrew text does not state explicitly who gave tithes to whom. The author of Hebrews supplies Abraham as the subject, according to a contemporary interpretation of the passage. This supports the argument of the midrash and makes it possible to see in Melchizedek a type of Jesus. The messianic blessings of righteousness and peace are foreshadowed in the names ""Melchizedek"" and ""Salem."""
NABRE,58,7,3,"[4] Without father, mother, or ancestry, without beginning of days or end of life: this is perhaps a quotation from a hymn about Melchizedek. The rabbis maintained that anything not mentioned in the Torah does not exist. Consequently, since the Old Testament nowhere mentions Melchizedeks ancestry, birth, or death, the conclusion can be drawn that he remains…forever."
NABRE,58,7,4,"[5] 7:4-10 The tithe that Abraham gave to Melchizedek (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/4'>HEB 7:4</a>), a practice later followed by the levitical priesthood (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/5'>HEB 7:5</a>), was a gift (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/6'>HEB 7:6</a>) acknowledging a certain superiority in Melchizedek, the foreign priest (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/7'>HEB 7:7</a>). This is further indicated by the fact that the institution of the levitical priesthood was sustained by hereditary succession in the tribe of Levi, whereas the absence of any mention of Melchizedeks death in Genesis implies that his personal priesthood is permanent (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/8'>HEB 7:8</a>). The levitical priesthood itself, through Abraham, its ancestor, paid tithes to Melchizedek, thus acknowledging the superiority of his priesthood over its own (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/9'>HEB 7:9-10</a>)."
NABRE,58,7,7,"[6] A lesser person is blessed by a greater: though this sounds like a principle, there are some examples in the Old Testament that do not support it (cf. <a href='/NABRE/10/14/22'>2SM 14:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/18/31/20'>JOB 31:20</a>). The author may intend it as a statement of a liturgical rule."
NABRE,58,7,9,[7] Levi: for the author this name designates not only the son of Jacob mentioned in Genesis but the priestly tribe that was thought to be descended from him.
NABRE,58,7,11,"[8] 7:11-14 The levitical priesthood was not typified by the priesthood of Melchizedek, for <a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a> speaks of a priesthood of a new order, the order of Melchizedek, to arise in messianic times (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/11'>HEB 7:11</a>). Since the levitical priesthood served the Mosaic law, a new priesthood (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/12'>HEB 7:12</a>) would not come into being without a change in the law itself. Thus Jesus was not associated with the Old Testament priesthood, for he was a descendant of the tribe of Judah, which had never exercised the priesthood (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/13'>HEB 7:13-14</a>)."
NABRE,58,7,13,"[9] He of whom these things are said: Jesus, the priest ""according to the order of Melchizedek."" According to the authors interpretation, <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110</a> spoke prophetically of Jesus."
NABRE,58,7,14,"[10] Judah: the author accepts the early Christian tradition that Jesus was descended from the family of David (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/1/1'>MAT 1:1-2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/1/16'>16</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/1/20'>20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/1/27'>LUK 1:27</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/2/4'>2:4</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/1/3'>ROM 1:3</a>). The Qumran community expected two Messiahs, one descended from Aaron and one from David; Hebrews shows no awareness of this view or at least does not accept it. Our authors view is not attested in contemporaneous Judaism."
NABRE,58,7,15,"[11] 7:15-19 Jesus does not exercise a priesthood through family lineage but through his immortal existence (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/15'>HEB 7:15-16</a>), fulfilling <a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a> (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/17'>HEB 7:17</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/7/3'>HEB 7:3</a>). Thus he abolishes forever both the levitical priesthood and the law it serves, because neither could effectively sanctify people (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/18'>HEB 7:18</a>) by leading them into direct communication with God (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/19'>HEB 7:19</a>)."
NABRE,58,7,16,[12] A life that cannot be destroyed: the life to which Jesus has attained by virtue of his resurrection; it is his exaltation rather than his divine nature that makes him priest. The Old Testament speaks of the Aaronic priesthood as eternal (see <a href='/NABRE/2/40/15'>EXO 40:15</a>); our author does not explicitly consider this possible objection to his argument but implicitly refutes it in <a href='/NABRE/58/7/23'>HEB 7:23-24</a>.
NABRE,58,7,19,"[13] A better hope: this hope depends upon the sacrifice of the Son of God; through it we ""approach the throne of grace"" (<a href='/NABRE/58/4/16'>HEB 4:16</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/6/19'>HEB 6:19, 20</a>."
NABRE,58,7,20,"[14] 7:20-25 As was the case with the promise to Abraham (<a href='/NABRE/58/6/13'>HEB 6:13</a>), though not with the levitical priesthood, the eternal priesthood of the order of Melchizedek was confirmed by Gods oath (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/20'>HEB 7:20-21</a>); cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a>. Thus Jesus becomes the guarantee of a permanent covenant (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/22'>HEB 7:22</a>) that does not require a succession of priests as did the levitical priesthood (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/23'>HEB 7:23</a>) because his high priesthood is eternal and unchangeable (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/24'>HEB 7:24</a>). Consequently, Jesus is able to save all who draw near to God through him since he is their ever-living intercessor (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/25'>HEB 7:25</a>)."
NABRE,58,7,20,[15] An oath: Gods oath in <a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a>.
NABRE,58,7,22,"[16] An [even] better covenant: better than the Mosaic covenant because it will be eternal, like the priesthood of Jesus upon which it is based. <a href='/NABRE/58/7/12'>HEB 7:12</a> argued that a change of priesthood involves a change of law; since ""law"" and ""covenant"" are used correlatively, a new covenant is likewise instituted."
NABRE,58,7,25,"[17] To make intercession: the intercession of the exalted Jesus, not the sequel to his completed sacrifice but its eternal presence in heaven; cf. <a href='/NABRE/45/8/34'>ROM 8:34</a>."
NABRE,58,7,26,"[18] This verse with its list of attributes is reminiscent of <a href='/NABRE/58/7/3'>HEB 7:3</a> and is perhaps a hymnic counterpart to it, contrasting the exalted Jesus with Melchizedek."
NABRE,58,7,26,"[19] 7:26-28 Jesus is precisely the high priest whom the human race requires, holy and sinless, installed far above humanity (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/26'>HEB 7:26</a>); one having no need to offer sacrifice daily for sins but making a single offering of himself (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/27'>HEB 7:27</a>) once for all. The law could only appoint high priests with human limitations, but the fulfillment of Gods oath regarding the priesthood of Melchizedek (<a href='/NABRE/19/110/4'>PS 110:4</a>) makes the Son of God the perfect priest forever (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/28'>HEB 7:28</a>)."
NABRE,58,7,27,[20] Such daily sacrifice is nowhere mentioned in the Mosaic law; only on the Day of Atonement is it prescribed that the high priest must offer sacrifice…for his own sins and then for those of the people(<a href='/NABRE/3/16/11'>LEV 16:11-19</a>). Once for all: this translates the Greek words ephapax/hapaxthat occur eleven times in Hebrews.
NABRE,58,8,1,"[1] 8:1-6 The Christian community has in Jesus the kind of high priest described in <a href='/NABRE/58/7/26'>HEB 7:26-28</a>. In virtue of his ascension Jesus has taken his place at Gods right hand in accordance with <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a> (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/1'>HEB 8:1</a>), where he presides over the heavenly sanctuary established by God himself (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/2'>HEB 8:2</a>). Like every high priest, he has his offering to make (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/3'>HEB 8:3</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/9/12'>HEB 9:12, 14</a>), but it differs from that of the levitical priesthood in which he had no share (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/4'>HEB 8:4</a>) and which was in any case but a shadowy reflection of the true offering in the heavenly sanctuary (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/5'>HEB 8:5</a>). But Jesus ministry in the heavenly sanctuary is that of mediator of a superior covenant that accomplishes what it signifies (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/6'>HEB 8:6</a>)."
NABRE,58,8,2,"[2] The sanctuary: the Greek term could also mean ""holy things"" but bears the meaning ""sanctuary"" elsewhere in Hebrews (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/8'>HEB 9:8, 12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/9/24'>24</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/9/25'>25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/10/19'>10:19</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/13/11'>13:11</a>). The true tabernacle: the heavenly tabernacle that the Lord…set upis contrasted with the earthly tabernacle that Moses set up in the desert. Truemeans ""real"" in contradistinction to a mere ""copy and shadow"" (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/5'>HEB 8:5</a>); compare the Johannine usage (e.g., <a href='/NABRE/43/1/9'>JHN 1:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/6/32'>6:32</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/15/1'>15:1</a>). The idea that the earthly sanctuary is a reflection of a heavenly model may be based upon <a href='/NABRE/2/25/9'>EXO 25:9</a>, but probably also derives from the Platonic concept of a real world of which our observable world is merely a shadow."
NABRE,58,8,6,"[3] 8:7-13 Since the first covenant was deficient in accomplishing what it signified, it had to be replaced (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/7'>HEB 8:7</a>), as Jeremiah (<a href='/NABRE/24/31/31'>JER 31:31-34</a>) had prophesied (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/8'>HEB 8:8-12</a>). Even in the time of Jeremiah, the first covenant was antiquated (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/13'>HEB 8:13</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/58/7/22'>HEB 7:22-24</a>, the superiority of the new covenant was seen in the permanence of its priesthood; here the superiority is based on better promises, made explicit in the citation of <a href='/NABRE/24/31/31'>JER 31:31-34</a> (LXX: 38), namely, in the immediacy of the peoples knowledge of God (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/11'>HEB 8:11</a>) and in the forgiveness of sin (<a href='/NABRE/58/8/12'>HEB 8:12</a>)."
NABRE,58,8,8,[4] 8:8-12 In citing Jeremiah the author follows the Septuagint; some apparent departures from it may be the result of a different Septuagintal text rather than changes deliberately introduced.
NABRE,58,8,13,"[5] Close to disappearing: from the prophets perspective, not that of the author of Hebrews."
NABRE,58,9,1,"[1] 9:1-10 The regulations for worship under the old covenant permitted all the priests to enter the Holy Place (<a href='/NABRE/58/2/6'>HEB 2:6</a>), but only the high priest to enter the Holy of Holies and then only once a year (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/3'>HEB 9:3-5</a>, <a href='/NABRE/58/9/7'>7</a>). The description of the sanctuary and its furnishings is taken essentially from <a href='/NABRE/2/25/1'>EXO 25</a>-<a href='/NABRE/2/26/1'>26</a>. This exclusion of the people from the Holy of Holies signified that they were not allowed to stand in Gods presence (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/8'>HEB 9:8</a>) because their offerings and sacrifices, which were merely symbols of their need of spiritual renewal (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/10'>HEB 9:10</a>), could not obtain forgiveness of sins (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/9'>HEB 9:9</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,2,[2] The outer one: the author speaks of the outer tabernacle(<a href='/NABRE/58/9/6'>HEB 9:6</a>) and the inner one(<a href='/NABRE/58/9/7'>HEB 9:7</a>) rather than of one Mosaic tabernacle divided into two parts or sections.
NABRE,58,9,3,"[3] The second veil: what is meant is the veil that divided the Holy Place from the Holy of Holies. It is here called the second, because there was another veil at the entrance to the Holy Place, or ""outer tabernacle"" (<a href='/NABRE/2/26/36'>EXO 26:36</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,4,"[4] The gold altar of incense: <a href='/NABRE/2/30/6'>EXO 30:6</a> locates this altar in the Holy Place, i.e., the first tabernacle, rather than in the Holy of Holies. Neither is there any Old Testament support for the assertion that the jar of manna and the staff of Aaron were in the ark of the covenant. For the tablets of the covenant, see <a href='/NABRE/2/25/16'>EXO 25:16</a>."
NABRE,58,9,5,"[5] The place of expiation: the gold ""mercy seat"" (Greek hilastērion, as in <a href='/NABRE/45/3/25'>ROM 3:25</a>), where the blood of the sacrificial animals was sprinkled on the Day of Atonement (<a href='/NABRE/3/16/14'>LEV 16:14-15</a>). This rite achieved ""expiation"" or atonement for the sins of the preceding year."
NABRE,58,9,6,"[6] In performing their service: the priestly services that had to be performed regularly in the Holy Place or outer tabernacleincluded burning incense on the incense altar twice each day (<a href='/NABRE/2/30/7'>EXO 30:7</a>), replacing the loaves on the table of the bread of offering once each week (<a href='/NABRE/3/24/8'>LEV 24:8</a>), and constantly caring for the lamps on the lampstand (<a href='/NABRE/2/27/21'>EXO 27:21</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,7,"[7] Not without blood: blood was essential to Old Testament sacrifice because it was believed that life was located in the blood. Hence blood was especially sacred, and its outpouring functioned as a meaningful symbol of cleansing from sin and reconciliation with God. Unlike Hebrews, the Old Testament never says that the blood is ""offered."" The author is perhaps retrojecting into his description of Mosaic ritual a concept that belongs to the New Testament antitype, as Paul does when he speaks of the Israelites passage through the sea as a ""baptism"" (<a href='/NABRE/46/10/2'>1CO 10:2</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,9,"[8] The present time: this expression is equivalent to the ""present age,"" used in contradistinction to the ""age to come."""
NABRE,58,9,11,"[9] 9:11-14 Christ, the high priest of the spiritual blessings foreshadowed in the Old Testament sanctuary, has actually entered the true sanctuary of heaven that is not of human making (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/11'>HEB 9:11</a>). His place there is permanent, and his offering is his own blood that won eternal redemption (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/12'>HEB 9:12</a>). If the sacrifice of animals could bestow legal purification (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/13'>HEB 9:13</a>), how much more effective is the blood of the sinless, divine Christ who spontaneously offered himself to purge the human race of sin and render it fit for the service of God (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/14'>HEB 9:14</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,11,"[10] The good things that have come to be: the majority of later manuscripts here read ""the good things to come""; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/10/1'>HEB 10:1</a>."
NABRE,58,9,13,"[11] A heifers ashes: ashes from a red heifer that had been burned were mixed with water and used for the cleansing of those who had become ritually defiled by touching a corpse; see <a href='/NABRE/4/19/9'>NUM 19:9</a>, <a href='/NABRE/4/19/14'>14-21</a>."
NABRE,58,9,14,"[12] Through the eternal spirit: this expression does not refer either to the holy Spirit or to the divine nature of Jesus but to the life of the risen Christ, ""a life that cannot be destroyed"" (<a href='/NABRE/58/7/16'>HEB 7:16</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,15,"[13] 9:15-22 Jesus role as mediator of the new covenantis based upon his sacrificial death(cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/8/6'>HEB 8:6</a>). His death has effected deliverance from transgressions, i.e., deliverance from sins committed under the old covenant, which the Mosaic sacrifices were incapable of effacing. Until this happened, the eternal inheritancepromised by God could not be obtained (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/15'>HEB 9:15</a>). This effect of his work follows the human pattern by which a last will and testament becomes effective only with the death of the testator (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/16'>HEB 9:16-17</a>). The Mosaic covenant was also associated with death, for Moses made use of blood to seal the pact between God and the people (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/18'>HEB 9:18-21</a>). In Old Testament tradition, guilt could normally not be remitted without the use of blood (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/22'>HEB 9:22</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/17/11'>LEV 17:11</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,16,"[14] 9:16-17 A will…death of the testator: the same Greek word diathēkē, meaning ""covenant"" in <a href='/NABRE/58/9/15'>HEB 9:15, 18</a>, is used here with the meaning will. The new covenant, unlike the old, is at the same time a will that requires the death of the testator. Jesus as eternal Son is the one who established the new covenant together with his Father, author of both covenants; at the same time he is the testator whose death puts his willinto effect."
NABRE,58,9,19,"[15] 9:19-20 A number of details here are different from the description of this covenant rite in <a href='/NABRE/2/24/5'>EXO 24:5-8</a>. Exodus mentions only calves (""young bulls,"" NAB), not goats (but this addition in Hebrews is of doubtful authenticity), says nothing of the use of water and crimson wool and hyssop(these features probably came from a different rite; cf. <a href='/NABRE/3/14/3'>LEV 14:3-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/4/19/6'>NUM 19:6-18</a>), and describes Moses as splashing blood on the altar, whereas Hebrews says he sprinkled it on the book (but both book and altar are meant to symbolize the agreement of God). The words of Moses are also slightly different from those in Exodus and are closer to the words of Jesus at the Last Supper in <a href='/NABRE/41/14/24'>MAK 14:24</a> || <a href='/NABRE/40/26/28'>MAT 26:28</a>."
NABRE,58,9,21,"[16] According to Exodus, the tabernacle did not yet exist at the time of the covenant rite. Moreover, nothing is said of sprinkling it with blood at its subsequent dedication (<a href='/NABRE/2/40/9'>EXO 40:9-11</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,22,"[17] Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness: in fact, ancient Israel did envisage other means of obtaining forgiveness; the Old Testament mentions contrition of heart (<a href='/NABRE/19/51/17'>PS 51:17</a>), fasting (<a href='/NABRE/29/2/12'>JOE 2:12</a>), and almsgiving (<a href='/NABRE/71/3/29'>SIR 3:29</a>). The author is limiting his horizon to the sacrificial cult, which did always involve the shedding of blood for its expiatory and unitive value."
NABRE,58,9,23,"[18] 9:23-28 Since the blood of animals became a cleansing symbol among Old Testament prefigurements, it was necessary that the realities foreshadowed be brought into being by a shedding of blood that was infinitely more effective by reason of its worth (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/23'>HEB 9:23</a>). Christ did not simply prefigure the heavenly realities (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/24'>HEB 9:24</a>) by performing an annual sacrifice with a blood not his own (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/25'>HEB 9:25</a>); he offered the single sacrifice of himself as the final annulment of sin (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/26'>HEB 9:26</a>). Just as death is the unrepeatable act that ends a persons life, so Christs offering of himself for all is the unrepeatable sacrifice that has once for all achieved redemption (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/27'>HEB 9:27-28</a>)."
NABRE,58,9,26,"[19] At the end of the ages: the use of expressions such as this shows that the author of Hebrews, despite his interest in the Platonic concept of an eternal world above superior to temporal reality here below, nevertheless still clings to the Jewish Christian eschatology with its sequence of ""the present age"" and ""the age to come."""
NABRE,58,9,28,"[20] To take away the sins of many: the reference is to <a href='/NABRE/23/53/12'>ISA 53:12</a>. Since the Greek verb anapherōcan mean both ""to take away"" and ""to bear,"" the author no doubt intended to play upon both senses: Jesus took away sin by bearing it himself. See the similar wordplay in <a href='/NABRE/43/1/29'>JHN 1:29</a>. Manyis used in the Semitic meaning of ""all"" in the inclusive sense, as in <a href='/NABRE/41/14/24'>MAK 14:24</a>. To those who eagerly await him: Jesus will appear a second timeat the parousia, as the high priest reappeared on the Day of Atonement, emerging from the Holy of Holies, which he had entered to take away sin. This dramatic scene is described in <a href='/NABRE/71/50/5'>SIR 50:5-11</a>."
NABRE,58,10,1,"[1] 10:1-10 Christian faith now realizes that the Old Testament sacrifices did not effect the spiritual benefits to come but only prefigured them (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/1'>HEB 10:1</a>). For if the sacrifices had actually effected the forgiveness of sin, there would have been no reason for their constant repetition (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/2'>HEB 10:2</a>). They were rather a continual reminder of the peoples sins (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/3'>HEB 10:3</a>). It is not reasonable to suppose that human sins could be removed by the blood of animal sacrifices (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/4'>HEB 10:4</a>). Christ, therefore, is here shown to understand his mission in terms of <a href='/NABRE/19/40/6'>PS 40:6-8</a>, cited according to the Septuagint (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/5'>HEB 10:5-7</a>). Jesus acknowledged that the Old Testament sacrifices did not remit the sins of the people and so, perceiving the will of God, offered his own body for this purpose (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/8'>HEB 10:8-10</a>)."
NABRE,58,10,1,"[2] A shadow of the good things to come: the term shadowwas used in <a href='/NABRE/58/8/5'>HEB 8:5</a> to signify the earthly counterpart of the Platonic heavenly reality. But here it means a prefiguration of what is to come in Christ, as it is used in the Pauline literature; cf. <a href='/NABRE/51/2/17'>COL 2:17</a>."
NABRE,58,10,5,"[3] 10:5-7 A passage from <a href='/NABRE/19/40/7'>PS 40:7-9</a> is placed in the mouth of the Son at his incarnation. As usual, the author follows the Septuagint text. There is a notable difference in <a href='/NABRE/58/10/5'>HEB 10:5</a> (<a href='/NABRE/19/40/6'>PS 40:6</a>), where the Masoretic text reads ""ears you have dug for me"" (""ears open to obedience you gave me,"" NAB), but most Septuagint manuscripts have ""a body you prepared for me,"" a reading obviously more suited to the interpretation of Hebrews."
NABRE,58,10,8,"[4] Sacrifices and offerings, holocausts and sin offerings: these four terms taken from the preceding passage of <a href='/NABRE/19/40/1'>PS 40</a> (with the first two changed to plural forms) are probably intended as equivalents to the four principal types of Old Testament sacrifices: peace offerings (<a href='/NABRE/3/3/1'>LEV 3</a>, here called sacrifices); cereal offerings (<a href='/NABRE/3/2/1'>LEV 2</a>, here called offerings); holocausts(<a href='/NABRE/3/1/1'>LEV 1</a>); and sin offerings(<a href='/NABRE/3/4/1'>LEV 4</a>-<a href='/NABRE/3/5/1'>5</a>). This last category includes the guilt offerings of <a href='/NABRE/3/5/14'>LEV 5:14-19</a>."
NABRE,58,10,11,"[5] 10:11-18 Whereas the levitical priesthood offered daily sacrifices that were ineffectual in remitting sin (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/11'>HEB 10:11</a>), Jesus offered a single sacrifice that won him a permanent place at Gods right hand. There he has only to await the final outcome of his work (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/12'>HEB 10:12-13</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a>). Thus he has brought into being in his own person the new covenant prophesied by Jeremiah (<a href='/NABRE/24/31/33'>JER 31:33-34</a>) that has rendered meaningless all other offerings for sin (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/14'>HEB 10:14-18</a>)."
NABRE,58,10,13,[6] Until his enemies are made his footstool: <a href='/NABRE/19/110/1'>PS 110:1</a> is again used; the reference here is to the period of time between the enthronement of Jesus and his second coming. The identity of the enemiesis not specified; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/25'>1CO 15:25-27</a>.
NABRE,58,10,15,"[7] 10:15-17 The testimony of the scriptures is now invoked to support what has just preceded. The passage cited is a portion of the new covenant prophecy of <a href='/NABRE/24/31/31'>JER 31:31-34</a>, which the author previously used in <a href='/NABRE/58/8/8'>HEB 8:8-12</a>."
NABRE,58,10,17,"[8] He also says: these words are not in the Greek text, which has only kai, ""also,"" but the expression ""after saying""in <a href='/NABRE/58/10/15'>HEB 10:15</a> seems to require such a phrase to divide the Jeremiah text into two sayings. Others understand ""the Lord says"" of <a href='/NABRE/58/10/16'>HEB 10:16</a> (here rendered says the Lord) as outside the quotation and consider <a href='/NABRE/58/10/16'>HEB 10:16</a>b as part of the second saying. Two ancient versions and a number of minuscules introduce the words ""then he said"" or a similar expression at the beginning of <a href='/NABRE/58/10/17'>HEB 10:17</a>."
NABRE,58,10,18,"[9] 10:19-39 Practical consequences from these reflections on the priesthood and the sacrifice of Christ should make it clear that Christians may now have direct and confident access to God through the person of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/19'>HEB 10:19-20</a>), who rules Gods house as high priest (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/21'>HEB 10:21</a>). They should approach God with sincerity and faith, in the knowledge that through baptism their sins have been remitted (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/22'>HEB 10:22</a>), reminding themselves of the hope they expressed in Christ at that event (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/23'>HEB 10:23</a>). They are to encourage one another to Christian love and activity (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/24'>HEB 10:24</a>), not refusing, no matter what the reason, to participate in the communitys assembly, especially in view of the parousia (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/25'>HEB 10:25</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/52/4/13'>1TS 4:13-18</a>). If refusal to participate in the assembly indicates rejection of Christ, no sacrifice exists to obtain forgiveness for so great a sin (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/26'>HEB 10:26</a>); only the dreadful judgment of God remains (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/27'>HEB 10:27</a>). For if violation of the Mosaic law could be punished by death, how much worse will be the punishment of those who have turned their backs on Christ by despising his sacrifice and disregarding the gifts of the holy Spirit (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/28'>HEB 10:28-29</a>). Judgment belongs to the Lord, and he enacts it by his living presence (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/30'>HEB 10:30-31</a>). There was a time when the spirit of their community caused them to welcome and share their sufferings (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/32'>HEB 10:32-34</a>). To revitalize that spirit is to share in the courage of the Old Testament prophets (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/26/20'>ISA 26:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/58/2/3'>HEB 2:3-4</a>), the kind of courage that must distinguish the faith of the Christian (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/35'>HEB 10:35-39</a>)."
NABRE,58,10,20,"[10] Through the veil, that is, his flesh: the term fleshis used pejoratively. As the temple veil kept people from entering the Holy of Holies (it was rent at Christs death, <a href='/NABRE/41/15/38'>MAK 15:38</a>), so the flesh of Jesus constituted an obstacle to approaching God."
NABRE,58,10,21,"[11] The house of God: this refers back to <a href='/NABRE/58/3/6'>HEB 3:6</a>, ""we are his house."""
NABRE,58,10,22,"[12] With our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience: as in <a href='/NABRE/58/9/13'>HEB 9:13</a> (see note there), the sprinkling motif refers to the Mosaic rite of cleansing from ritual impurity. This could produce only an external purification, whereas sprinkling with the blood of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/14'>HEB 9:14</a>) cleanses the conscience. Washed in pure water: baptism is elsewhere referred to as a washing; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/6/11'>1CO 6:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/49/5/26'>EPH 5:26</a>."
NABRE,58,10,25,"[13] Our assembly: the liturgical assemblyof the Christian community, probably for the celebration of the Eucharist. The day: this designation for the parousia also occurs in the Pauline letters, e.g., <a href='/NABRE/45/2/16'>ROM 2:16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/3/13'>1CO 3:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/52/5/2'>1TS 5:2</a>."

NABRE,58,10,28,"[15] Rejects the law of Moses: evidently not any sin against the law, but idolatry. <a href='/NABRE/5/17/2'>DEU 17:2-7</a> prescribed capital punishment for idolaters who were convicted on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
NABRE,58,10,32,"[16] After you had been enlightened: ""enlightenment"" is an ancient metaphor for baptism (cf. <a href='/NABRE/49/5/14'>EPH 5:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/9/11'>JHN 9:11</a>), but see <a href='/NABRE/58/6/4'>HEB 6:4</a> and the note there."
NABRE,58,10,37,"[17] 10:37-38 In support of his argument, the author uses <a href='/NABRE/35/2/3'>HAB 2:3-4</a> in a wording almost identical with the text of the Codex Alexandrinus of the Septuagint but with the first and second lines of <a href='/NABRE/58/10/4'>HEB 10:4</a> inverted. He introduces it with a few words from <a href='/NABRE/23/26/20'>ISA 26:20</a>: after just a brief moment. Note the Pauline usage of <a href='/NABRE/35/2/4'>HAB 2:4</a> in <a href='/NABRE/45/1/17'>ROM 1:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/3/11'>GAL 3:11</a>."
NABRE,58,11,1,"[1] Faith is the realization…evidence: the author is not attempting a precise definition. There is dispute about the meaning of the Greek words hypostasisand elenchos, here translated realizationand evidence, respectively. Hypostasisusually means ""substance,"" ""being"" (as translated in <a href='/NABRE/58/1/3'>HEB 1:3</a>), or ""reality"" (as translated in <a href='/NABRE/58/3/14'>HEB 3:14</a>); here it connotes something more subjective, and so realizationhas been chosen rather than ""assurance"" (RSV). Elenchos, usually ""proof,"" is used here in an objective sense and so translated evidencerather than the transferred sense of ""(inner) conviction"" (RSV)."
NABRE,58,11,3,[2] By faith…God: this verse does not speak of the faith of the Old Testament men and women but is in the first person plural. Hence it seems out of place in the sequence of thought.
NABRE,58,11,4,"[3] The ""Praise of the Ancestors"" in <a href='/NABRE/71/44/1'>SIR 44:1</a>-<a href='/NABRE/71/50/21'>50:21</a> gives a similar list of heroes. The Cain and Abel narrative in <a href='/NABRE/1/4/1'>GEN 4:1-16</a> does not mention Abels faith. It says, however, that God ""looked with favor on Abel and his offering"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/4/4'>GEN 4:4</a>); in view of <a href='/NABRE/58/11/6'>HEB 11:6</a> the author probably understood Gods favor to have been activated by Abels faith. Though dead, he still speaks: possibly because his blood ""cries out to me from the soil"" (<a href='/NABRE/1/4/10'>GEN 4:10</a>), but more probably a way of saying that the repeated story of Abel provides ongoing witness to faith."
NABRE,58,11,6,[4] One must believe not only that God existsbut that he is concerned about human conduct; the Old Testament defines folly as the denial of this truth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/19/52/2'>PS 52:2</a>.
NABRE,58,11,19,"[5] As a symbol: Isaacs ""return from death"" is seen as a symbolof Christs resurrection. Others understand the words en parabolēto mean ""in figure,"" i.e., the word deadis used figuratively of Isaac, since he did not really die. But in the one other place that parabolēoccurs in Hebrews, it means symbol (<a href='/NABRE/58/9/9'>HEB 9:9</a>)."
NABRE,58,11,20,"[6] 11:20-22 Each of these three patriarchs, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph, had faith in the future fulfillment of Gods promise and renewed this faith when near death."
NABRE,58,11,24,[7] 11:24-27 The reason given for Moses departure from Egypt differs from the account in <a href='/NABRE/2/2/11'>EXO 2:11-15</a>. The author also gives a christological interpretation of his decision to share the trials of his people.
NABRE,58,11,40,[8] So that without us they should not be made perfect: the heroes of the Old Testament obtained their recompense only after the saving work of Christ had been accomplished. Thus they already enjoy what Christians who are still struggling do not yet possess in its fullness.
NABRE,58,12,1,"[1] 12:1-13 Christian life is to be inspired not only by the Old Testament men and women of faith (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/1'>HEB 12:1</a>) but above all by Jesus. As the architect of Christian faith, he had himself to endure the cross before receiving the glory of his triumph (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/2'>HEB 12:2</a>). Reflection on his sufferings should give his followers courage to continue the struggle, if necessary even to the shedding of blood (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/3'>HEB 12:3-4</a>). Christians should regard their own sufferings as the affectionate correction of the Lord, who loves them as a father loves his children."
NABRE,58,12,1,"[2] That clings to us: the meaning is uncertain, since the Greek word euperistatos, translated cling, occurs only here. The papyrus P46and one minuscule read euperispastos, ""easily distracting,"" which also makes good sense."
NABRE,58,12,15,"[3] 12:15-17 Esau serves as an example in two ways: his profaneattitude illustrates the danger of apostasy, and his inability to secure a blessing afterward illustrates the impossibility of repenting after falling away (see <a href='/NABRE/58/6/4'>HEB 6:4-6</a>)."
NABRE,58,12,18,"[4] 12:18-29 As a final appeal for adherence to Christian teaching, the two covenants, of Moses and of Christ, are compared. The Mosaic covenant, the author argues, is shown to have originated in fear of God and threats of divine punishment (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/18'>HEB 12:18-21</a>). The covenant in Christ gives us direct access to God (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/22'>HEB 12:22</a>), makes us members of the Christian community, Gods children, a sanctified people (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/23'>HEB 12:23</a>), who have Jesus as mediator to speak for us (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/24'>HEB 12:24</a>). Not to heed the voice of the risen Christ is a graver sin than the rejection of the word of Moses (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/25'>HEB 12:25-26</a>). Though Christians fall away, Gods kingdom in Christ will remain and his justice will punish those guilty of deserting it (<a href='/NABRE/58/12/28'>HEB 12:28-29</a>)."
NABRE,58,12,18,"[5] This remarkably beautiful passage contrasts two great assemblies of people: that of the Israelites gathered at Mount Sinai for the sealing of the old covenant and the promulgation of the Mosaic law, and that of the followers of Jesus gathered at Mount Zion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the assembly of the new covenant. This latter scene, marked by the presence of countless angelsand of Jesuswith his redeeming blood, is reminiscent of the celestial liturgies of the Book of Revelation."
NABRE,58,12,23,"[6] The assembly of the firstborn enrolled in heaven: this expression may refer to the angels of <a href='/NABRE/58/12/22'>HEB 12:22</a>, or to the heroes of the Old Testament (see <a href='/NABRE/58/11/1'>HEB 11</a>), or to the entire assembly of the new covenant."
NABRE,58,12,24,"[7] Speaks more eloquently: the blood of Abel, the first human blood to be shed, is contrasted with that of Jesus. Abels blood cried out from the earth for vengeance, but the blood of Jesus has opened the way for everyone, providing cleansing and access to God (<a href='/NABRE/58/10/19'>HEB 10:19</a>)."
NABRE,58,13,1,"[1] 13:1-16 After recommendations on social and moral matters (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/1'>HEB 13:1-6</a>), the letter turns to doctrinal issues. The fact that the original leaders are dead should not cause the recipients of this letter to lose their faith (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/7'>HEB 13:7</a>), for Christ still lives and he remains always the same (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/8'>HEB 13:8</a>). They must not rely for their personal sanctification on regulations concerning foods (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/9'>HEB 13:9</a>), nor should they entertain the notion that Judaism and Christianity can be intermingled (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/10'>HEB 13:10</a>; cf. notes on <a href='/NABRE/48/2/11'>GAL 2:11-14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/48/2/15'>2:15-21</a>). As Jesus died separated from his own people, so must the Christian community remain apart from the religious doctrines of Judaism (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/11'>HEB 13:11-14</a>). Christ must be the heart and center of the community (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/15'>HEB 13:15-16</a>)."
NABRE,58,13,9,"[2] Strange teaching: this doctrine about foodsprobably refers to the Jewish food laws; in view of <a href='/NABRE/58/13/10'>HEB 13:10</a>, however, the author may be thinking of the Mosaic sacrificial banquets."
NABRE,58,13,10,"[3] We have an altar: this does not refer to the Eucharist, which is never clearly mentioned in Hebrews, but to the sacrifice of Christ."
NABRE,58,13,17,"[4] 13:17-25 Recommending obedience to the leaders of the community, the author asks for prayers (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/17'>HEB 13:17-19</a>). The letter concludes with a blessing (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/20'>HEB 13:20-21</a>), a final request for the acceptance of its message (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/22'>HEB 13:22</a>), information regarding Timothy (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/23'>HEB 13:23</a>), and general greetings (<a href='/NABRE/58/13/24'>HEB 13:24-25</a>)."
NABRE,58,13,20,"[5] 13:20-21 These verses constitute one of the most beautiful blessings in the New Testament. The resurrection of Jesus is presupposed throughout Hebrews, since it is included in the authors frequently expressed idea of his exaltation, but this is the only place where it is explicitly mentioned."

NABRE,59,1,2,[2] Consider it all joy…various trials: a frequent teaching of the New Testament derived from the words and sufferings of Jesus (<a href='/NABRE/40/5/10'>MAT 5:10-12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/10/11'>JHN 10:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/5/41'>ACT 5:41</a>).
NABRE,59,1,3,"[3] 1:3-8 The sequence of testing, perseverance, and being perfect and complete indicates the manner of attaining spiritual maturity and full preparedness for the coming of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/59/5/7'>JAM 5:7-12</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/60/1/6'>1PE 1:6-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/5/3'>ROM 5:3-5</a>). These steps require wisdom (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/5'>JAM 1:5</a>)."
NABRE,59,1,5,"[4] Wisdom: a gift that God readily grants to all who ask in faith and that sustains the Christian in times of trial. It is a kind of knowledge or understanding not accessible to the unbeliever or those who doubt, which gives the recipient an understanding of the real importance of events. In this way a Christian can deal with adversity with great calm and hope (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/2/6'>1CO 2:6-12</a>)."
NABRE,59,1,9,"[5] 1:9-11 Throughout his letter (see <a href='/NABRE/59/2/5'>JAM 2:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/59/4/10'>4:10</a>, <a href='/NABRE/59/4/13'>13-16</a>; <a href='/NABRE/59/5/1'>5:1-6</a>), the author reaffirms the teaching of Jesus that worldly prosperity is not necessarily a sign of Gods favor but can even be a hindrance to proper humility before God (cf. <a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20-25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/12/16'>12:16-21</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/16/19'>16:19-31</a>)."
NABRE,59,1,12,"[6] Temptation: the Greek word used here is the same one used for ""trials"" in <a href='/NABRE/59/1/2'>JAM 1:2</a>. The crown of life: in ancient Palestine, crowns or wreaths of flowers were worn at festive occasions as signs of joy and honor. In the Hellenistic world, wreaths were given as a reward to great statesmen, soldiers, athletes. Life: here means eternal life. He promised: some manuscripts read ""God"" or ""the Lord,"" while the best witnesses do not specify the subject of ""promised."""
NABRE,59,1,13,"[7] 1:13-15 It is contrary to what we know of God for God to be the author of human temptation (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/13'>JAM 1:13</a>). In the commission of a sinful act, one is first beguiled by passion (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/14'>JAM 1:14</a>), then consent is given, which in turn causes the sinful act. When sin permeates the entire person, it incurs the ultimate penalty of death (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/15'>JAM 1:15</a>)."
NABRE,59,1,16,"[8] 1:16-18 The author here stresses that God is the source of all good and of good alone, and the evil of temptation does not come from him."
NABRE,59,1,17,"[9] All good giving and every perfect giftmay be a proverb written in hexameter. Father of lights: God is here called the Father of the heavenly luminaries, i.e., the stars, sun, and moon that he created (<a href='/NABRE/1/1/14'>GEN 1:14-18</a>). Unlike orbs moving from nadir to zenith, he never changes or diminishes in brightness."
NABRE,59,1,18,"[10] Acceptance of the gospel message, the word of truth, constitutes new birth (<a href='/NABRE/43/3/5'>JHN 3:5-6</a>) and makes the recipient the firstfruits(i.e., the cultic offering of the earliest grains, symbolizing the beginning of an abundant harvest) of a new creation; cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/15/20'>1CO 15:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/8/23'>ROM 8:23</a>."
NABRE,59,1,19,"[11] 1:19-25 To be quick to hearthe gospel is to accept it readily and to act in conformity with it, removing from ones soul whatever is opposed to it, so that it may take root and effect salvation (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/19'>JAM 1:19-21</a>). To listen to the gospel message but not practice it is failure to improve oneself (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/22'>JAM 1:22-24</a>). Only conformity of life to the perfect law of true freedom brings happiness (<a href='/NABRE/59/1/25'>JAM 1:25</a>)."
NABRE,59,1,25,[12] Peers into the perfect law: the image of a person doing this is paralleled to that of hearing Gods word. The perfect lawapplies the Old Testament description of the Mosaic law to the gospel of Jesus Christ that brings freedom.
NABRE,59,1,26,[13] 1:26-27 A practical application of <a href='/NABRE/59/1/22'>JAM 1:22</a> is now made.
NABRE,59,1,26,"[14] For control of the tongue, see note on <a href='/NABRE/59/3/1'>JAM 3:1-12</a>."
NABRE,59,1,27,"[15] In the Old Testament, orphans and widows are classical examples of the defenseless and oppressed."
NABRE,59,2,1,"[1] 2:1-13 In the Christian community there must be no discrimination or favoritism based on status or wealth (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/2'>JAM 2:2-4</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/5/3'>MAT 5:3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/11/5'>11:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/23/6'>23:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/1/27'>1CO 1:27-29</a>). Divine favor rather consists in Gods election and promises (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/5'>JAM 2:5</a>). The rich who oppress the poor blaspheme the name of Christ (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/6'>JAM 2:6-7</a>). By violating one law of love of neighbor, they offend against the whole law (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/8'>JAM 2:8-11</a>). On the other hand, conscious awareness of the final judgment helps the faithful to fulfill the whole law (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/12'>JAM 2:12</a>)."
NABRE,59,2,4,"[2] When Christians show favoritism to the rich they are guilty of the worst kind of prejudice and discrimination. The author says that such Christians set themselves up as judges who judge not by divine law but by the basest, self-serving motives."
NABRE,59,2,5,"[3] The poor, ""Gods poor"" of the Old Testament, were seen by Jesus as particularly open to God for belief in and reliance on him alone (<a href='/NABRE/42/6/20'>LUK 6:20</a>). Gods law cannot tolerate their oppression in any way (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/9'>JAM 2:9</a>)."
NABRE,59,2,8,"[4] Royal: literally, ""kingly""; because the Mosaic law came from God, the universal king. There may be an allusion to Jesus uses of this commandment in his preaching of the kingdom of God (<a href='/NABRE/40/22/39'>MAT 22:39</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/12/31'>MAK 12:31</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/10/27'>LUK 10:27</a>)."
NABRE,59,2,12,"[5] 2:12-13 The law upon which the last judgment will be based is the law of freedom. As Jesus taught, mercy (which participates in Gods own loving mercy) includes forgiveness of those who wrong us (see <a href='/NABRE/40/6/12'>MAT 6:12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/40/6/14'>14-15</a>)."
NABRE,59,2,13,"[6] 2:14-26 The theme of these verses is the relationship of faith and works (deeds). It has been argued that the teaching here contradicts that of Paul (see especially <a href='/NABRE/45/4/5'>ROM 4:5-6</a>). The problem can only be understood if the different viewpoints of the two authors are seen. Paul argues against those who claim to participate in Gods salvation because of their good deeds as well as because they have committed themselves to trust in God through Jesus Christ (Pauls concept of faith). Paul certainly understands, however, the implications of true faith for a life of love and generosity (see <a href='/NABRE/48/5/6'>GAL 5:6</a>, <a href='/NABRE/48/5/13'>13-15</a>). The author of James is well aware that proper conduct can only come about with an authentic commitment to God in faith (<a href='/NABRE/59/2/18'>JAM 2:18, 26</a>). Many think he was seeking to correct a misunderstanding of Pauls view."
NABRE,59,3,1,"[1] 3:1-12 The use and abuse of the important role of teaching in the church (<a href='/NABRE/59/3/1'>JAM 3:1</a>) are here related to the good and bad use of the tongue (<a href='/NABRE/59/3/9'>JAM 3:9-12</a>), the instrument through which teaching was chiefly conveyed (see <a href='/NABRE/71/5/11'>SIR 5:11</a>-<a href='/NABRE/71/6/1'>6:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/71/28/12'>28:12-26</a>)."
NABRE,59,3,12,"[2] 3:13-18 This discussion of true wisdom is related to the previous reflection on the role of the teacher as one who is in control of his speech. The qualities of the wise man endowed from above are detailed (<a href='/NABRE/59/3/17'>JAM 3:17-18</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/48/5/22'>GAL 5:22-23</a>), in contrast to the qualities of earthbound wisdom (<a href='/NABRE/59/3/14'>JAM 3:14-16</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/12/20'>2CO 12:20</a>)."
NABRE,59,4,1,"[1] 4:1-12 The concern here is with the origin of conflicts in the Christian community. These are occasioned by love of the world, which means enmity with God(<a href='/NABRE/59/4/4'>JAM 4:4</a>). Further, the conflicts are bound up with failure to pray properly (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/7/7'>MAT 7:7-11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/14/13'>JHN 14:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/15/7'>15:7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/16/23'>16:23</a>), that is, not asking God at all or using Gods kindness only for ones pleasure (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/2'>JAM 4:2-3</a>). In contrast, the proper dispositions are submission to God, repentance, humility, and resistance to evil (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/7'>JAM 4:7-10</a>)."
NABRE,59,4,1,"[2] 4:1-3 Passions: the Greek word here (literally, ""pleasures"") does not indicate that pleasure is evil. Rather, as the text points out (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/2'>JAM 4:2-3</a>), it is the manner in which one deals with needs and desires that determines good or bad. The motivation for any action can be wrong, especially if one does not pray properly but seeks only selfish enjoyment (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/3'>JAM 4:3</a>)."
NABRE,59,4,4,"[3] Adulterers: a common biblical image for the covenant between God and his people is the marriage bond. In this image, breaking the covenant with God is likened to the unfaithfulness of adultery."
NABRE,59,4,5,"[4] The meaning of this saying is difficult because the author of James cites, probably from memory, a passage that is not in any extant manuscript of the Bible. Other translations of the text with a completely different meaning are possible: ""The Spirit that he (God) made to dwell in us yearns (for us) jealously,"" or, ""He (God) yearns jealously for the spirit that he has made to dwell in us."" If this last translation is correct, the author perhaps had in mind an apocryphal religious text that echoes the idea that God is zealous for his creatures; cf. <a href='/NABRE/2/20/5'>EXO 20:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/5/4/24'>DEU 4:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/38/8/2'>ZEC 8:2</a>."
NABRE,59,4,6,"[5] The point of this whole argument is that God wants the happiness of all, but that selfishness and pride can make that impossible. We must work with him in humility (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/10'>JAM 4:10</a>)."
NABRE,59,4,11,[6] Slander of a fellow Christian does not break just one commandment but makes mockery of the authority of law in general and therefore of God.
NABRE,59,4,12,"[7] 4:13-17 The uncertainty of life (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/14'>JAM 4:14</a>), its complete dependence on God, and the necessity of submitting to Gods will (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/15'>JAM 4:15</a>) all help one know and do what is right (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/17'>JAM 4:17</a>). To disregard this is to live in pride and arrogance (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/16'>JAM 4:16</a>); failure to do what is right is a sin (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/17'>JAM 4:17</a>)."
NABRE,59,4,14,"[8] Some important Greek manuscripts here have, ""You who have no idea what tomorrow will bring. Why, what is your life?"""
NABRE,59,4,15,"[9] If the Lord wills it: often in piety referred to as the ""conditio Jacobaea,"" the condition James says we should employ to qualify all our plans."
NABRE,59,4,17,"[10] It is a sin: those who live arrogantly, forgetting the contingency of life and our dependence on God (<a href='/NABRE/59/4/13'>JAM 4:13-16</a>), are guilty of sin."
NABRE,59,5,1,"[1] 5:1-6 Continuing with the theme of the transitory character of life on earth, the author points out the impending ruin of the godless. He denounces the unjust rich, whose victims cry to heaven for judgment on their exploiters (<a href='/NABRE/59/5/4'>JAM 5:4-6</a>). The decay and corrosion of the costly garments and metals, which symbolize wealth, prove them worthless and portend the destruction of their possessors (<a href='/NABRE/59/5/2'>JAM 5:2-3</a>)."
NABRE,59,5,6,"[2] The author does not have in mind any specific crime in his readers communities but rather echoes the Old Testament theme of the harsh oppression of the righteous poor (see <a href='/NABRE/20/1/11'>PRO 1:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/70/2/10'>WIS 2:10, 12</a>, <a href='/NABRE/70/2/20'>20</a>)."

It is then that they will receive their reward (<a href='/NABRE/59/5/7'>JAM 5:7-8</a>, <a href='/NABRE/59/5/10'>10-11</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/58/10/25'>HEB 10:25</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/2/18'>1JN 2:18</a>)."

NABRE,59,5,12,"[5] This is the threat of condemnation for the abuse of swearing oaths (cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/5/33'>MAT 5:33-37</a>). By heaven or by earth: these words were substitutes for the original form of an oath, to circumvent its binding force and to avoid pronouncing the holy name of God (see <a href='/NABRE/2/22/10'>EXO 22:10</a>)."
NABRE,59,5,14,"[6] In case of sickness a Christian should ask for the presbyters of the church, i.e., those who have authority in the church (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/15/2'>ACT 15:2</a>, <a href='/NABRE/44/15/22'>22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/5/17'>1TM 5:17</a>; <a href='/NABRE/56/1/5'>TIT 1:5</a>). They are to pray over the person and anoint with oil; oil was used for medicinal purposes in the ancient world (see <a href='/NABRE/23/1/6'>ISA 1:6</a>; <a href='/NABRE/42/10/34'>LUK 10:34</a>). In <a href='/NABRE/41/6/13'>MAK 6:13</a>, the Twelve anoint the sick with oil on their missionary journey. In the name of the Lord: by the power of Jesus Christ."
NABRE,59,5,15,"[7] The results of the prayer and anointing are physical health and forgiveness of sins. The Roman Catholic Church (Council of Trent, Session 14) declared that this anointing of the sick is a sacrament ""instituted by Christ and promulgated by blessed James the apostle."""
NABRE,59,5,20,"[8] When a Christian is instrumental in the conversion of a sinner, the result is forgiveness of sins and a reinstatement of the sinner to the life of grace."
NABRE,60,1,1,"[1] 1:1-2 The introductory formula names Peteras the writer (but see Introduction). In his comments to the presbyters (<a href='/NABRE/60/5/1'>1PE 5:1</a>), the author calls himself a ""fellow presbyter."" He addresses himself to the Gentile converts of Asia Minor. Their privileged status as a chosenand sanctified people makes them worthy of Gods graceand peace. In contrast is their actual existence as aliens and sojourners, scattered among pagans, far from their true country."

The new birth is a sign of an imperishable inheritance(<a href='/NABRE/60/1/4'>1PE 1:4</a>), of salvationthat is still in the future (to be revealed in the final time, <a href='/NABRE/60/1/5'>1PE 1:5</a>)."

As Noahs family was saved through water, so Christians are saved through the waters of baptism (<a href='/NABRE/60/3/19'>1PE 3:19-22</a>).

The doxology (<a href='/NABRE/61/3/18'>2PE 3:18</a>) recalls <a href='/NABRE/60/4/11'>1PE 4:11</a>. Some manuscripts add Amen."
NABRE,62,1,1,"[1] 1:1-4 There is a striking parallel to the prologue of the gospel of John (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/1'>JHN 1:1-18</a>), but the emphasis here is not on the preexistent Word but rather on the apostles witness to the incarnation of life by their experience of the historical Jesus. He is the Word of life(<a href='/NABRE/62/1/1'>1JN 1:1</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/4'>JHN 1:4</a>), the eternal life that was with the Father and was made visible(<a href='/NABRE/62/1/2'>1JN 1:2</a>; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/1/14'>JHN 1:14</a>), and was heard, seen, looked upon, and touchedby the apostles.

Fellowship with God and with one another consists in a life according to the truth as found in God and in Christ."
NABRE,62,1,8,[3] 1:8-10 Denial of the condition of sin is self-deception and even contradictory of divine revelation; there is also the continual possibility of sins recurrence. Forgiveness and deliverance from sin through Christ are assured through acknowledgment of them and repentance.
NABRE,62,2,1,"[1] Children: like the term ""beloved,"" this is an expression of pastoral love (cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/13/33'>JHN 13:33</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/21/5'>21:5</a>; <a href='/NABRE/46/4/14'>1CO 4:14</a>). Advocate: for the use of the term, see <a href='/NABRE/43/14/16'>JHN 14:16</a>. Forgiveness of sin is assured through Christs intercession and expiation or ""offering""; the death of Christ effected the removal of sin."
NABRE,62,2,3,"[2] 2:3-6 The way we may be sure: to those who claim, ""I have known Christ and therefore I know him,"" our author insists on not mere intellectual knowledge but obedience to Gods commandments in a life conformed to the example of Christ; this confirms our knowledge of him and is the love of God…perfected. Disparity between moral life and the commandments proves improper belief."
NABRE,62,2,6,[3] 2:7-11 The author expresses the continuity and freshness of mutual charity in Christian experience. Through Christ the commandment of love has become the lightdefeating the darknessof evil in a new age. All hatred as darkness is incompatible with the light and Christian life. Note also the characteristic Johannine polemic in which a positive assertion is emphasized by the negative statement of its opposite.

NABRE,62,2,18,"[9] It is the last hour: literally, ""a last hour,"" the period between the death and resurrection of Christ and his second coming.

Many antichrists: Matthew, Mark, and Revelation seem to indicate a collectivity of persons, here related to the false teachers."
NABRE,62,2,19,[10] Not really of our number: the apostate teachers only proved their lack of faith by leaving the community.
NABRE,62,2,20,"[11] The anointing that comes from the holy one: this anointing is in the Old Testament sense of receiving the Spirit of God. The holy oneprobably refers to Christ. True knowledge is the gift of the Spirit (cf. <a href='/NABRE/23/11/2'>ISA 11:2</a>), and the function of the Spirit is to lead Christians to the truth (<a href='/NABRE/43/14/17'>JHN 14:17, 26</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/16/13'>16:13</a>)."
NABRE,62,2,22,"[12] 2:22-23 Certain gnostics denied that the earthly Jesus was the Christ; to deny knowledge of the Son is to deny the Father, since only through the Son has God been fully revealed (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/18'>JHN 1:18</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/14/8'>14:8-9</a>)."

NABRE,62,3,4,"[3] Lawlessness: a reference to the activity of the antichrist, so it is expressed as hostility toward God and a rejection of Christ. The author goes on to contrast the states of sin and righteousness. Christians do not escape sin but realize that when they sin they cease to have fellowship with God. Virtue and sin distinguish the children of God from the children of the devil."
NABRE,62,3,9,"[4] A habitual sinner is a child of the devil, while a child of God, who by definition is in fellowship with God, cannot sin. Seed: Christ or the Spirit who shares the nature of God with the Christian."
NABRE,62,3,11,"[5] 3:11-18 Love, even to the point of self-sacrifice, is the point of the commandment. The story of Cain and Abel (<a href='/NABRE/62/3/12'>1JN 3:12-15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/1/4/1'>GEN 4:1-16</a>) presents the rivalry of two brothers, in a contrast of evil and righteousness, where envy led to murder. For Christians, proof of deliverance is love toward others, after the example of Christ. This includes concrete acts of charity, out of our material abundance."
NABRE,62,3,18,[6] 3:19-24 Living a life of faith in Jesus and of Christian love assures us of abiding in God no matter what our feelings may at times tell us. Our obedience gives us confidence in prayer and trust in Gods judgment. This obedience includes our belief in Christ and love for one another.
NABRE,62,3,19,"[7] 3:19b-20 This difficult passage may also be translated ""we shall be at peace before him in whatever our hearts condemn, for…"" or ""and before God we shall convince our hearts, if our hearts condemn us, that God is greater than our hearts."""
NABRE,62,4,1,"[1] 4:1-6 Deception is possible in spiritual phenomena and may be tested by its relation to Christian doctrine (cf. <a href='/NABRE/46/12/3'>1CO 12:3</a>): those who fail to acknowledge Jesus Christ in the flesh are false prophets and belong to the antichrist. Even though these false prophets are well received in the world, the Christian who belongs to God has a greater power in the truth."
NABRE,62,4,3,"[2] Does not acknowledge Jesus: some ancient manuscripts add ""Christ"" and/or ""to have come in the flesh"" (cf. <a href='/NABRE/62/4/2'>1JN 4:2</a>), and others read ""every spirit that annuls (or severs) Jesus."""
NABRE,62,4,7,"[3] 4:7-12 Love as we share in it testifies to the nature of God and to his presence in our lives. One who loves shows that one is a child of God and knows God, for Gods very being is love; one without love is without God. The revelation of the nature of Gods love is found in the free gift of his Son to us, so that we may share life with God and be delivered from our sins. The love we have for one another must be of the same sort: authentic, merciful; this unique Christian love is our proof that we know God and can ""see"" the invisible God."
NABRE,62,4,13,"[4] 4:13-21 The testimony of the Spirit and that of faith join the testimony of love to confirm our knowledge of God. Our love is grounded in the confession of Jesus as the Son of God and the example of Gods love for us. Christian life is founded on the knowledge of God as love and on his continuing presence that relieves us from fear of judgment (<a href='/NABRE/62/4/16'>1JN 4:16-18</a>). What Christ is gives us confidence, even as we live and love in this world. Yet Christian love is not abstract but lived in the concrete manner of love for one another."

Faith, the acceptance of Jesus in his true character and the obedience in love to Gods commands (<a href='/NABRE/62/5/3'>1JN 5:3</a>), is the source of the Christians power in the world and conquers the world of evil (<a href='/NABRE/62/5/4'>1JN 5:4-5</a>), even as Christ overcame the world (<a href='/NABRE/43/16/33'>JHN 16:33</a>)."

To deny this is to deny Gods truth; cf. <a href='/NABRE/43/8/17'>JHN 8:17-18</a>. The gist of the divine witness or testimonyis that eternal life(<a href='/NABRE/62/5/11'>1JN 5:11-12</a>) is given in Christ and nowhere else.

Even in the latter case, however, prayer, while not enjoined, is not forbidden. The letter concludes with a summary of the themes of the letter (<a href='/NABRE/62/5/18'>1JN 5:18-20</a>). There is a sharp antithesis between the children of God and those belonging to the world and to the evil one. The Son reveals the God of truth; Christians dwell in the true God, in his Son, and have eternal life. The final verse (<a href='/NABRE/62/5/21'>1JN 5:21</a>) voices a perennial warning about idols, any type of rival to God."

NABRE,63,1,3,"[2] 3 Grace, mercy, and peace: like 1 Timothy; 2 Timothy this letter adds mercyto the terms used frequently in a salutation to describe Christian blessing; it appears only here in the Johannine writings. The author also puts the blessing in relation to truthand love, the watchwords of the Johannine teaching. The Fathers Son: the title that affirms the close relationship of Christ to God; similar variations of this title occur elsewhere (<a href='/NABRE/43/1/14'>JHN 1:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/43/3/35'>3:35</a>), but the precise wording is not found elsewhere in the New Testament."
NABRE,63,1,4,"[3] 4 Some of your children: this refers to those whom the Presbyter has recently encountered, but it may also indicate the presence of false doctrine in the community: the Presbyter encourages those who have remained faithful. Walking in the truth: an expression used in the Johannine writings to describe a way of living in which the Christian faith is visibly expressed; cf. <a href='/NABRE/62/1/6'>1JN 1:6-7</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/2/6'>2:6, 11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/64/1/3'>3JN 1:3</a>."

NABRE,63,1,8,"[6] 8 You(plural): it is not certain whether this means the Christians addressed or includes the Presbyter, since some of the ancient Greek manuscripts and Greek Fathers have ""we."""
NABRE,63,1,9,"[7] 9 Anyone who is so ""progressive"": literally, ""Anyone who goes ahead."" Some gnostic groups held the doctrine of the Christ come in the flesh to be a first step in belief, which the more advanced and spiritual believer surpassed and abandoned in his knowledge of the spiritual Christ. The author affirms that fellowship with God may be gained only by holding to the complete doctrine of Jesus Christ (<a href='/NABRE/62/2/22'>1JN 2:22-23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/4/2'>4:2</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/5/5'>5:5-6</a>)."
NABRE,63,1,10,[8] 10-11 At this time false teachers were considered so dangerous and divisive as to be shunned completely. From this description they seem to be wandering preachers. We see here a natural suspicion of early Christians concerning such itinerants and can envisage the problems faced by missionaries such as those mentioned in <a href='/NABRE/64/1/10'>3JN 1:10</a>.
NABRE,63,1,12,"[9] 12 Our joy: a number of other Greek manuscripts read ""your joy."""
NABRE,63,1,13,"[10] 13 Chosen sister: the community of which the Presbyter is now a part greets you (singular), the community of the Lady addressed."
NABRE,64,1,1,[11] 1 Beloved Gaius: a frequent form of address for fellow Christians in New Testament epistolary literature.
NABRE,64,1,3,"[12] 3 The brothers: in this letter, the term may refer to Christians who have been missionaries and received hospitality from Gaius (<a href='/NABRE/64/1/5'>3JN 1:5-6</a>). Walk in the truth: the common Johannine term to describe Christian living; this description presents Gaius as following the teachings of the Presbyter in contrast to Diotrephes."
NABRE,64,1,5,[13] 5 You are faithful in all you do: Gaiuss aid to the missionaries is a manifestation of his true Christian faith.
NABRE,64,1,6,[14] 6 Help them…to continue their journey: the Presbyter asks Gaius not only to continue to welcome the missionaries to his community but also to equip them for further travels.
NABRE,64,1,7,"[15] 7 The Name: of Jesus Christ (cf. <a href='/NABRE/44/5/41'>ACT 5:41</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/2/12'>1JN 2:12</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/3/23'>3:23</a>; <a href='/NABRE/62/5/13'>5:13</a>). Accepting nothing: not expecting support from the pagans to whom they preach the gospel, so that they will not be considered as beggars; they required support from other Christians; cf. Pauls complaints to the Corinthians (<a href='/NABRE/46/9/3'>1CO 9:3-12</a>)."
NABRE,64,1,9,[16] 9 Who loves to dominate: the Presbyter does not deny Diotrephes place as leader but indicates that his ambition may have caused him to disregard his letter and his influence.
NABRE,64,1,10,[17] 10 If I come: the Presbyter may visit the community to challenge the actions of Diotrephes toward himself and the missionaries. Will not receive the brothers: Diotrephes may have been critical of the teachings of the Presbyter and sought to maintain doctrinal purity; cf. <a href='/NABRE/62/2/19'>1JN 2:19</a> and <a href='/NABRE/63/1/10'>2JN 1:10-11</a>.
NABRE,64,1,11,[18] 11 Do not imitate evil: Gaius should not be influenced by the behavior of Diotrephes.
NABRE,64,1,12,"[19] 12 Demetrius: because of the fear of false teachers, Demetrius, perhaps the bearer of the letter, is provided with a recommendation from the Presbyter; cf. <a href='/NABRE/47/3/1'>2CO 3:1</a>; <a href='/NABRE/45/16/1'>ROM 16:1</a>. Even from the truth itself: this refers probably to the manner of Demetriuss life that testifies to his true belief; cf. Gaius above (<a href='/NABRE/64/1/3'>3JN 1:3</a>)."
NABRE,64,1,15,"[20] 15 Friends: although a Johannine term for Christians (<a href='/NABRE/43/15/15'>JHN 15:15</a>), the word here may refer to those in the community loyal to the Presbyter and to Gaius."
NABRE,65,1,1,"[21] 1 Jude…brother of James: for the identity of the author of this letter, see Introduction. To those who are called: the vocation to the Christian faith is Gods free gift to those whom he loves and whom he safely protects in Christ until the Lords second coming."
NABRE,65,1,3,[22] 3-4 Our common salvation: the teachings of the Christian faith derived from the apostolic preaching and to be kept by the Christian community.
NABRE,65,1,5,"[23] 5 For this first example of divine punishment on those who had been saved but did not then keep faith, see <a href='/NABRE/4/14/28'>NUM 14:28-29</a> and the note there. Some manuscripts have the word ""once"" (hapaxas at <a href='/NABRE/65/1/3'>JUD 1:3</a>) after ""you know""; some commentators have suggested that it means ""knowing one thing"" or ""you know all things once for all."" Instead of ""[the] Lord"" manuscripts vary, having ""Jesus,"" ""God,"" or no subject stated."
NABRE,65,1,6,[24] 6 This second example draws on <a href='/NABRE/1/6/1'>GEN 6:1-4</a> as elaborated in the apocryphal Book of Enoch (cf. <a href='/NABRE/65/1/14'>JUD 1:14</a>): heavenly beings came to earth and had sexual intercourse with women. God punished them by casting them out of heaven into darkness and bondage.
NABRE,65,1,7,"[25] 7 Practiced unnatural vice: literally, ""went after alien flesh."" This example derives from <a href='/NABRE/1/19/1'>GEN 19:1-25</a>, especially 4-11, when the townsmen of Sodom violated both hospitality and morality by demanding that Lots two visitors (really messengers of Yahweh) be handed over to them so that they could abuse them sexually. Unnatural vice: this refers to the desire for intimacies by human beings with angels (the reverse of the example in <a href='/NABRE/65/1/6'>JUD 1:6</a>). Sodom (whence ""sodomy"") and Gomorrah became proverbial as object lessons for Gods punishment on sin (<a href='/NABRE/23/1/9'>ISA 1:9</a>; <a href='/NABRE/24/50/40'>JER 50:40</a>; <a href='/NABRE/30/4/11'>AMO 4:11</a>; <a href='/NABRE/40/10/15'>MAT 10:15</a>; <a href='/NABRE/61/2/6'>2PE 2:6</a>)."

This may apply to claims they make for revelations they have received by night (to the author, hallucinations). Defile the flesh: this may mean bodily pollutions from the erotic dreams of sexual license (<a href='/NABRE/65/1/7'>JUD 1:7</a>). Lordship…glorious beings: these may reflect the Lord (<a href='/NABRE/65/1/5'>JUD 1:5</a>; Jesus, <a href='/NABRE/65/1/4'>JUD 1:4</a>) whom they spurn and the angels (<a href='/NABRE/65/1/6'>JUD 1:6</a>; cf. note on <a href='/NABRE/61/2/10'>2PE 2:10</a>, here, as there, literally, ""glories"")."
NABRE,65,1,9,"[27] 9 The archangel Michael…judgment: a reference to an incident in the apocryphal Assumption of Moses. <a href='/NABRE/5/34/6'>DEU 34:6</a> had said of Moses, literally in Greek, ""they buried him"" or ""he (God?) buried him"" (taken to mean ""he was buried""). The later account tells how Michael, who was sent to bury him, was challenged by the devils interest in the body. Our author draws out the point that if an archangel refrained from reviling even the devil, how wrong it is for mere human beings to revile glorious beings (angels)."

NABRE,65,1,18,[31] 18 This is the substance of much early Christian preaching rather than a direct quotation of any of the various New Testament passages on this theme (see <a href='/NABRE/41/13/22'>MAK 13:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/44/20/30'>ACT 20:30</a>; <a href='/NABRE/54/4/1'>1TM 4:1-3</a>; <a href='/NABRE/61/3/3'>2PE 3:3</a>).
NABRE,65,1,22,"[32] 22 Have mercy: some manuscripts read ""convince,"" ""confute,"" or ""reprove."" Others have ""even though you waver"" or ""doubt"" instead of who waver."
NABRE,65,1,23,"[1] 23 With fear: some manuscripts connect the phrase ""with fear"" with the imperative ""save"" or with the participle ""snatching."" Other manuscripts omit the phrase ""on others have mercy,"" so that only two groups are envisioned. Rescue of those led astray and caution in the endeavor are both enjoined. Outer garment stained by the flesh: the imagery may come from <a href='/NABRE/38/3/3'>ZEC 3:3-5</a>, just as that of snatching…out of the firecomes from <a href='/NABRE/38/3/2'>ZEC 3:2</a>; the very garments of the godless are to be abhorred because of their contagion."

There is no admonition; rather, the Christians are told that they will suffer much, even death, but the time of tribulation will be short compared to their eternal reward (<a href='/NABRE/66/2/10'>REV 2:10</a>), and they will thus escape final damnation (<a href='/NABRE/66/2/11'>REV 2:11</a>)."

NABRE,66,12,1,"[1] 12:1-14:20 This central section of Revelation portrays the power of evil, represented by a dragon, in opposition to God and his people. First, the dragon pursues the woman about to give birth, but her son is saved and ""caught up to God and his throne"" (<a href='/NABRE/66/12/5'>REV 12:5</a>). Then Michael and his angels cast the dragon and his angels out of heaven (<a href='/NABRE/66/12/7'>REV 12:7-9</a>). After this, the dragon tries to attack the boy indirectly by attacking members of his church (<a href='/NABRE/66/12/13'>REV 12:13-17</a>). A beast, symbolizing the Roman empire, then becomes the dragons agent, mortally wounded but restored to life and worshiped by all the world (<a href='/NABRE/66/13/1'>REV 13:1-10</a>). A second beast arises from the land, symbolizing the antichrist, which leads people astray by its prodigies to idolize the first beast (<a href='/NABRE/66/13/11'>REV 13:11-18</a>). This is followed by a vision of the Lamb and his faithful ones, and the proclamation of imminent judgment upon the world in terms of the wine of Gods wrath (<a href='/NABRE/66/14/1'>REV 14:1-20</a>)."
NABRE,66,12,1,"[2] 12:1-6 The woman adorned with the sun, the moon, and the stars (images taken from <a href='/NABRE/1/37/9'>GEN 37:9-10</a>) symbolizes Gods people in the Old and the New Testament.

NABRE,66,13,3,[3] This may be a reference to the popular legend that Nero would come back to life and rule again after his death (which occurred in A.D. 68 from a self-inflicted stab wound in the throat); cf. <a href='/NABRE/66/13/14'>REV 13:14</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/17/8'>REV 17:8</a>.

NABRE,66,13,5,"[5] 13:5-6 Domitian, like Antiochus IV Epiphanes (<a href='/NABRE/27/7/8'>DAN 7:8, 11</a>, <a href='/NABRE/27/7/25'>25</a>), demanded that he be called by divine titles such as ""our lord and god"" and ""Jupiter."" See note on <a href='/NABRE/66/11/2'>REV 11:2</a>."
NABRE,66,13,5,"[6] Forty-two months: this is the same duration as the profanation of the holy city (<a href='/NABRE/66/11/2'>REV 11:2</a>), the prophetic mission of the two witnesses (<a href='/NABRE/66/11/3'>REV 11:3</a>), and the retreat of the woman into the desert (<a href='/NABRE/66/12/6'>REV 12:6, 14</a>)."
NABRE,66,13,10,[7] 13:11-18 The second beast is described in terms of the false prophets (cf. <a href='/NABRE/66/16/13'>REV 16:13</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/19/20'>19:20</a>; <a href='/NABRE/66/20/10'>20:10</a>) who accompany the false messiahs (the first beast); cf. <a href='/NABRE/40/24/24'>MAT 24:24</a>; <a href='/NABRE/41/13/22'>MAK 13:22</a>; <a href='/NABRE/53/2/9'>2TS 2:9</a>; cf. also <a href='/NABRE/5/13/2'>DEU 13:2-4</a>. Christians had either to worship the emperor and his image or to suffer martyrdom.
NABRE,66,13,18,"[8] Each of the letters of the alphabet in Hebrew as well as in Greek has a numerical value. Many possible combinations of letters will add up to 666, and many candidates have been nominated for this infamous number. The most likely is the emperor Caesar Nero (see note on <a href='/NABRE/66/13/3'>REV 13:3</a>), the Greek form of whose name in Hebrew letters gives the required sum. (The Latin form of this name equals 616, which is the reading of a few manuscripts.) Nero personifies the emperors who viciously persecuted the church. It has also been observed that ""6"" represents imperfection, falling short of the perfect number ""7,"" and is represented here in a triple or superlative form."

NABRE,66,14,5,"[4] No deceit: because they did not deny Christ or do homage to the beast.
