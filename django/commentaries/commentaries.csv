AMP,1,1,1,"This is originally a plural form based on <i>el</i> (root meaning: strength), which itself is used to refer to God in compounds like <i>El Shaddai</i> (Almighty God). The word <i>el</i> is also used to refer to false gods, so the context determines whether <i>Elohim</i> means ""God"" or is better understood as ""gods"" (<i>elohim</i>)."
AMP,1,1,1,"Heb <i>bara</i>. Here and in <a href='/AMP/1/1/21'>1:21</a>, God created from nothing which is something only He can do. In <a href='/AMP/1/1/27'>1:27</a>, God used preexisting materials (man from the dust of the ground; Eve from Adams rib); each use of the word <i>bara</i> (""create"") must be considered in its specific context."
AMP,1,1,2,"The Hebrew text here has two rhyming words, <i>tohu</i> and <i>bohu</i>, which have similar meanings of ""wasteness"" and ""emptiness."" The construction is a figure of speech called <i>hendiadys</i>, in which two words are used together to express the same idea. The meaning is that the earth had no clearly discernible features at this point in creation but essentially was a mass of raw materials. This proves to be very important from philosophical and scientific viewpoints, because it documents the fact that the raw matter of the earth—and by extension, of the universe—did not coexist eternally with God, but was created by Him <i>ex nihilo</i> (Latin ""out of nothing"")."
AMP,1,1,3,"This is not in the imperative mood (the ordinary grammatical form for a command), but God willed these creative events into existence. It is the voluntative mood in Hebrew. This translates, ""It is My will that this happen."" English does not have the voluntative mood, which includes the jussive and cohortative forms. When ""let"" is used in this way, it represents a command not in the imperative mood, but rather an expression of Gods will, the jussive form. God literally commanded (willed) the world into existence."
AMP,1,1,4,"""He affirmed and sustained it"" is understood (deduced) from the context. The italic ""and"" alerts the reader or student of Hebrew that the word or words that follow are amplifications not found in the Hebrew text itself, but implied by it or by contextual factors."

The design of the ark matched its purpose, which was not to travel through the water efficiently, but to be stable and have the greatest possible capacity for cargo. Also, such a vessel could be constructed relatively quickly, because there would be no need to form the wood used for the hull into efficient curves to maximize speed."

AMP,1,6,14,"This prevented water from seeping into the ark through the seams between the wooden planks, and may also have served to protect the wood from becoming saturated with water. Coating the ark with pitch on the outside as well as the inside was very practical. One of the worst jobs on the old wooden ships was to re-coat the inside bottom of the hull when water had seeped in, because the crewman had to quickly pave hot pitch on the hull under the water, which cooled the pitch as he worked and made the job all the more difficult—thus the nautical saying, ""the devil (referring to the seam in the hull planking) to pay (i.e. pave with pitch)."" The problem was eliminated or minimized on the ark, but Noah, due to his complete inexperience with sea-going vessels, would not even have known about the potential problem himself.

A school was found and what the students studied was shown by the clay tablets discovered there. In the days of Abram the pupils had reading, writing, and arithmetic as today. They learned the multiplication and division tables and even worked at square and cube roots. A bill of lading of about 2040 B.C.

AMP,2,12,11,"A variation of a phrase often found in the Bible that is an urgent call to get ready for immediate action, or to prepare for a coming action or event. The phrase is related to the type of clothing worn in ancient times. To keep from impeding the wearer during any vigorous activity, e.g. battle, exercise, strenuous work, etc., the loose ends of garments (tunics, cloaks, mantles, etc.) had to be gathered up and tucked into the girdle. The girdle was a band about six inches wide that had fasteners in front. It was worn around the loins (the midsection of the body between the lower ribs and the hips) and was normally made of leather. The girdle (band) also served as a kind of pocket or pouch and was used to carry personal items such as a dagger, money or other necessary things. <i>Gird up your mind</i> or <i>gird up your heart</i> are examples of variants of this phrase and call for mental or spiritual preparation for a coming challenge."
AMP,2,12,15,"This is the first time leaven is mentioned in the Bible. The Hebrew word (<i>seor</i>) refers specifically to the leavening agent (as opposed to dough containing it), which today is thought of as yeast, a type of fungus. In Jewish thinking, leaven was symbolic of impurity and corruption. As leaven spreads through dough, sin spreads through a population. Jesus used it as a symbol for the corrupt and hypocritical teachings of the Pharisees and Sadducees (see especially <a href='/AMP/42/12/1'>LUK 12:1</a>; cf <a href='/AMP/40/16/11'>MAT 16:11</a>; <a href='/AMP/41/8/15'>MAK 8:15</a>), but He also used leavens ability to permeate a mass of dough many times its own size as an illustration of the spread of the kingdom of heaven (<a href='/AMP/40/13/33'>MAT 13:33</a>; <a href='/AMP/42/13/21'>LUK 13:21</a>)."

AMP,2,13,13,"For most Israelites, the donkey would eventually be important for their livelihoods as a work-animal, so God foresaw the need and allowed this exception. Those who had no need for an additional donkey were not required to redeem it, but were to kill it in recognition of Gods right to the firstborn. On the other hand, redemption was of course the only option for a firstborn son. God thereby honors His own right to the firstborn, but at the same time forbids human sacrifice."

AMP,2,16,3,"To understand Israels rebellious behavior, it is important to grasp the contrast between life in Egypt and nomadic life in the wilderness. Despite the hardships of slavery survival was not an issue in Egypt, where they were guaranteed food and other necessities. But the desert wilderness was hostile and unforgiving, and survival was an art. Desert nomads needed to understand the wilderness in order to stay alive; they had to learn, among other things, how to protect themselves from the weather, where to find water and pasture, and how to find and prepare scarce food, or live primarily from what their livestock could provide them. So the Israelites viewed every new problem they faced as life-threatening. Instead of looking back and taking comfort from Gods earlier miracles, they doubted Gods ability and willingness to help them. Their fears and doubts subsequently came to be expressed as irrational anger toward Moses."

Schliemann, the German archeologist, experienced a similar surprise in 1873 when he excavated the city of Troy, which Homer tells us withstood the Grecian warriors for quite some time. It would almost seem that these ancient cities were more like places of refuge for the areas population when an enemy approached.

To a disinterested observer, occupancy of the land of Canaan might simply be a matter of conquest by the stronger warring nation, so no one could claim true ownership and the land would naturally change hands over the course of history. For Israel, however, possession of the land was the will of God, pitting the one true God against the false gods of foreign nations who were being dispossessed. These other nations understandably did not see things Israels way because they did not recognize the sovereignty of Israels God, and might have felt just as strongly about their own gods will for them to possess the land in question. Therefore the struggle for land was not just the result of pragmatism or greed, or even the basic desire to have a secure home and country. It was seamlessly interwoven in the fabric of faith, a non-negotiable element of ones religion—or in Israels case, of faith in the true God, whom they frequently neglected or abandoned, to their own peril."

AMP,15,10,11,"The severity of Ezras policy is justified considering Israels tragic experiences resulting from marriages to pagan women. The consequent idolatry, first of King Solomon, and then of the whole nation, was fatal. Gods wrath had been so great that He not only took the kingship from Solomon, but eventually turned the Israelites over to their enemies and left the promised land desolate, while the people mourned their fate as captives in a pagan country. Ezra, to whom the keeping of Gods law was of constant concern, had been born in captivity among exiles who grieved for the country, peace and prosperity which God had once given them. Leading the exiles to give up their foreign wives and children was the only way to avoid Gods wrath."
AMP,15,10,15,"No reason is given for this opposition, though it would hardly seem strange if some of the people were concerned about the severity of Ezras instructions.

The French excavations at Susa in 1880-1890 uncovered the great palace of Xerxes, where Esther would have lived. The building covered two and one-half acres. The finds at Susa from this period were so astonishing that the Louvre in Paris devoted two large rooms to the exhibition of the treasures.

This is one such Messianic psalm; however, the capitalization indicating the deity is provided with the understanding that the chapter is written against the background of an ordinary royal wedding with anonymous participants.

But the writer of Hebrews clearly understood it this way."

Another rabbinic explanation is that when Pharaoh was about to elevate Joseph to power, the astrologers demanded that Joseph speak the 70 languages of the world.

No such prayer is recorded, but it is certainly possible that Phinehas prayed for relief before or after the execution.

There has been a great deal of discussion over the Hebrew word found here for <i>virgin</i> (<i>almah</i>) and the word that Matthew uses (<i>parthenos</i>). The latter refers unambiguously to a virgin, while the former (<i>almah</i>) has been said to refer to a young woman, in contrast to the Hebrew word <i>bethulah</i>, which is the equivalent of the Gr <i>parthenos</i>. It has also been noted that the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew OT, has <i>parthenos</i> here for <i>almah</i>, and that <a href='/AMP/40/1/23'>MAT 1:23</a> is taken from the Septuagint. Some have wondered why the Septuagint translators used the more specific word <i>parthenos</i>. It is fair to say that this question is the result of oversimplifying the vocabulary and misinterpreting the distinctions. The Hebrew words <i>almah</i> and <i>bethulah</i> can actually refer to the same kind of woman; <i>almah</i> is a youthful woman of marriageable age, one who has not yet had her first child, while <i>bethulah</i> is one who has not been touched in an intimate way. Furthermore, in the present context it would be unthinkable to infer that the woman might have had sexual relations outside of marriage. So the well-known translation of ""young woman"" for <i>almah</i>, while technically not incorrect, can be viewed as too ambiguous for the Hebrew word and the context. <i>Parthenos</i> was an appropriate choice in the Greek. Another word, <i>kore</i> (for ""girl"") could have been used, but it has a wider range of meaning than the Heb <i>almah</i> (Mark uses a related word, <i>korasion</i>, to translate Jesus Aramaic word <i>talitha</i>). It should also be acknowledged from a theological perspective that when Matthew cites the verse with <i>parthenos</i>, he thereby authenticates it as inspired."

They kept meticulous records of celestial motion and correctly calculated the length of a year to within just a few minutes.

Many commentators are of the opinion that the arrogance expressed here is satanic, and that the passage correctly represents Satans attitude because he was working through the Babylonian ruler. The Hebrew for this expression is translated ""Lucifer"" (""light-bringer"") in <i>The Latin Vulgate</i>, and is translated this way in the <i>King James Version</i>. But because of the association of that name with Satan, it is not used in this and other translations. Some students feel that the application of the name Lucifer to Satan, in spite of the long and confident teaching to that effect, is erroneous. The application of the name to Satan has existed since the third century A.D., and is based on the supposition that <a href='/AMP/42/10/18'>LUK 10:18</a> is an explanation of <a href='/AMP/23/14/12'>ISA 14:12</a>, which many authorities believe is not true.

This is how that prophecy was literally fulfilled: after Babylon was taken, the whole area around the city was put under water from neglect of the canals and dikes of the Euphrates River.

Later these cousins of the Israelites were pushed out of their own country into southern Judea; Hebron became their chief city. When in A.D. 70 the Romans under Titus besieged Jerusalem, Josephus says that the Edomites joined the Jews in rebellion against the attackers, and 20,000 were admitted into the city as defenders of the Holy City. But once in, they pillaged the city, raping and killing, not even sparing the priests—though these traitors themselves had been previously forced to become circumcised and recognized as Jews. The Roman conqueror destroyed them, and Edom ceased to be. The forecasts of the prophets regarding Edom are in striking contrast to those of their neighbors, Moab and Ammon. The latter two countries were to suffer great and severe judgments, as was Edom. But restoration and renewed prosperity were promised to them ""in the latter days"" (<a href='/AMP/24/48/47'>JER 48:47</a>; <a href='/AMP/24/49/6'>49:6</a>), while Edom was never to be rebuilt."

Afterwards they decided to buy the field for use as a burial ground for strangers. Peter goes on to say that Judas was disemboweled in a fall, while Matthew reports that Judas hanged himself (<a href='/AMP/40/27/5'>MAT 27:5</a>).

Nothing is known of Silas family background, but if his name is short for ""Silvanus,"" it is a Roman name (taken from the god of the forest) and it could be that Silas was also born a Roman citizen. Details on Roman citizenship at that time are sketchy at best, but it is clear from Acts that punishing a citizen without a trial and guilty verdict was illegal, probably involving severe penalties for the magistrates in charge. Also, a Roman citizen charged with a crime had the right to go to Rome and be tried in the emperors court ( <a href='/AMP/44/25/9'>25:9-12</a>)."

The altar to the Unknown seems to have been constructed for the purpose of acknowledging any god who had been overlooked. Paul seized upon it as an opportunity to introduce the Greeks to Christ."
AMP,44,17,25,"Here Paul uses an unusual word which normally refers to healing. He was educated in classical Greek literature to some extent (see note v <a href='/AMP/44/17/28'>28</a>; <a href='/AMP/44/22/3'>22:3</a>), and what he says here recalls earlier arguments by Plato (in his dialogues <i>the Euthyphro</i> and <i>the Symposium</i>) which should have struck a responsive chord in the listeners. In the dialogues, Plato represents Socrates as analyzing the nature of service to a god, and points out that the god can only receive actual benefit from service if he is in need or lacking something. Paul masterfully adapts himself to the thinking of the Athenians, demonstrating to them that the gods whom they serve with sacrifices and worship cannot really be gods at all, unless it is possible for a god to have faults or needs that have to be satisfied. This is also a good point for the Christian to bear in mind; believers are to serve God, but this is not a service that in any way actually benefits Him, because He is perfect and in no need of anything which man can supply. The same is true for the sacrificial system of the OT. While God is represented there as demanding sacrifices and sometimes enjoying their pleasant aromas, the sacrifices did not actually benefit Him. In reality they pointed ahead to the supreme sacrifice of Christ, which was the ultimate payment for mankinds sins."

Even the philosopher Plato maintained that vision essentially is the process of light forming an image of an object it touches and conveying that image to the eyes. So Paul may mean that what is actually seen is an image composed of light (like the photographic process), and since light is always reliable and its physical properties are constant, nothing exposed to light escapes being revealed.

These commit apostasy, depart from the fellowship, and thus give evidence they were not genuinely converted, and 4) the loss of rewards view that suggests that the context indicated the people described in vv <a href='/AMP/58/6/4'>4-6</a> are genuine believers who commit willful sin and fail to press on to maturity.

Jewish tradition maintained that every nation and individual has a guardian angel, and that when God is about to punish a nation, He first punishes its angel. There is even a story of Michael, the guardian angel of Israel, being rebuked by God for the sins committed in the time of Ezekiel. So the original readers of Revelation might have assumed that the angels here are the guardian angels of the individual churches, sharing responsibility for the actions of the members."

What John is most likely indicating is that the letters of the name will add up to 666 (the best Greek manuscripts have the number spelled out), and there could be many different combinations of letters that would do so. Determining the values of the individual letters is another matter. John probably assumed that the name would be Hebrew or Greek, and in Hebrew vowels for the most part are not represented as letters. Further complications arise when names from other nationalities are considered, and are converted for valuation. For example, at various times it has been argued that the name ""Nero Caesar"" adds up to 666 when transliterated to Hebrew as NRWN QSR (according to the Greek form); but in the Talmud, the name is transliterated as NYRWN QYSR, which totals 686.
